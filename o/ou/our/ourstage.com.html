	This Privacy Policy describes the information collection and use procedures at this website, located at OurStage.com ("Site"), owned by OurStage, Inc. This notice describes our online information collection and use practices at this Site.
</p>
<p>
	This privacy policy is effective as of April, 2008.

<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

</p>
<p>

Additionally, if you are the winner of a contest, OurStage will disclose your information as part of a publicly available winners' list, which may be posted on this Site or otherwise disclosed elsewhere, such as advertising and promotional materials. We may also use your information for other legitimate business purposes, including sending you notices about OurStage, its products and services, or asking for your input and feedback on our products and services. If you register for the first time on OurStage as an artist or as a fan in a sponsored channel, we will share your username, email address and zip code with the channel sponsor. If you previously registered on OurStage and then enter into a sponsored channel competition or sponsored channel sweepstakes, we will share your username, email address and zip code with the channel sponsor.
</p>
<p>
	As part of our regular business conduct, and regardless of whether you have opted out of having your information shared, we share information with third parties who help us deliver your requested services. We also will share your information in the event that there is a change of corporate ownership. We may also share information with government officials in order to cooperate with a legitimate investigation. We may also combine the information you submit to us with information we have collected from you in other forums, such as through emails or offline, or with publicly available information or information we obtain from third parties.
</p>
<p>

<p>
You may send messages to friends about Site by using the "send to a friend" feature, accessible at content pages. Information you submit in this feature will not be stored by OurStage, and will be used only to send the email you request.
</p>
<p>
