</p><h1>OurStory Privacy Statement</h1>
<br>
<h3>Effective as of 07/13/06</h3><br>
<p>This privacy statement ("Privacy Statement") covers the website <a href="http://www.ourstory.com/">www.OurStory.com</a>
(the "Site" or "OurStory"), owned and operated by Lifescape, LLC
("Lifescape"), and all OurStory services provided on the Site (the
"Service"). By visiting the Site, submitting information or using the
Service, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy
Statement. This Privacy Statement does not apply to the practices of
third parties that Lifescape does not own or control, or to individuals
that Lifescape does not employ or manage. Please contact us with
questions regarding this Privacy Statement.</p>
<br>
<p>
</p><h3>About OurStory and the Information We Collect</h3>
<p>
</p><p>OurStory is an online biography service that allows people to capture personal
histories online. To accomplish this, our users create their own
profiles, which are shown to the people in their personal network, or
if the user so chooses, to the general public. A personal network
consists of a user's friends and family as listed by the user on the
Site, plus the extended group of people that a user is connected to via
chains of mutual friends. Some personal information we ask for is
displayed to people within these personal networks. Users of the free
version can mark any post as (1) viewable by their personal network, or
(2) publicly viewable. Users of the Digital Family version can mark any post
on the Site as (1) private, (2) viewable by their personal network, or
(3) publicly viewable. </p>
<br>
<p>
</p><h3>Information Collected by Lifescape</h3>
<p>
</p><h3> Information Users Submit to Lifescape</h3>
<p>
</p><p>Lifescape
collects user-submitted account information such as name and email
address to identify users and send notifications related to the use of
the Service, such as the system-generated email 'starter question' set
or when those in their personal network add or update a posting. For
Digital Family accounts, users will be asked to submit financial information
such as their credit card number. Lifescape also collects
user-submitted profile information such as gender, age, occupation,
location, etc. This information is collected in order for us to
develop, improve, and tailor services to our users and to communicate
with certain groups of users based on their profile information. We may
also, for example, use it in aggregate form to tell advertisers about
our users' needs and interests. Lifescape also collects user-submitted
life experience accounts, photos and comments. You can choose not to
provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to
take advantage of many of the Site's special features.</p>
<br><p>
</p><h3>Information not Directly Submitted by Users to Lifescape</h3>
<p>
</p><p>
Lifescape
automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server
logs from your browser including your Internet Protocol address,
internet service provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages,
browser type and the webpage you request. This information is gathered
for all users of the Site. Lifescape uses this traffic data to help
diagnose problems with our server, analyze trends and administer the
Site. The Site also automatically collects usage information, such as
the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Site and its components.
This information is only used in the aggregate.</p>
<br><p>
</p><h3>Use of Information Obtained by Lifescape</h3>
<p>
</p><h3>Information Users Submit to Lifescape</h3>
<p>
</p><p>Profile
information as well as user name, life experience accounts, photos and
comments are displayed according to whether a user classifies his or
her posting on the Site as (1) private, (2) viewable by his or her
personal network, or (3) publicly viewable, to support the function of
the Site as an online biography service where users collaborate in the
collection of memories and life stories about individuals. Email
address and full name are used when a user invites a friend via email
to join the Service, when a user requests to add another user to his or
her friends list or when we send notifications to a user related to his
or her use of the Service (such as updates or news regarding the Site).
Except when inviting or adding friends, a user's email address is not
shared or displayed with people within a user's personal network. Users
within a personal network communicate with each other through the
Service without disclosing email addresses. A user's email address is
also used to send notifications when you or other users add or update
postings, ask questions create comments, send invitations, reset
passwords, create relationships, and create or share threads, as well
as when we receive a new user registration and when we receive payments
from you. Notifications are only sent from other users that you already
connected to. Although at this time we have no plans to send marketing
messages via email, you may opt out of email altogether, choose not to
receive email notifications in general, or opt out of notifications
from specific users by changing your settings in the <a href="http://www.ourstory.com/account_settings.html">Settings</a> section of the Site.</p>
<br><p>
</p><h3> Information not Directly Submitted by Users to Lifescape</h3>
<p>
</p><p>We use your server, Internet Protocol address, and browser-type related information in the general administration of the Site.</p> <p><br>
</p><p>
</p><h3>Sharing of the Information Lifescape Collects</h3> <br> <p>
</p><p>As
a matter of policy, except where you are expressly informed otherwise,
we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal
information, unless we have your consent. However, Lifescape may share
aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner to
advertisers, subsidiaries, affiliates and other third party service
providers only to the extent required for such third parties to provide
their services so that Lifescape can present to users more targeted
advertising, products and services. </p>
<br><p>
</p><p> We use outside
vendors to fulfill various services, such as a financial transaction
processing company to bill you for goods and services. When you sign up
for one of the services we offer, such as creating a printed book
containing your biography, we will share only that information
necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third
parties are prohibited by contract from using your personally
identifiable information for any other purpose. We may release personal
information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to
comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other
agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Lifescape,
our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging
information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection
and credit risk reduction.</p>
<br><p>
</p><p>In
some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of
transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets
that is transferred. Moreover, if Lifescape, or substantially all of
its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets
that is transferred. </p>
<br><p>
</p><p>Except as set forth above, you
will be notified through the Service by email and a notice on the web
site when your personal information may be shared with third parties. </p>
<br><p>
</p><h3>Links</h3>
<p></p><p>The
Site may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that
Lifescape is not responsible for the privacy practices, security or the
content of other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they
leave the Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every
website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy
Statement applies solely to information collected on this Site. </p> <br><p>
</p><h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>
</p><p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's computer tied to
information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and
persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the
browser, the cookie terminates. A persistent cookie is a text file
stored on a user's hard drive for an extended period of time. You may
be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some
cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set by following your Internet
browser's "Help" file instructions. However, you must enable cookies
from OurStory in order to use most functions on the Site. Cookies are
used to manage sessions on the Site. OurStory cookies do not collect
personal information. </p> <br><p>
</p><p>Also, users may optionally use a
cookie to remember their password in order to automatically log-in to
the Site. We do not use cookies to collect private information that a
user did not intentionally submit to us.</p>
<br><p></p><p> We use a
third-party tracking service WebSideStory that uses their own cookies
to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our
site in the aggregate including, but not limited to, page views,
referring websites, time spent on the site and exit points, to help us
improve the quality of the Service.</p>
<br><p> </p><p>This Privacy
Statement covers the use of cookies by Lifescape and does not cover the
use of cookies by any Web advertising partners, third-party ad servers
or ad networks.</p>
<br><p> </p><h3>Correcting, Updating or Removing Information</h3>
<p> </p><p>OurStory
users may access, modify, or remove any of their personal information
at any time by logging-in to their accounts and accessing My Profile.
When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the
unrevised information in our records. Deleted posts and email addresses
are deleted from our Service immediately. Email addresses for cancelled
accounts, however, are kept indefinitely to prevent the unauthorized
future opening of a user account using such an email address.</p>
<br><p> </p><p>You
may request deletion of your OurStory account by logging-in to your
account and accessing Account Info. Please note that some information
may remain in our records, such as on back-up tapes, after deletion of
your account.</p>
<br><p> </p><h3>Changes in Our Privacy Statement</h3>
<p></p><p>Lifescape
may amend this Privacy Statement at any time, at our sole discretion.
Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Statement
in effect at the time such information is used. If we change this
Privacy Statement, we will post those changes on the Site so users are
always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under
what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we make material changes
to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a
notice on our home page.</p>
<br><p> </p><h3>Invite a Friend</h3>
<p></p><p>If
a user elects to invite a friend to use the Site, we ask them for the
friend's email address. Lifescape will automatically send the friend an
email inviting them to join the Site. Lifescape stores this email
address for the purpose of automatically adding the recipient to the
"friends list" of the user sending the invitation. Lifescape does not
sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication
besides these one time invitations. The friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ourstory.com">support@ourstory.com</a> to request the removal of this information from our database</p>
<br><p></p><h3>Publicly Viewable Posts and Photos</h3>
<p> </p><p>Please
keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal
information online in public view on the Site (including, without
limitation, classifying any posting on the Site as publicly viewable),
that information can be collected and used by others. If you choose to
upload a photo to your Profile Page, this photo is publicly viewable.
By posting personal information online in public view, you may receive
unsolicited messages from other parties. </p>
<br><p></p><h3>Security</h3>
<p> </p><p>Your
OurStory account is password-protected. You need to work to protect
against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by
logging-off once you have finished using a shared computer. We use
industry standard measures, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
software, to protect your information both during transmission and once
we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method
of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we
strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal
information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We limit access
to your information to those employees who need access to perform their
job functions, such as our customer service personnel. All of our
employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices. If
you have any questions about the Site's security, please contact us.</p>
<br><p></p><h3>Third Party Advertising</h3>
<p></p><p>The
ads appearing on the Site are delivered to users by our Web advertising
partners. Our Web advertising partners may use cookies. Doing this
