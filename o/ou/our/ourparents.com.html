<h1>RealPage, Inc. Corporate Privacy Policy</h1>

<div id="breadcrumbs">
<a href="/">Home</a>
 &gt; <b class="active">OurParents Privacy Policy</b>
</div>
<p>
RealPage, Inc. (“RealPage”) is committed to providing our product and service users with clear and concise information regarding our privacy policy and practices. This Privacy Policy describes in detail our policy and practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of user information by the
<a href="http://www.realpage.com/company/realpage-company-info" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.realpage.com']);" target="_blank">RealPage family of companies, products, and services.</a>
By accessing our websites or utilizing our products and services, you consent to the information collection and handling practices outlined in this policy.
</p>
<h3>Information Collection</h3>
<p>RealPage may collect various types of information, both personal and anonymous, through our products, services, and websites. The information is gathered from your usage of our products and services, as well as from your entry of information on our websites. This collected information consists of two basic types of data: 1) personal information and 2) non-personal information.</p>
<p>Personal information is information that can be used to uniquely identify you as an individual or contact you directly. This may include contact information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address. For certain financial, health, or credit-based products and services, personal information may also include sensitive data such as payment data, credit records, social security numbers, date of birth, and account numbers. Personal information is only collected based upon your choice to provide it to RealPage through our products, services, and websites. You have the option to choose not to provide personal information to us; however, the lack of such personal information will typically prevent RealPage from providing the requested products or services to you.</p>
<p>Non-personal information is general information that does not permit direct association with you as an individual. When you browse RealPage websites, we may automatically collect non-personal information such as your IP address, device information, browser, internet connection speed, past web pages visited, and your link selections on our various website pages. This information may be used to: (1) manage and protect our websites, products, services, and users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; and (2) help us research, develop, and improve our websites, products, and services. This type of information may also be aggregated or otherwise rendered anonymous for business and marketing uses by us or by third parties.</p>
<h3>Information Disclosure</h3>
<p>Except as explained in this Privacy Policy, RealPage does not sell, license, or share our users’ information outside the RealPage family of companies without the consent and authorization of the user whose information will be shared.</p>
<p>
We may share your information within the
<a href="http://www.realpage.com/company/realpage-company-info" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.realpage.com']);" target="_blank">RealPage family of companies, products, and services</a>
for operational and marketing purposes. The RealPage companies that access your information will do so in conformity with the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Sharing this information allows RealPage to provide you with the best customer service experience possible, provide you with the services you have ordered or requested, and notify you of the latest information regarding new or enhanced products, services, and promotions. RealPage may periodically send offers, promotions, and updates regarding RealPage products and services to current and potential users via e-mail. Every marketing e-mail RealPage sends contains instructions and procedures allowing you to opt out of additional marketing e-mails for that product or service.
</p>
<p>In some circumstances, we use third-party companies, agents, and contractors to perform services on our behalf, such as website optimization, email distribution, processing credit card transactions, infrastructure and IT services, background screening, and other data processing or handling functions. In the course of engaging these third party services, RealPage only shares your information to the extent reasonably necessary for the third party to perform the services on our behalf. We do not permit these third parties to use or disclose your personal information except for the purpose of providing the services we request of them. However, please note that RealPage does not maintain control over the privacy policies and practices of any third party companies, agents, or contractors.</p>
<p>RealPage also reserves the right to disclose user information if we reasonably believe that such disclosure is necessary to (1) satisfy any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, (2) to respond to a governmental request, (3) enforce RealPage Terms of Use or investigate potential violations thereof, (4) to protect against fraudulent, malicious, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of RealPage products, services, and websites, or (5) to protect our rights or property, or the safety or security of our customers, employees or data.</p>
<p>If RealPage enters into any business transition, restructuring, merger, sale, or other transferring of assets, we reserve the right to transfer user information, including all personal information, as part of or in connection with the transaction.</p>

These linked websites are operated by unaffiliated third parties that have separate and independent privacy statements, terms of use, and related notices or disclosures regarding information handling practices. Third party advertisers may also utilize cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect information regarding your website interactions and activities. These third party technologies may be utilized by those entities to provided targeted advertising and web links based upon your activities and preferences. If you choose to interact with specific advertisers who advertise on our sites, the information you provide to them is subject to the conditions of their specific privacy policies and in no way covered by the practices described in this policy.
