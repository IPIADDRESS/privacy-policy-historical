</p>

<p>
In addition, OurProperty.co.uk contains links to other sites, advertisers and

collected from or about you by any third party after you have left the 
OurProperty.co.uk website.
</p>

<p>
The data collection and usage practices of any third party linked to

assumes no liability and is not responsible for any practices of such third 
party web sites, including their privacy practices or content.
</p>

<h5>Cookies</h5>


<p>
OurProperty.co.uk uses cookies to store and collect information about your usage 
of the OurProperty.co.uk website, and affiliate web sites. Cookies are small 
pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard 
drive and that send the information stored in them back to our web server when 
OurProperty.co.uk web pages are accessed.
</p>

<p>
Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do 
enable us to load your personal settings and preferences information. Most web 
browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but contain an option for you 
to turn off the cookie acceptance if you prefer. If you turn off your cookie 
acceptance, you may not be able to sign on to OurProperty.co.uk or access our 
services.
</p>

<p>
Additional system information we may gather includes time, type of web browser 
being used, the operating system/platform, your IP address, the web site from 
which you link to OurProperty.co.uk, and CPU speed. We also take note of whether 
and how you use the information and services that we provide by recording site 
traffic patterns, user clickstreams and by maintaining log files of users' 
access to site files.
</p>



<h5>How is your information used?</h5>

<p>
Your information will never be shared with any third party. The information we gather 
from you will only be used by Our Property in order to provide you with access to our products, 
services and information that we believe will interest you. OurProperty.co.uk may also use 
information about our users in statistical aggregate form. This is not personal information but
simply refers to information such as sign up figure, traffic patterns and site user trends.

<h5>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of 
the information?</h5>

You can change, modify or delete information previously provided by logging into

<h5>How is customer information protected?</h5>

<p>
We use a secure server to protect all the information you provide us with. All 
information you enter is encrypted by the server's software, SSL (Secure Socket 
Layers). It is then not decrypted until it reaches our server. The locked 
padlock symbol in the bottom left hand corner of your browser tells you our site 
is secure. When this is displayed it means that you can safely send private 
information through our site. Our secure pages will not display a 'security 
alert' message. This means that our pages are secure and that your information 
is safe with us. Also, we protect our internal information from the Internet by 
using a Firewall (security software) on our server.
