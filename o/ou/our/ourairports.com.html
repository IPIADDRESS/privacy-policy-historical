<h1>About OurAirports</h1>

<p><strong>OurAirports</strong> is a free site where visitors can
explore the world's airports, read other people's comments, and leave
their own.  The <a href="/help/">help pages</a> have information to
help you get started.</p>

<p>The site is dedicated to both
<strong>passengers</strong> and <strong>pilots</strong>.
You can create your own, personal map of the airports
you've visited and share that map with other people.  You
can find the closest airports to your home airport, and
find the ones that you haven't visited yet. Find every
airport in a country or region. Or go to <a href="/big-map.html">The Big Map</a> and zoom into to any
spot in the world to see where the airports are.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>OurAirports does not treat your personal information as a
commodity: that means that we don't buy it, sell it, or use it to spam
you.  Still, privacy on the modern web is a tricky thing, and there
are some points that you should be aware of:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>OurAirports is a public site, and by "public", we mean
<strong>PUBLIC</strong>.  All content you explicitly submit to
OurAirports through forms <em>aside from your password, email address,
and searches</em> is released into Public Domain and can be viewed by
anyone on the web, including search engines.</p>

<p>That means that your user name and description of yourself, the
airports you've flagged as visited, every comment you leave, every
message you send to another member, every correction you make to
airport data, and your home airport (if you name it) are <em>out
there</em>, on the web.  This is an open-data web site, after all, and
we don't believe that "open" means "we can benefit from it, but we'll
hide it from everyone else".</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Like nearly every site on the web, we log network activity.  That
means that we know the Internet address that you connected from and,
most of the time, the URL of the web page that referred you to us.  If
you're logged in, we also have your login name, and any information
associated with it.</p>

<p>We don't do anything evil with all that network-level information
(in fact, we don't do anything good either, because this is a
hobby/volunteer site, and no one has time to look at server logs).
You should know, however, that any intermediary on the web (such as a
firewall or proxy) that you connect through can <em>also</em> get this
information.</p>

<p>That means that your Internet service provider probably has that
information as well, and we can't help what they do with it (knowing
hotels, phone companies, big soul-less employers, and universities,
they could well be doing evil things). If you're using open WiFi in an
airport or coffee shop, everyone there can also see this information
if they install some simple sniffing software on their laptops.  If
you don't want intermediaries to see what you're doing (e.g. you're
trying to get your family out of a dangerous country, and looking for
the best exit airport), you can connect to all web sites via a Virtual
Private Network (VPN), which will hide your web activity from anyone
trying to snoop on it.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>If (and only if) you ask us to, OurAirports uses the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C_Geolocation_API">W3C
Geolocation API</a></strong> to obtain your current location from your
web browser and prefill the latitude and longitude into the
OurAirports search box.</p>

<p>We can't get your location information unless you tell your
browser/smartphone that we're allowed to, and even then, we use it
only when you explicitly click on a link (<em>not</em> every time you
visit a page on the site).  The information goes back to us as a
search request that indistinguishable from if you typed the latitude
and longitude manually. We do not store your location in any way,
except as it might appear in search requests, and we don't know if the
search requests are your current location, or just a location you're
interested in.  See below, however, for other possible privacy issues
outside our control.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>The maps in OurAirports are provided through the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps#Google_Maps_API">Google
Maps API</a></strong>.  While OurAirports supplies some of the text
and icons in the map, Google controls the part of the screen where the
map appears, communicating directly with your browser, so OurAirports
has no control over cookies or other information that may flow back
and forth between your browser and Google.</p>

<p>As a result, Google can potentially track every airport or other
map-related page you visit in OurAirports.  To learn more, please read
<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html">Google's
privacy policy</a>.  If you would prefer a version of OurAirports
without maps, please visit our simple mobile site at <a href="http://ourairports.mobi/">ourairports.mobi</a>.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>The ads that appear on the right side of many OurAirports screens
are provided by the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsense">Google AdSense
program</a></strong>.  As of July 2011, our revenue from ads is
approximately $150-250/month, which covers hosting costs for the site,
but little or none of the effort spent developing and maintaining it
(in a good month, what's left over after hosting pays for a few visits
to a good coffee shop).  Nobody's job depends on this ad revenue, so
please don't feel guilty if you choose to block these ads using an
ad-filtering browser add-on like <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adblock_Plus">Adblock Plus</a>.</p>

<p>Like much of the web, OurAirports also uses <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_analytics">Google
Analytics</a></strong> to collect anonymized information about how
much traffic the web site gets, how people use it, and the parts of
the world those people come from.  If you would like to opt out from
having Google Analytics collect information on the web sites you visit
(not just OurAirports), Google provides an <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Opt-out browser
add-on</a>.  There are also third-party add-ons to various browsers to
block analytics.</p>

<p>The privacy cautions that apply to the maps embedded on OurAirports
pages also apply to the ads and analytics.  On all sites that display
Google ads and use Google Analytics, Google is able to collect a large
amount of private information, including what town or city you're
browsing from, what kind of browser you're using, and even the search
string you used to reach a site.  All of this information flows
directly to Google from your browser, and is again, outside the
control of OurAirports, but we wanted you to be aware of it.  Again,
to learn more, please read <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html">Google's
privacy policy</a>.</p>
