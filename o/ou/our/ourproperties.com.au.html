The <em>Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988</em> sets out a number of principles concerning the protection of your personal information.&nbsp; By using the web site of OurProperties you agree to the privacy statement set out below. This privacy statement sets out important information about privacy protections which we extend to your personal information relating to personal information that you provide to us through OurProperties.&nbsp; The privacy statement should be reviewed periodically to ensure you are updated on any changes.</p>
<p><strong><em>How is your personal information collected and used?</em> </strong></p>
<p>When you contact us requesting information regarding our services, you may be asked for some personal information, such as your name and contact details. If you make a request by email we may retain this information for further communication. We only collect information about you which we need to process your enquiry, request or application, to advise you of new services/events and to satisfy legal requirements. We will also use this information for purposes such as correspondence, special events or to participate in client surveys. In conjunction with our multi-lingual websites, there may be circumstances in which we need to transfer personal information outside Australia. If we do so, we will ensure that the organisation to which the information is transferred will be subject to binding privacy obligations otherwise we will seek to obtain your consent.</p>
<p><em><strong>Data quality </strong></em></p>
<p>We regularly monitor data and document employee procedures to help ensure that your personal information is accurate and up to date. In addition, we demand high standards of quality from others who provide us with information about prospective clients and other services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Data security</em> </strong></p>
<p>Whenever we handle your personal information, access is limited to those who are authorised to use it to do their jobs and to deliver our services to you. Personal information is protected using a range of security processes.</p>
<p>We will keep information for as long as it is necessary to continue to provide the services you have requested or to meet our legal and regulatory obligations with respect to maintenance of property records and we will destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if it is no longer required.</p>
<p><strong><em>Access and correction</em> </strong></p>
<p>You can contact our Privacy Officer at any time if you would like details of any personal information we may hold about you or if you would like us to correct or amend it. Depending on the nature of your request, we may ask you to complete a personal data access form. In some cases, we may charge you a service fee for providing this information, but we will inform you of this at the time. Please contact:</p>
<p>The Privacy Officer<br>
Email: privacy@ourproperties.com.au</p>
<p><em><strong>Website data processing and analysis</strong></em></p>
<p>If you log onto the website and read or download information our Internet Service Provider/Hosting Provider, will record your server address, domain name, the date and time of your visit to our website, the pages viewed and the information downloaded. This information is used for statistical and website development purposes only.</p>
<p>We can determine the number of times that you have visited our website, the date of last visit, if you have updated your details/interests, and if you have clicked on the hyperlink contained on emails that have been sent to you.&nbsp; The information collected will be used to send you emails when content relevant to your areas of interest are added to the website.</p>
<p>We can determine if you emailed any articles of interest to a friend using our ‘email a friend’ functionality, and if your friend has clicked on the hyperlink contained on the email that was sent by you.&nbsp; We record the email addresses of these recipients which may be used for our own marketing purposes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Disclosure of personal information</em> </strong></p>
<p>YBI Group Holdings Pty Ltd and its related companies are committed to protecting the personal information of our clients. This section explains how we share your personal information with others.</p>
<p><strong><em>Business partners</em></strong></p>
<p>We may send you information by direct marketing methods (eg mail, fax, phone, email) about programs and services offered by our business partners. When we do this we maintain control over your personal information, which is not disclosed to our business partners, unless you have expressly authorised us to do so or you respond to their offer.</p>
<p><strong><em>Service Providers</em></strong></p>
<p>In certain circumstances we contract other companies to provide services for us. Examples of this include mail houses and couriers. We provide them only such information about you that they require to perform their services, and we impose strict requirements of security and confidentiality on them in how they handle your personal information. They are not permitted to use information about you for any purpose, except to perform the services we have contracted them to provide.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other information disclosure</em></strong></p>
<p>In all other cases we will not disclose your personal information unless you have been previously informed or have authorised use to do so, or if we are required to do so by law or where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting fraud or criminal activity or where there is a reasonable belief that it is necessary to lessen a serious or imminent threat to the life or health of any person.</p>
<p><em><strong>If you do not want to receive direct marketing communications </strong></em></p>
<p>If you want to “opt out” of receiving direct marketing communications, all you need to do is let us know. All mail, fax or email offers you receive from us will let you know how to “opt out” from receiving further such communications. You can do this at any time by contacting:</p>
