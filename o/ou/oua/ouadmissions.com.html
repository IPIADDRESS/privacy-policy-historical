        Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        We value the trust you place in us. That's why we insist upon the highest standards
        for secure transactions and applicant information privacy. Please read the following
        statement to learn about our information gathering and dissemination practices.
    </p>

        sure you are aware of any changes, <strong>please review this policy periodically.</strong></p>
    <p>
        <strong>1. PAYMENT SECURITY</strong></p>
    <p>
        Our site has stringent security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and

        fraud and other criminal activity, enforce our terms and conditions, and as otherwise
        described to you at the time of collection.</p>

        faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to court orders,
        or other legal process. We may disclose personal information to law enforcement
