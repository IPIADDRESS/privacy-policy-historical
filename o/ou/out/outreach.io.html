					<h3>Some Notes On Our Relationship</h3>
					<p>This Privacy Statement applies to "<a href="http://www.outreach.io">www.outreach.io</a>" and the customer engagement platform service at <a href="http://accounts.outreach.io">accounts.outreach.io</a> ("Outreach Service" or "the Service"), which are owned and operated by Outreach Corporation (Outreach). At Outreach, we are committed to maintaining the confidentiality and security of any personal information about our users. Your privacy is always at the top of our priorities, and we are focused on protecting it from unauthorized access.<br></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy supplements our End User License Agreement (EULA)/<a href="https://www.outreach.io/terms">Terms of Service</a> and spells out how we collect, use, and disclose of information from or about you through our website <a href="http://www.outreach.io">www.outreach.io</a> and the Outreach Service. Users can access the Outreach Service via our website <a href="http://www.outreach.io">www.outreach.io</a>, <a href="http://accounts.outreach.io">accounts.outreach.io</a>, applications on Devices, APIs, and third-parties. A "Device" is any device used to access the Outreach Service, including without limitation a computer, mobile phone, tablet, or other electronic device. By using our Service, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Outreach client ("Client") has engaged Outreach.</p>
<p>Outreach participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks. Outreach is committed to subjecting all personal data received from the Swiss Confederation (Switzerland) and European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the respective Privacy Shield Frameworks, to the Frameworksâ applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, visit the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">U.S. Department of Commerceâs Privacy Shield program site</a>.
 </p>
<p>Outreach is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Outreach complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU or Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>
<p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Outreach is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Outreach may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a>.</p>
<p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Privacy Shield website</a>, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p>

					<h3>The Information We Collect and Store</h3>
					<p>Outreach employees are prohibited from viewing the content of the data you import into your Outreach account, except as provided in this Privacy Policy. Of course, in the case that you request our help to resolve your support issues relating to that data, and only after receiving your permission, Outreach employees may access the relevant data.<br></p>
<p>We may collect and store the following information when running the Outreach Service:</p>
<p>Information You provide. When you register for an account, we collect some personal information, such as your name, phone number, email address, and home and/or business postal addresses. You may also ask us to import your contacts and email history by giving us access to your third party services (for example, your email account) or to use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services. In fact, in order to use our Service, you must link a third party email account to your Outreach account. We then import, create, and update versions of your address book and emails for you to access in Outreach. You will also have the option to import and update versions of your calendar, social media contacts, and mobile phone call history, and you can later choose to upload files to, or provide comments through, Outreach. When you invite others to join Outreach by using the Service, we send them an email for that invitation at the email addresses assigned to them in your address book.</p>

					<h3>Data Retention</h3>
					<p>Outreach will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients and our Clients' customer data for as long as needed to provide services to our Client.

Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request. Please note, that Outreach may retain your personal data for longer where there is a legal obligation, contractual, or legitimate interest, unless these interests are overridden by the individualâs fundamental rights; in those cases data will be removed once it is no longer needed for those purposes.
