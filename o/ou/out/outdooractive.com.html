This is a unique but non-personalized and non-permanent identification number for a particular device provided by iOS. The data collected through the IDFA will not be linked to any other device-related information. The IDFA is used by us to provide you with personalized advertising and to evaluate your use. If you enable 'no ad tracking' in the iOS setting under 'Privacy'-'Advertising', we are only able to take the following actions: Measure your interaction with banners by counting the number of times a banner is displayed without being clicked on ('frequency capping') and evaluate the click- through rate, unique user detection, unique user detection, security measures, fraud prevention and troubleshooting. You can delete the IDFA ('reset Advertising ID') at any time in the device settings, creating then a new IDFA that is not merged with the previously collected data. We would like to make you aware that restricting the use of the IDFA may make you unable to use all of the features of the app.</p> <p>(f) Collection of your location data</p> <p>(aa)Our products include so-called Location Based Services, with which we offer specific services that are tailored to your location. You are only able to use these functions after agreeing via a pop-up that we can anonymously collect both your data using GPS and your IP address for the purposes of providing a service. You can permit or disable this function within the settings of the app or your operating system at any point by calling up the settings in (...)</p> <p>Your location will be regularly relayed to us following your confirmation, at which point we will only use your last recorded location and delete previous notifications relating to your location. When the location survey is active, your smartphone indicates that the data is being processed via a compass icon in the upper bar.</p> <p>(bb)For the purposes of advertising, market research and demand-oriented design of the offer, we create user profiles using pseudonyms. These data are not combined with other personal data. You can object to this by clicking on the corresponding button in the app settings.

We are keen to show you advertisements that are of interest to you, both to improve your user experience and to fairly calculate advertising costs.</p> <p>(2) This advertising material is delivered by Google via so-called 'ad servers'. For this purpose we use Ad Server Cookies, which can be used to measure certain indicators of performance such as teasers or the number of clicks made by users. If you access our website through a Google advertisement, Google Adwords stores a cookie on your PC. These cookies are usually no longer valid after 30 days and are not intended to identify you personally. Generally the unique cookie ID, number of ad impressions per placement (Frequency), last impression (relevant for post-view conversions) and opt-out information (denoting that the user no longer wishes to be targeted) are usually stored as values for analysis in respect of this cookie.</p> <p>(3) These cookies enable Google to recognize your internet browser. If a user visits certain pages of an Adwords customer's website and the cookie stored on their computer has not yet expired, Google and the customer may recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to that page. Each Adwords customer is assigned a different cookie. Therefore, Cookies cannot be tracked via the websites of Adwords customers. We ourselves do not collect and process any personal data in the advertising process already mentioned. We receive only statistical analysis provided by Google. Using this data, we can identify which types of advertising were particularly effective. We do not receive any further data from the use of the advertising and we cannot identify individual users on the basis of this information.</p> <p>(4) Because of the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Google server.
