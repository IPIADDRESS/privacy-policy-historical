        <p><strong>Information You Provide</strong></p>

        Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of registering
        for an account or updating your account. This information may include, for
        example, name, email address, zip code, country, and related demographic

        required for you to register for the account, while some may be optional.</p>

        collect information about the lists you create and the content you include
        on these lists.</p>

        newsletters from time to time on our Service. If you sign up to receive a
        newsletter from us, we collect your email address.</p>
        <p>5. <strong>Integrated Services: </strong>You may be given the option
        to access or register for the Service through the use of your user names
        and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each an “<strong>Integrated
        Service</strong>”), such as through the use of your Facebook credentials
        through Facebook Connect or your Google credentials through Google+. By
        doing this, you authorize us to access and store the credentials you
        provide, such as your name, email address(es), age range, gender, country,
        profile picture, language, friend list and other information that the
        Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in
        accordance with this Policy. You should check your Integrated Service
        privacy settings to understand and change the information sent to us
        through the Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Services
        terms and privacy policies carefully before using their services and
        connecting to our Service.</p>
        <p>6. <strong>Correspondence: </strong>If you contact us by email, using a contact form
        on the Service, or by mail, fax, or other means, we collect the
        information contained within, and associated with, your correspondence.</p>
        <p>7. <strong>Interactive Features: </strong>Our Service may contain
        interactive functionality that allows you to engage with other users on
        the Service, share your lists and other content (the “<strong>User Materials</strong>”),
        participate in surveys, and otherwise to interact with the Service and
        with other users. If you use any interactive functionality on our Service
        that requests or permits you to provide us with Personal Information
        (including, for example, any services that allow you to post User
        Materials on any of our Service), we collect the information that you
        provide to us in the course of using these interactive features.
        </p>
        <p>8. <strong>Contests and Sweepstakes: </strong>We or our advertisers and
        other business partners may conduct or sponsor special contests,
        sweepstakes, and other promotions that users may enter or otherwise
        participate in on our Service. Certain of these promotions may be
        co-branded with one of our advertisers or other business partners. In
        these instances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur
        directly by the third-party partner on its website or other online service
        and may be shared with us. The promotion will state the privacy policy or
        policies governing the collection of such Personal Information.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Information We Receive From Your Use of Our Services</strong></p>

        parties (“<strong>Third-Party Services</strong>”), including, for example, Google
        Analytics, may set cookies or other technologies on your hard drive to collect
        non-personally identifiable information about your use of the Service in order
        to assist us in understanding our users activities on the Services. We do not
        have access to, or control over, the actions of Third-Party Services. Each
        provider of Third-Party Services uses information that it collects in
        accordance with its own privacy policies.</p>

        device such as your country, latitude, longitude and what stores, retailers or
        other merchants are physically near the location of your mobile device. Your
        devices operating system may give you the option of enabling or disabling the
        collection of certain location information at any time through your mobile

        <p><strong>Disclosure of Your Information</strong></p>

        circumstances:</p>

        <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
        <p>We engage other companies and individuals to perform certain services and functions on our behalf.
        For example, we may engage third parties to send email and postal mail, analyze data, provide
        marketing services, process applications, provide search results and links (including paid listings and links),
        and provide customer service. We contractually obligate these service providers to access and use the Personal
        Information we make available to them only as needed to perform their functions and for no other purposes.</p>

        <p><strong>Advertising Partners</strong></p>

        provide and tailor deals, advertisements and content as part of the Service.
        In addition, we may disclose to our advertising partners information regarding
        your interaction with content provided by these advertising partners, for
        example, the number of times you view and click on such deals, advertisements
        and content.</p>

        <p><strong>Emailing and Sharing Lists</strong></p>
        <p>Some features on our Service may allow you to upload, post, or otherwise transmit User Materials to other
        people.  For example, you may be able to email your lists or share your lists
        with other users. Please be aware that any Personal Information that you
        include within any such User Materials will be made available to those people
        that you designate, as well as our third party advertising partners, as
        described above. You include Personal Information in User Materials at your
        sole risk. Even after information posted on the Service is removed, those
        people with whom you have shared the information may have copied or stored such
        information.</p>

        <p><strong>Business Transfers</strong></p>
        <p>Information about our users, including Personal Information, may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to
        an acquirer, or successor or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt
        financing, sale of Capigami assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the
        event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which Personal
        Information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business
        assets.</p>

        <p><strong>To Protect our Interests</strong></p>
        <p>We also disclose Personal Information if we believe that doing so is legally required, or is in our
        interest to protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not
        limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or property of
        others, or otherwise to help protect the safety or security of our Service and
        other users of the Service.</p>


        <p><strong>Choice</strong></p>
        <p>If you receive promotional emails from us, you may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions
        contained within the email. You may also opt-out from receiving promotional emails
        from us by sending your request to us by email at privacy@capigami.com or by
        writing to us at the address given at the end of this policy.</p>
        <p>Please be aware that if you opt-out
        of receiving promotional emails from us, it may take up to ten business days
        for us to process your opt-out request, and you may receive promotional emails
        from us during that period. Additionally, even after you opt-out from receiving
        promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative
        messages from us regarding our Service.</p>

        <p><strong>Access</strong></p>
        <p>If we offer the ability to create user accounts on our Service, you may have the ability to access and update
        certain Personal Information that you provide to us by logging in to your
        account and accessing your account settings. If you wish to access or amend any
        other Personal Information we hold about you, you may contact us at privacy@capigami.com.</p>

        <p>If you request that we delete your account on any of our Service (via a user settings page, by email, or
        otherwise), we will do so within a reasonable period of time, but we may need
        to retain some of your information in order to satisfy our legal obligations,
        or where we reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.</p>

        <p><strong>Links</strong></p>

        <p>The Service may contain links to other websites, products, or services that we do
        not own or operate. For example, the Service may contain links to third-party
        merchants from which you may receive deals through the Service. If you choose
        to visit or use any Third-Party Sites or products or services available on or
        through such Third-Party Sites, please be aware that this Policy will not apply
        to your activities or any information you disclose while using those
        Third-Party Sites or any products or services available on or through such
        Third-Party Sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third-Party Sites or any
        products or services on or through them. Additionally, please be aware that the
        Service may contain links to websites and services that we operate but that are
        governed by different privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully review
        the privacy policies applicable to any website or service you visit other than
        the Service before providing any Personal Information on them.</p>

                <h4>Children</h4>
        <p>Children's safety is important to us, and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active interest in the
        online activities of their children. Our Service is not directed to children
        under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from
        children under the age of 13 without obtaining parental consent. If we learn
        that we have collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13 on
        our Service, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you
        believe that we may have collected any such Personal Information on our
        Service, please notify us at privacy@capigami.com.</p>

        <h4>International Visitors</h4>
        <p>Our servers and data centers are
        located in the United States. If you choose to use the Service from outside the
        U.S., then you should know that you are transferring your Personal Information
        outside of your region and into the U.S. for storage and processing. By
        providing your Personal Information to us through your use of the Service, you
        agree to that transfer, storage, and processing in the U.S. Also, we may
        transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection
        with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating
        the Service. You should know that each region can have its own privacy and data
        security laws, some of which may be less stringent as compared to those of your
        own region.</p>

        <h4>Security</h4>
        <p>We
        use security measures to help protect information from accidental loss,
        disclosure, misuse, and destruction. These measures may include regular review
        of our system logs, data encryption, and security software on our networks and
        servers. Please be aware, however, that no data security measures can be
        guaranteed to be completely effective. Consequently, we cannot ensure or
        warrant the security of any information that you provide to us. You transmit
        information to us at your own risk.</p>

        <h4>Updates to this Policy</h4>
        <p>We may occasionally update this
        Policy. When we do, we will also revise the “last updated” date at the
        beginning of the Policy. Your continued use of our Service after such changes
        will be subject to the then-current policy. If we change this Policy in a
        manner that is materially less restrictive of our use or disclosure of your
        Personal Information, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the change
        and to obtain your consent prior to applying the change to any Personal
        Information that we collected from you prior to the date the change becomes
        effective. We encourage you to periodically review this Policy to stay informed
        about how we collect, use, and disclose information.</p>
