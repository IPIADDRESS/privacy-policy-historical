<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Outside.in knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the Outside.in website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers Outside.in's treatment of personal information that Outside.in gathers when you are on the Outside.in website and when you use Outside.in Service.</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Outside.in does not own or control, or to individuals that Outside.in does not employ or manage.</p>
<h3>What Personal Information About Users Does Outside.in Collect?</h3>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience. We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website. We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with the purpose for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by you. We collect the following types of information from our users:</p>
<h4>1. Information You Provide to Us:</h4>
<p>We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.</p>
<h4>2. Automatic Information:</h4>
<p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Outside.in automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Outside.in cookie information, and the page you requested. Outside.in uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.</p>
<h3>What About Cookies?</h3>
<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Outside.in cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.</p>
<p>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We strongly recommend, however, that you leave the cookies activated because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Outside.in's most attractive features.</p>
<p>Some of our business partners and third party vendors use cookies on our website. Google is one such third party vendor.</p>
<p>Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.</p>
<p>Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to users based on their visits to sites on the Internet include the Outside.in website.</p>
<p>Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.</p>
<p>However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>
<p>

<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads">Google Advertising and Privacy</a>.
</p>
<h3>Will Outside.in Share Any of the Information it Receives?</h3>
<p>Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone. We share your personal information only as described below.</p>
<h5>Outside.in Personnel:</h5>
<p>Outside.in personnel (including, for the avoidance of doubt, consultants and/or contractors) may have access to user information while carrying out their duties in the normal course of Outside.in business.</p>
<h5>Business Transfers:</h5>
<p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Outside.in, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred.</p>
<h5>Protection of Outside.in and Others:</h5>
<p>We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Outside.in, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<h5>With Your Consent:</h5>
<p>Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, and you will be able to prevent the sharing of this information by opting out.</p>
<h5>Is Information About Me Secure?</h5>
<p>Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.</p>
<h3>What Choices Do I Have?</h3>
<p>As explained earlier, the "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. Please note, however, that if your browser does not accept cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of some of our attractive features.</p>
<h3>Can Children Use the Outside.in Web Site?</h3>
<p>Yes, no registration is required to browse the Outside.in website. Outside.in does not knowingly collect information from children.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Outside.in may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, at its sole discretion. If there are any significant changes to how we handle personal information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Outside.in website. Your continued use of Outside.in will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions made to the Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>Conditions of Use</h3>
<p>If you decide to visit the Outside.in website, your visit and any possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of California state law.</p>
<p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<h3>Effective Date of this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of February 9, 2011</p>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
