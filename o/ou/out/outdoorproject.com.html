<p>We will not share your personal information outside of Outdoor Project unless you have consented to having your personal information shared with a company that is not affiliated with us. If we do share your personal information with another company not affiliated with us, that information is subject to that company’s privacy policies. However, we may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our Terms of Use or when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.</p>

<p>From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys, contests or sweepstakes (together, “Promotions”) through the Site. If you decide to participate, we will request some personal information from you. Participation in these Promotions is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We use this information to administer your participation in each Promotion.</p>
<p>Social Sharing. The Site gives you the option to share information with certain social networking services (including but not limited to Twitter and Facebook). When you choose to share information about your activities on Outdoor Project with social networking services, those services may make that information visible to their users in accordance with applicable law, their data use policies, and your privacy settings for those social networking services. <br>

<p>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. Outdoor Project cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Outdoor Project or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity. </p><br>
Changing or Deleting Your Information. All Members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their Account by contacting us or via the “My Profile” section of the Site.
