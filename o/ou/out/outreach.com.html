			Policy.</span>

		<span>References to “personal information” in this Privacy Policy are equivalent to “personal data” governed by European Union

		<b>Controller</b>

						interests. &nbsp;We do not use your personal information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact
						on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>To comply with
						<g class="gr_ gr_293 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="293" data-gr-id="293">law</g>. &nbsp;Processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligations.</span>

		<b>Use for new purposes</b>

		<b>Cross-Border Data Transfer</b>

		<span>Whenever we transfer your personal information out of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to countries not deemed by the
			European Commission to provide an adequate level of personal information protection, the transfer will be based on one

			where required by EU data protection legislation:</span>

		<ul>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span>Contracts approved by the European Commission that impose data protection obligations on the parties to the transfer.
						&nbsp;For further details, see European Commission Model contracts for the transfer of personal information to third countries.

				</li>
				<li>
					<span>For transfers to third parties in the United States, ensuring they comply with EU legal data transfer protections and
						the transfer complies with such legal requirements.</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>For transfers to third parties in the United States, ensuring they participate in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.</span>
