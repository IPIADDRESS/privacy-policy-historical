                <br>
                When you use our website, use our mobile applications or open an email from us, we may automatically collect information about you using tracking technology, including Internet Protocol Address (“IP Address”), a unique device or user identification, system and browser type, the referring address website, the content and domain pages that you access on our website or mobile applications, and the dates and times that you use our website or mobile applications.  We use technology, including cookies (a piece of data that is placed on your computer when you visit a website) to automatically collect certain information, as described above, that we then use for system administration and website maintenance, troubleshooting, and to identify you when you open our e-mail or visit our website through your computer or mobile device so we can enhance your online experience and make our advertising more relevant.

This information may be used to evaluate our online advertising campaigns or to tailor promotions and other marketing messages to you.<br>
                <br> 
                Some of these ads are online behavioral advertising and may contain cookies that allow monitoring of your response to our advertisements.
