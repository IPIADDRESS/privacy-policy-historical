			PLANETOUT PRIVACY STATEMENT
		</b>
	</font>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
	PlanetOut has created this privacy policy because we value our members and recognize their right to keep personal information private. This statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for all PlanetOut-managed sites, including PlanetOut on the World Wide Web and PlanetOut on America Online. PlanetOut feels very strongly that private information should remain private. We will never willfully disclose personally identifiable information about our users to any third party without first receiving that user’s permission.
	<font color="#cc0000">
		We'd like to hear your feedback about this statement. If you have comments or questions, please email us by 
		<a href="/action/">
			<font color="#cc0000">
				clicking here
			</font></a>
	</font>
	. We'll be refining this policy over the next several weeks, so your feedback is important. We've also asked 
	<a href="http://www.truste.org/" target="_blank">
		TRUSTe</a>
	, an independent, non-profit privacy initiative dedicated to building users' trust and confidence on the Internet, to certify out privacy statement.

	<b>
		PLANETOUT GATHERS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:
	</b>
	<b>
		</b></p><p><b>
		IP Address
		<br>
	</b>
	PlanetOut’s web servers and our feedback form on the web gather your IP address to help diagnose problems with our service, to administer our site, and to gather broad demographic information. Demographic information is gathered in aggregate only and cannot be traced to an individual user.
	</p>
	<b>
		</b><p><b>
		Cookies
		<br>
	</b>
	Our website sets cookies to keep track of the contents of your shopping basket, to deliver content specific to your interests, and to save your password and member name so that you don’t have to enter it each time you visit. A cookie is a small line of data that is stored on your hard drive. Some cookies are only stored for the duration of a single browser session; others persist across sessions. We only save your password and member name if you tell us to do so; your password is stored on your computer and transferred over the internet in an encrypted format. Keep in mind that anyone using your web browser can access PlanetOut as you if you choose to store your member name and password. PlanetOut’s web servers also set a session ID cookie that is used to allow our servers to deliver information you request (e.g., search results). Session IDs cannot be traced to an individual person or member name, and are analyzed only in aggregate. Members who do not want to receive cookies can instruct their web browsers to refuse them; be aware, however, that doing so may prevent certain parts of PlanetOut’s site from working (e.g., web chat). Other organizations which place advertising on PlanetOut sometimes have the ability to assign a different cookie to you in a process that we don’t not control. Unless you’ve saved your member name, cookies aren't useable for identifying individuals (your computer will be assigned a random number); neither PlanetOut nor advertisers will know who you are..
	</p>
	<b>
		</b><p><b>
		Registration Form
		<br>
	</b>
	Membership on PlanetOut is completely optional.. PlanetOut’s registration form requires users to give contact information (for example, an email address) and demographic information (e.g., ZIP code, age). We use this information to send members information about PlanetOut (e.g., a weekly newsletter); members may opt-out of receiving this information. This information may be used to tailor a member’s PlanetOut experience by delivering content specific to your interests. At times, PlanetOut may rent names, mailing and email addresses to carefully selected organizations. This information is rented on a single-use-only basis. Members may opt-out of these programs by selecting "don’t share my mailing address" and/or "don’t share my email address" on our registration form. Aggregate demographic information collected through the registration process is shared with advertisers and other partners. This aggregate information is not traceable to an individual user.
	</p>
	<b>
		</b><p><b>
		Order Forms
		<br>
	</b>
	When purchasing products or services on PlanetOut, you’re asked for credit card, billing and shipping information. This information is used to bill customers for goods and services purchased and to ship merchandise. Only billing vendors have access to financial information and only for the purpose of billing customers. At times, PlanetOut may refer customers to other websites to purchase products. Your activity on those sites is covered by the privacy policies on those sites.
	</p>
	<b>
		</b><p><b>
		Online Surveys
		<br>
	</b>
	At times, PlanetOut may run online surveys asking for specific contact or demographic information. These surveys are always optional. At times, PlanetOut may share both the results of, and individual entries in, surveys with the sponsors of the survey. Results of surveys may be shared with partners and advertisers on an aggregate basis.
	</p>
	<b>
		</b><p><b>
		Contests
		<br>
	</b>
	At times, PlanetOut may run contests on our site where we ask for contact or demographic information. These contests are always optional. At times, PlanetOut may share both the results of, and individual entries in, surveys with the sponsors of the survey. Results of contests may be shared with partners and advertisers on an aggregate basis.
	</p>
	<b>
		</b><p><b>
		Message Boards, Chat Rooms, and Community Tools
		<br>
	</b>
	PlanetOut provides many venues for member interaction and community, including message boards, chat rooms, online polls, and other tools. In some cases, use of such tools (e.g., chat rooms, message boards) may reveal a users member name or email address. The aggregate result of polls may be shared with on PlanetOut sites. Use of PlanetOut’s message boards, chat rooms, and other community tools is typically governed by specific policies. Look in the relevant portion of the PlanetOut site for a policy. It one exists, it will be posted there. Users may have the ability to publish certain personal information (e.g., chat profiles, web page links, content ratings) on the PlanetOut service. In all cases, users create this information by opting-in. Users who do not want this information to be publicly available should not use these optional features on PlanetOut.
	</p>
	<b>
		</b><p><b>
		Member Feedback
		<br>
	</b>
	PlanetOut stores feedback members send to us. This feedback is used to administer and refine the PlanetOut service, and, at times, may be shared with PlanetOut partners either in aggregate form or with specific identifying characteristics (e.g., email address, name) removed.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>
		OPT-OUT
	</b>
	</p><p>
	Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out or receiving communications for us and from our partners, affiliates and advertisers at the point where we request information about the visitor.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>
		OFF SITE LINKS
	</b>
	</p><p>
	PlanetOut provides links to other sites. PlanetOut is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these Web and America Online sites.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>
		PLANETOUT ON AMERICA ONLINE
	</b>
	</p><p>
	America Online collects information about the aggregate behavior of users on the America Online service, including within the America Online-native portions (that is, the portions of PlanetOut on America Online that aren’t served from PlanetOut’s own web servers) of PlanetOut on America Online. AOL does not collect information about individuals; it only stores the data in aggregate and only makes that information to PlanetOut in aggregate. You can obtain more information about AOL’s privacy practices at Keyword: Privacy on America Online.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>
		SYNDICATED PLANETOUT CONTENT
	</b>
	</p><p>
	PlanetOut syndicates its content to, and distributes its content through, other sites on the internet (for example, PlanetOut News is available through Yahoo! and Snap! Online). Your activity on these sites is covered by the privacy statement on the site in question.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>
		YOUR PRIVATE ONLINE COMMUNICATIONS
	</b>
	</p><p>
	PlanetOut believes that member’s private communications in chat rooms, email, and instant message-like conversations should remain confidential. PlanetOut does not read or disclose private communications unless ordered to do so through a valid legal mechanism such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, to protect the company's rights and property, or during emergencies when we believe physical safety is at risk. Please remember that what you write or post in public areas such as chat rooms and message boards is available to all PlanetOut members, and in many cases, other visitors to the PlanetOut site. Also, keep in mind that PlanetOut is not responsible for what other users may do with private communications you’ve had with them.
