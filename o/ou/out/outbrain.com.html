  Whenever you visit or interact with the Service,  Outbrain, as well as any third-party vendors and/or service providers, may  use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect  information about how the Service is accessed and used (“<strong>Usage Information</strong>”).  Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, an  estimate of your geographic location associated with your IP address, the page  served, the time, referring URLs and other information normally transmitted in  HTTP requests. This  statistical data provides us with information about the use of the Service,  such as how many visitors visit a specific page on which the Service is  installed, how long they stay on that page, the type of content on that page, which  hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on and how they generally engage with that  page. This information helps us  keep the Service fresh and interesting to our users and tailor content to each  visitor’s interests. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Outbrain  associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person (for example,  because you have registered for the Service), Outbrain treats it as “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” (i.e. information  that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally,  such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, or home address) and will  use it to provide you with more targeted recommendations.<br><br>
We  also automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“<strong>Device  Identifier</strong>”) for each computer, mobile device, technology or other device  (collectively, “<strong>Device</strong>”) you use to access the Service. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you  access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify each Device by its  Device Identifier.<br><br>
  Our Service uses several different technologies to collect  Usage Information, including Device Identifiers. These may include, without limitation:</p>
<p><a name="_DV_M76" id="_DV_M76"></a><strong><em>Cookies</em></strong>. Cookies are small text files placed on a  Device when the Device is used to visit the Service. We may place cookies or similar files on your  Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize  your experience while using the Service, including by better tailoring internal  recommendations and promoted content to your preferences over time. For  example, we may use your web browsing information to try to show you specific  recommendations and sponsored recommendations that we think will be of  particular interest to you. We also use cookies in order to keep you logged in  to the Service if you register with us. Cookies allow us to collect technical  and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on the Service  and pages visited. Cookies may include a Device Identifier along with  information about the particular type of content in which you have shown interest.
  Cookies also allow us to  select which content is most likely to appeal to you and display that content  while you are using the Service.<br><br> If you click on a link to one  of our promoted content recommendations, the customer sponsoring the promoted  link may place a cookie on your Device as well, in which case you will be  subject to their privacy policy. Please note that you are subject to the  privacy policies of each site you visit - if Outbrain is installed on that  site, you are subject both to this Privacy Policy and the policy of the web  site owner. As further explained in the section of this Privacy Policy entitled <a name="Eight" href="#Eight"><strong><u>OTHER SITES</u></strong></a>,  if you click on  an Outbrain link to visit a site where the Service is not installed, you are  subject only to that site’s privacy policy while visiting that site, and not to this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
  You can find more information about the individual  cookies most relevant to your use of the service, and the purposes for which we use them in our Cookie Glossary <a href="http://www.outbrain.com/legal/cookies/">here</a>. <br><br>
  If you would prefer not to  accept cookies, you can do this by activating the setting on your browser that  allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use  your browser settings to block all cookies, please be aware that some functions  and features of the Service may not work properly because we may not be able to  recognize and associate you with your Outbrain account. In addition, we may not  be able to tailor our recommendations as well as we would be able to if you had  not blocked the cookies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pixel tags</em></strong>. A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image,  sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an  email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed. In addition, a  pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.</p>
<p><strong>Information You  Provide To Us</strong><br>
  In  addition to the information we collect automatically, we may ask you to provide  Personal Information when you sign up for the Service or otherwise communicate or interact with us. We may also ask  you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic  information (gender, zip code, age, etc.) or certain information about your  preferences and interests. If we combine  demographic or other information we collect about you with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information. If you apply to become a customer of  Outbrain, we may request additional information from you via customer application  forms, insertion orders and other forms. If you do not want your Personal  Information collected, please do not submit it. In order to  ensure the safekeeping of your information, network advertising companies and  publishers are not permitted to directly collect Personal Information through  the Service.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a name="Two" id="Two"><strong>2. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></a></li>
</ol>
<p>Outbrain  uses the information we collect about and from you for a variety of business  purposes, including for example, to: respond to your questions and requests;  provide you with access to certain functions and features of the Service;  verify your identity; communicate with you about your account and activities using  the Service and, in our discretion, to communicate changes to any Outbrain  policy; tailor  content recommendations we serve you; improve the Service and for internal  business purposes; process applications and transactions; and for  purposes we disclose at the time you provide your Personal Information or to  which you otherwise consent. </p>
<ol>
  <li><a name="Three" id="Three"><strong>3. SHARING OF INFORMATION</strong></a><strong> </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Except  as provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not provide any of your Personal  Information to any third parties without your specific consent. We may share  non-Personal Information, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic  information, and Usage Information with third parties. We may combine your Usage  Information with those of other users of the Service in order to share trend information with third parties, always in aggregated and anonymized form. For  example, we may use your Usage Information as part of an aggregated number to  tell a prospective sponsor how many people in the Outbrain network visit sports  web sites each month. </p>
<p>We  may also share your information as disclosed at the  time you provide your information, as set forth in this Privacy Policy and in  the following circumstances:<br><br>
  <strong> Services On Our Behalf.</strong><a name="_DV_M111" id="_DV_M111"></a>Though we normally  perform all of the Services “in-house”, in order to carry out your requests, to make various  features, services and materials available to you through the Service, and to  respond to your inquiries, in certain instances we may share your Usage  Information or Personal Information with third parties that perform functions  on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners), such as companies or individuals  that: host or operate the Service; analyze data or provide  customer service. We enter into agreements with all third parties who process Personal Information on our behalf to ensure that they do so in accordance with our instructions and applicable data protection laws.</p>

As we continue to develop  our business, we may sell or purchase a business or assets. If we purchase another  entity or if another entity acquires us or all or substantially all of our  assets, or assets related to the Service, Personal Information, Usage  Information, and any other information that we have collected about the users  of the Service may be disclosed to such entity as part of the due diligence  process and, if we or our assets are acquired, will be transferred to such  entity as one of the transferred assets. Also, if any bankruptcy or  reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may  be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third  parties.<a name="_Toc232579058" id="_Toc232579058"> </a><br><br>
  <strong>Legal </strong><strong>Disclosure.<em> <a name="_DV_M126" id="_DV_M126"></a></em></strong> Outbrain may  transfer and disclose information, including your Personal Information, Usage  Information and Device Identifier, to third parties to  comply with certain legal obligations when we believe in good faith that the  law requires it; at the request of governmental authorities conducting an  investigation; to verify, enforce or apply our <a href="http://www.outbrain.com/legal/tos"><strong><u>Terms  of Use</u></strong></a> or other applicable policies; to respond  to an emergency; or otherwise to protect the rights, property, safety, or  security of Outbrain, our customers or others. This may include exchanging  information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud  protection and credit risk reduction. </p>

<ol>
  <li><a name="Four" id="Four"><strong>4. ADVERTISING/BEHAVIORAL TARGETTING; HOW TO OPT-OUT</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may use third party analytics vendors to evaluate  and provide us with information about the use of the Service. We do not share  Personal Information with these third parties, but they may set and access  their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your Device and they  may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information. </p>
<p>We may also use third party redirects, which will redirect you through a third party server before redirecting to the final landing page. On this redirect, the third party may place its own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device (e.g. for purposes of retargeting) and collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information.</p>
<div style="border:1px solid #000000; font-weight:bold !important;padding:5px"><p>If the privacy of your clicks on recommendations, or  the pages you visit is a concern for you, we urge you to do the following:</p>
<ul><li>Do NOT  click any recommendation you do not want to be associated with.</li>
  <li>Opt  out of Outbrain's personalization tracking.</li> <u><a href="#Eleven">You may do this by clicking on the “Opt-Out” button at the bottom of  this Privacy Policy</a></u>.<strong></strong></ul></div>
<p>When you opt out of Outbrain's personalization  tracking, we will no longer use information about the pages you visit to tailor  our internal recommendations and promoted content recommendations to your  interests. We will still use information about the document you are viewing to  provide you internal recommendations and promoted content  recommendations on that page.</p>
<p><strong>Opting  out of Outbrain personalization tracking does not mean you will no longer  receive internal recommendations and promoted content recommendations from  Outbrain.</strong> It does mean that the internal recommendations and promoted  content recommendations we serve you will not be personalized based on pages  you read in the Outbrain network. You will likely receive less benefit from the  Service since our recommendations will not be as well tailored to your  interests.</p>
<p><strong>We  place cookies on your Device to prevent personalization tracking.</strong> Opting out of personalization tracking is not the same as blocking cookies.  When you opt out of Outbrain personalization tracking, we will place a special  Outbrain cookie on your Device that informs our servers not to record  information about the pages you're visiting. If you browse the web from several  Devices, you will need to opt out from each Device to ensure that we prevent  personalization tracking on all of them. For the same reason, if you buy a new Device,  change browsers or delete this cookie (or clear all cookies), you will need to perform this opt-out  task again.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a name="Five" id="Five"><strong>5. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS, CHOICE AND ACCESS. </strong></a><strong> </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You  may always direct us not to share your Personal Information with third parties,  not to use your Personal Information to provide you with information or offers,  or not to send you newsletters, e-mails or other communications by: (i) sending  us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:legal@outbrain.com">legal@outbrain.com</a>; (ii) contacting us by  mail at 39 West 13th Street, 3rd floor, New York, NY  10011, Attn: Legal Department; or (iii) following the removal instructions in  the communication that you receive. Your opt-out request will be processed  within 30 days of the date on which we receive it.<br><br>
  If you wish to verify, correct, or update any of  your information collected through the Service, you may edit your profile  preferences or contact us at the above address or e-mail. In accordance with  our routine record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal  Information you have submitted through the Service. We are under no obligation to store such  Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or  related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. In addition, you should be aware that it is  not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from  our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons. </p>
<ol>
  <li><a name="Six" id="Six"><strong>6. CHILDREN.</strong></a><strong> </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The  Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone under 13 years of age, and we  ask people in our <a href="http://www.outbrain.com/legal/tos"><strong><u>Terms of Use</u></strong></a> not to register with us and  not to submit Personal Information if they are under 18. If we determine upon  collection that a user is under 13, we will not use or maintain his/her  Personal Information without the parent/guardian’s consent. If we become aware  that we have unknowingly collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such  information from our records. If you’re a kid, please go play in the yard, don’t register for Outbrain!</p>
<ol>
  <li><a name="Seven" id="Seven"><strong>7. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></a><strong>. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We  maintain tight controls over all the data we collect, retaining it in  firewalled and secured databases with strictly limited and controlled access  rights, to ensure it is secure. Where we  have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access  certain features of the Service, you are responsible for keeping this password  confidential. Please remember that unfortunately, the transmission of  information via the internet is not completely secure, so although we will do  our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of  your data transmitted via the Service; any transmission is at your own risk.  Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and  security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a name="Eight" id="Eight"><strong>8. OTHER SITES.</strong></a><strong> </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The  Service may contain links to other sites that we do not own or operate. This includes links  from customers, sponsors and partners that may use our  logo(s) as part of a co-branding agreement. We do not control, recommend or endorse and are not  responsible for these sites or their content, products, services or privacy  policies or practices. These other web  sites may send their own cookies to your Device, they may independently collect  data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own  published privacy policies. You should also independently assess the authenticity of any site which  appears or claims that it is a part of the Service (including those linked to  through an email or social networking page). </p>
