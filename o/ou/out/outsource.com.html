							<div class="font-18 font-semi-bold m-top-30">1. Type of Information Collected</div>

							<p class="font-16 m-top-10 line-24">
								We may collect personally identifiable information("PII" - for example, your full name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number) from you when you voluntarily submitting the information while purchasing the items from us. We need this information in order to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status, in order to register you as a user of this site or to provide you with services. We may also collect PII from you if you choose to subscribe to our email program, or participate in sweepstakes, contests, and surveys, or in connection with content or suggestions you post on this site.<br>
								We also collect non-personally identifiable information ("Non-PII" - for example, interests, hobbies, lifestyle choices, groups with whom you are affiliated) from you when you choose to provide or post non-PII information on this website.<br>

We and our third party service providers use cookies and Pixel Tags to identify your IP address, browser type, domain name, and specific web pages through which you click. This data is collected automatically and utilized to help us look for trends to improve our website and your interactive experience.

Additional information regarding browser cookies and how to disable them is described below.<br><br>
								Information Collected Upon Registration. If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Website, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Outsource.com.
