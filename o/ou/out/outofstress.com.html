<p>Last updated: 17th October 2018</p>
<p>Welcome to the Privacy Policy of *Outofstress.com. The privacy of our website visitors is very important to us, and we are committed to safeguarding it. This policy explains what personal information we connect, what we collect it for and how we safeguard this information.</p>
<p>Our website address is: <a href="https://outofstress.com">https://outofstress.com</a>.</p>
<h2>What information we collect</h2>
<p>Depending on how you interact with our site, we might collect some personal information from you. The following is the type of data we collect and why we collect it.</p>
<h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
<h3>1. Personal Data</h3>
<p><strong>When you visit our site</strong> – our web server will automatically collect your IP address, and unique online identifiers like your operating system, your browser software, browser version, device type, session start/stop time, time zone, cookie information, your general location (city and country), and general information regarding your online behavior like clicks, actions, search queries, installed apps, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other diagnostic data.</p>
<p>These details are pseudonimyzed (cannot directly identify you) and are collected for the purpose of delivering relevant content and ads and operating and improving our Service (including services from our partners).</p>
<p><strong>When you subscribe to our newsletter or contact us using a contact form on this site</strong> – we will collect your name, IP address and email address. We use this information to send you relevant emails and marketing materials.</p>
<p><strong>When you comment on our site </strong>– When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
<p>An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/">https://automattic.com/privacy/</a>. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.</p>
<p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p>
<p>We may use your Personal Data to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send.</p>
<h3>2. Tracking &amp; Cookies Data</h3>
<p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and hold certain information.</p>
<p>A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.</p>
<p>Examples of Cookies we use:</p>
<p><strong>session cookies</strong> (we use these cookies to operate our Service) and <strong>preference cookies</strong> (we use these cookies to remember your preferences and various settings).</p>
<p><strong>We use cookies for the following purposes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>(a) authentication</strong> – We use cookies to identify you when you visit my website and as you navigate my website;</p>
<p><strong>(b) personalization</strong> – We use cookies [to store information about your preferences and to personalize the website for you];</p>
<p><strong>(c) security</strong> – We use cookies as an element of the security measures used to protect user accounts, including preventing fraudulent use of login credentials, and to protect my website and services generally;</p>
<p><strong>(d) advertising</strong> – We use cookies to help me to display advertisements that will be relevant to you; and</p>
<p><strong>(e) analysis</strong> – We use cookies to help us to analyze the use and performance of our website and services;</p>
<p>You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.</p>
<p>Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies and to delete cookies. The methods for doing so vary from browser to browser, and from version to version. You can however obtain up-to-date information about blocking and deleting cookies via these links:</p>

<h3>3. Embedded content from other websites</h3>
<p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>

<h3>4. Analytics</h3>
<p>We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.</p>

This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).</p>
