Our channels for collecting personal data include: (1) you provide us your data directly, (2)we record certain data about how you interact with our products, and/or (3) we obtain certain data about you from third parties.</p><p><br></p><p>The data we collect depends on the environment in which you interact with OPPO, the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use. It is worth noting that we usually treat the shipping area recorded on the mobile phone box as the actual location where your phone is used and comply with local laws and regulations, including those for data protection.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal data we collect</strong></p><p><strong>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information directly provided by you</strong></p><p>The services we provide for you require you to provide information directly to us. For instance:</p><p><br></p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registering an OPPO ID or filling out a warranty card/electronic warranty card requires you to create an account or to complete a personal profile. In these services, we may ask you to provide personal data to set up an account or a personal profile. Types of personal data include name, date of birth, mobile number, email address, username and password created, photos, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you order products from us, request a return or refund, or use a paid service, we may collect your delivery details, bank account number, credit card details, billing address, information for credit check and other financial information, contact and communication records, etc., so we can process your order.</p><p><br></p><p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of our services allow you to communicate and share with others. The communicated or shared content may be transmitted through and stored in our system.</p><p><br></p><p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Face and Fingerprints Recognition enables rapid unlocking of your device with your pre-recorded facial or fingerprint information. To achieve the above objectives, you will need to provide your facial feature information from different angles or your fingerprint information (which will only be stored locally within your device). &nbsp;We will not upload your facial feature or fingerprint information onto our servers, which means it is impossible for us to disclose such information to any third party or use it for any other purpose.</p><p><br></p><p>We may ask you to provide personal data and collect it under other circumstances, these circumstances include participating in prize draws or competitions, participating in promotional or marketing activities organized by us or our business partners, completing questionnaires, participating in user forums or blogs hosted by us or our business partners. The information you provide helps us design and improve the products, personalize your shopping experience, and provide purchase suggestions. We may match your information with third-party data to better understand your needs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service usage information</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p>In addition to the information you provide, we may also collect information about your use of our services through software on your device and other means. For example, we may collect:</p><p><br></p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Device information — such as device name, device model, region and language settings, device identification number (IMEI number, etc.), device hardware information and status, usage habits, IP address, operating system version, and settings of the device used to access the service.</p><p><br></p><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Log information — such as when and how long the service is used, search terms entered through the service, and error log information of your device. Because of the design features of the Android system, when you choose to share error log information of your device with us, the Android system may sometimes send us simultaneously the personal information such as phone number, email address, Facebook account, etc. We promise not to use such information for personal identification and after analyzing the error log data, we will periodically clear such data (usually within 30 days after collection).</p><p><br></p><p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Location information — such as the device’s GPS signal or information about nearby WiFi access points and cell towers, ID of the device’s location, network service provider ID, which may be sent to us when you use certain services. We will ask you which applications you want to enable location-based services for. You can modify the location settings of your device from the device settings, such as changing or disabling the method or server used in location-based services, or modifying the accuracy of your location information, hence changing the location information provided to OPPO.</p><p><br></p><p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voice information — for example, audio that we record (and may store on our servers) when you use voice commands to control the service.</p><p><br></p><p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Album information — for example, to provide you with the function to display photo locations as well as to classify your photos and videos, we need to collect the latitude and longitude information of your photo and video files; when you search for a certain picture, we will collect the term you entered and the number of pictures identified locally .</p><p><br></p><p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Camera — to ensure the camera app works normally, we collect the operational data (e.g. how many times you use the app), information about your device (e.g. IMEI, device model, IP address, version of operating system), characteristic information about the photos taken (e.g. photosensitivity, number of faces captured) and the information of available space left in your mobile.</p><p><br></p><p>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other information about your use of the service — such as the version of the application being used, the website visited, and how you interact with the content provided through the service.</p><p><br></p><p>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that we may cooperate with third-party service providers to achieve the above business functions, for instance, when a third-party service provider provides voice to text conversion services on our behalf, it may receive and store certain personal data. These third parties may not use this information for any other purpose.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obtaining data from a third party</strong></p><p>Where permitted by law, we may obtain data about you from public or commercial sources and may combine it with other information received or relevant to you. If you choose to use our services by logging in with third-party accounts such as QQ, WeChat, Alipay, Weibo, and Facebook, etc., we may also obtain your public information from these services, such as your alias, profile picture, etc.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How we use your personal data</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p>We may process your personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy with your consent, to perform our obligations to you under our user agreement and/or service contract, for compliance with a legal obligation to which OPPO is subject or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by OPPO or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information. OPPO will strictly abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy and its updates to use your personal data. Your personal data will only be used for the purpose determined at the time of collection, which has been approved by you. If there is any use other than this, we will obtain your consent in advance. Examples of related usages are as follows:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>·&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide and improve our products. </strong>The personal data we collect will be used to provide you with OPPO's products and services, process your orders or fulfill the contract between you and OPPO to ensure the functionality and safety of our products and services, to verify your identity, to prevent and investigate fraud or other improper use.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>·&nbsp;&nbsp; Customer Support. </strong>We use data to diagnose product issues, repair customer equipment, and provide other customer care and support services.

We also use this information to improve our products and analyze the efficiency of our business operations. However, we will not use this information to track your location. We may also &nbsp;collect your email address to reply your questions or comments raised in the “Contact Us” section of our websites.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>·&nbsp;&nbsp; Product Improvements.</strong> We use data to constantly improve our products, including the addition of new features and functionality. For example, we use error reports to improve security features and use usage data to determine cell phone sequencing. We use mobile phone numbers obtained through offline sales channels, electronic warranties, and account registrations to conduct survey and return visit to users in order to improve user experience.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>·&nbsp;&nbsp; Advertising. </strong>The personal data we collect will be used to personalize the product and to provide you with more tailored services, for example: your information can be used to recommend and display content and advertisements tailored to you on our services, or be used to conduct research and pay return visits to customers. In order to improve our products or services, with your consent, we may match your personal data (including but not limited to the de-identified location information so that it is no longer associated with a particular person) with third-party data to form a user profile so that we can conduct product development or deliver targeted product information to you (through post, email, phone and fax).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>·&nbsp;&nbsp; Commercial Promotion Activities. </strong>If you participate in prize draws, contests or similar promotional activities held by OPPO, we will use the personal data you provide to manage such activities.</p><p><br></p><p>We will acquire your consent in advance when the information is to be used for a purpose that is not specified in this Privacy Policy.
