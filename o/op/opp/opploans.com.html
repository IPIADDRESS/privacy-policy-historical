Testimonials provide the perspective of individuals who are successful and/or enthusiastic about their experience.

      <p><sup>1</sup>Loan amounts may vary and are dependent upon qualification criteria and state law. First time Opportunity Financial customers typically qualify for an installment loan of $250 to $1,000 with an APR of 99 to 160%, or 40 to 70% less than the average 600% APR for a payday loan. For example, a $500 loan made or arranged by Opportunity Financial at 99% to 160% APR would require 11 to 17 bi-weekly installment payments of $40 to $60. After the 11th and 17th successful payment, your loan would be paid in full. A typical payday loan of $500 with an APR of 600% and a fourteen (14) day term would require one payment of $615.07. Typical payday loan pricing is based on Texas-originated loans facilitated by credit access businesses.</p>
      <p><strong>Implications of Late Payments</strong></p>
      <p>Individuals who do not pay their short term loans back on time may be subject to additional fees and collection methods. These will be clearly stated in the contract, so borrowers should be sure to review this information before providing their electronic signatures on any legally binding documents.</p>
      <p><strong>Implications of Non-Payment</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Financial Implications</b> The borrower will accrue additional interest and a late payment fee of $10 to $15 for every payment that is more than 10 to 14 days past due and is clearly stated in the TILA disclosures in the contract and is based on state rules and regulations. In addition, a $25 fee will be charged when a payment is returned by your bank.</li>
        <li style="overflow:hidden"><b>Debt Collection </b>We perform our own collections and also work with a third party collection agency. Opportunity Financial adheres to the regulations set forth by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, or FDCPA. These regulations can be found at the FTC website located here: http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fdcpa/fdcpact.shtm.</li>
        <li><b>Reflection on Credit Score </b> As with other forms of consumer debt, failure to repay short term loans in a timely manner may reflect poorly on the borrower’s credit. This is because we have the right to file reports with credit rating companies when debts are not repaid, thereby negatively impacting the borrower’s credit score. After the loan has been repaid, the credit report will be updated.</li>
        <li><b>Automatic Loan Renewal</b> Loans we make or arrange are fully amortizing installment loans. A loan is not automatically renewed.</li>
