    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>Gathering and Use of Information</h2>

<p>OPB collects personal information through OPB.org, but only when voluntarily provided by visitors to the Site. Visitors to OPB.org may voluntarily supply certain personally identifiable information in connection with (i) contest or sweepstakes registration, (ii) subscription registration for sites or services which require subscription (such as email newsletters), (iii) requests for membership information and (iv) e-commerce transactions.</p>

<p>OPB may use such information only for conducting the activities stated above, for internal marketing and promotional purposes, or, on occasion, when mailing lists are made available to other nonprofit organizations. (The occasional provision of mailing lists to such organizations is the only case where such information would be provided to third parties). If the visitor does not want this information collected and used by us for the disclosed internal purposes, the visitor should contact webmaster@www.opb.org. Our visitors need to recognize, however, that under certain circumstances, if they select to "opt-out," they may not be eligible for certain activities for which the personally identifiable information is needed.</p>

<p>OPB's server tracks how you and other visitors use the site, identifying the source of visitors to OPB.org and what pages they use on the site. By looking at this "traffic," OPB can better understand our community, which allows us to improve our Web site and to provide you with an optimal experience and better service. In order to provide this optimal service and convenience OPB uses "cookies." A cookie is a temporary code placed in your computer by our server that facilitates communication and saves you time when you browse our Web site. Cookies are completely anonymous and help us serve you. At no time does the cookie reveal your name, address or telephone number (even if you have entered these in other areas of OPB.org). You always have the ability to configure your Web browser to refuse cookies (please consult your browser's user's guide for instructions).</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>

<p>OPB makes every effort to ensure that all of the transactions that occur on its Web site are secure. All credit card numbers submitted to the site are encrypted, which is the industry standard for information security and is used by more than 100,000 Web sites in more than 50 countries. Any personal information you submit with your pledge is encrypted with 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. In the unlikely event that the information you send is intercepted, it is nearly impossible to decrypt the information. Your peace of mind and security is very important to us. If you do not feel comfortable submitting your personal information online, you can make your pledge by calling OPB at 1-800-241-8123.</p>

  <h2>Kids</h2>

<p>OPB's Web site is a general audience web site and does not knowingly market to or collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 18 years old. However, OPB believes that it is important to assist parents in supervising their children's on-line activities and, therefore, recommends that parents consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address and other personally identifiable information online without parental permission. Please contact webmaster@opb.org if you have further questions.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>

<p>OPB's Web site may contain links to other Internet Web sites. OPB encourages its partners, contributors and other third parties to implement policies and practices that respect your privacy. OPB is not, however, responsible for other Web site's privacy practices or Web site content. Occasionally, you may receive cookies from third party advertisers, partners and vendors. OPB does not control these cookies.</p>

  <h2>Acceptance of OPB Website Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions</h2>

<p>By using this site, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this OPB Web Site Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use the site. OPB reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the OPB Web site following the posting of any changes to these terms shall mean that you have accepted those changes. If you have any questions or concerns, please email us at webmaster@opb.org.</p>
