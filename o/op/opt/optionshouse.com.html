                        <li>Information obtained from others, such as credit reporting agencies.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p></p>
                <p>If any of the above noted personal information changes, please contact us so that we may update your account.</p>
                <ul class="point">
                    <li>How Information Helps Both You and Us </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our mission is clear: to help you reach your financial goals. Information about you and your accounts plays a key role in our ability to succeed in this mission.  It also helps us service your accounts and administer our business.</p>
                <p>For example, we use information about you to: </p>
                    <ul style="margin-left:30px;">
                        <li>Respond more accurately and efficiently to your requests.</li>
                        <li>Identify opportunities to give you more convenience and control by developing new services that may benefit you.</li>
                        <li>Secure your accounts and help protect you and OptionsHouse from fraud.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p></p>
                <ul class="point">
                    <li>Keeping Information Safe</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We limit access to the information we have about you to those employees who need to know to provide you with services to help you meet your financial needs.  We maintain appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information.</p>
                 <ul class="point">
                    <li>The Importance of Being Accurate</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We have security standards and procedures in place designed to prevent unauthorized access to your accounts and personal information.  A key part of this process ensures that all information we have about you is accurate and up-to-date.  If you ever discover inaccuracies in our data or if your personal information changes, we urge you to notify us immediately.</p>
                  <ul class="point">
                    <li>Protect Your Password</li>
                </ul>
                <p>One way to guard against unauthorized access or intrusion to your account is to keep your OptionsHouse password private.  Note: OptionsHouse does not have access to your password.  Here are some suggestions on how to choose and safeguard your password:</p>

                    <ul style="margin-left:30px;">
                        <li>Do not share your password with anyone. </li>
                        <li>Do not write your password down. </li>
                        <li>Type your password each time it is required of you. Do not save your password on the site entry screen or develop a shortcut to reproducing your password</li>
                        <li>Avoid using easily guessed words such as your name, user id, or any variation thereof (backwards, changing case, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Avoid words referring to anything noticeable about you: the name of your spouse, child, pet, your favorite football team, or literary character. </li>
                        <li>Avoid any combination of your office number, address, birthday, or anniversary. </li>
                        <li>Avoid any combination of your license-plate number, your social-security number. </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>If you feel that your password is no longer secure, please change it immediately.   </p>
                 <ul class="point">
                    <li>We Limit The Sharing Of Information </li>
                </ul>
                <p>To protect your privacy, we limit the information we share outside OptionsHouse.  We conduct our business with great respect for the confidential nature of the information being provided. We will not share information about you except as outlined below. We do not sell customer (current or former) information to third parties under any circumstance.</p>
                 <ul class="point">
                    <li>Sharing Information With Companies Who Help Us Provide You Services</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We may share the information described under the Section captioned "Information We Collect" with affiliates of OptionsHouse.  Additionally, this information may be shared with companies external to OptionsHouse ("outside companies" or "third parties") to complete a transaction you have requested,  to help us service your account, and to allow us to offer you improved  products and services.  We are highly selective in choosing these companies.  All companies with whom we do business are contractually obligated to comply with strict standards regarding security and confidentiality, and the information can be used only for the sole purpose of providing the service we have requested the company to perform.  </p>
				
				<p>Examples of the types of outside companies with which we may share information to help us service your account include non-financial companies that perform services for us such as data processing and companies that perform securities execution and clearing services on our behalf.  In order to offer improved products and services to you, we may engage outside companies who use third-party technology to assist us with certain functions such as client satisfaction surveys, business or marketing analysis, or other data collection activities relevant to our business.  Use of any information shared is strictly limited to the performance of the task we request and for no other purpose.</p>
                 <ul class="point">
                    <li>Sharing Information In Other Situations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>OptionsHouse may also be required to release your information to third parties as required by law or to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities. This may include releasing such information to nonaffiliated parties such as Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as well as any of the securities exchanges or regulatory authorities in states in which OptionsHouse is registered. OptionsHouse may also be required to disclose nonpublic, personal information as required under court order or subpoena or for certain obligations of OptionsHouse under the USA Patriot Act.</p>
                 <ul class="point">
                    <li>Linking to Other Sites</li>
                </ul>
                <p>From time to time, OptionsHouse Web Site may provide links to other Web Sites not owned or controlled by OptionsHouse that we think might be useful or of interest to you.

                 <ul class="point">
                    <li>Opting Out</li>
                </ul>

                 <ul class="point">
                    <li>Notification of Changes to OptionsHouse's Privacy Policy</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The OptionsHouse Privacy Policy may change from time to time.

                <p>
                Mail Preference Service<br>

                </p>

                <p>To remove your name from telemarketing lists, write:</p>
                <p>
                Telephone Preference Service<br>
