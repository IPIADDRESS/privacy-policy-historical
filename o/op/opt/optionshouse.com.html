                                        <li>Type your password each time it is required of you. Do not save your password on the site entry screen or develop a shortcut to reproducing your password</li>
                                        <li>Avoid using easily guessed words such as your name, user id, or any variation thereof (backwards, changing case, etc.).</li>
                                        <li>Avoid words referring to anything noticeable about you: the name of your spouse, child, pet, your favorite football team, or literary character. </li>
                                        <li>Avoid any combination of your office number, address, birthday, or anniversary. </li>
                                        <li>Avoid any combination of you license-plate number, your social-security number. </li>
