<p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make   your  experience on the Internet as enjoyable and profitable as possible and  want   you to use the services and products we offer with complete  confidence.</p>
<p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our  commitment to privacy   and security. This Privacy Policy describes how  our company collects information   from all the people who use our  Internet services (the Services). Those who   visit our site and may  access some our Services without having accounts with us   (Visitors) as  well as those who purchase Products and pay a fee to subscribe to   our  Services (Members). It also sets out what we do with the information we    collect and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the  collection and   use of this information. We ask that you read this  Privacy Policy carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information Our Company Collects And How It Is Used</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our company collects  information in different ways from Visitors   and Members who access the  various parts of our Services on this or related web   sites. We use  this information mainly to provide a personalized experience as   you  use our Products and Services and generally do not share this  information   with third parties.</p>
<p>However, we may disclose personal information collected, if  we have received   your prior permission, or in very special  circumstances as when we believe   disclosure is required by law and in  the special cases described below.</p>
<p><strong>Upon Registration&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;Members may be asked to  provide certain personal information   when they sign up for our  Products and Services including name, address,   telephone number,  billing information, (such as credit card number), and the   type of  personal computer being used to access the Services. Personal    information collected from Members during the registration process is  used to   manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes.)  This information is   not shared with third parties, except as  specifically stated or in special   circumstances.</p>
<p>However in instances where our company and a partner jointly  promote our   Services, we may provide the partner some personal  information like the name,   address and user name of the persons who  subscribed who subscribed to the   Services as a result of the joint  promotion solely for the purpose of allowing   us and the partner to  asses the results of the promotion.</p>
<p>In this case, personal information may not be used by the  partner for any other   purpose. We may also generate general  non-identifying profiles from personal   information our Members provide  during registration, (like total number, but not   the names of  Members). As explained below, we would use this information to sell    advertisements which may appear in the Services.</p>
<p><strong>With Partners&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;Some Products and Services  may be offered to Visitors and Members   in conjunction with an  affiliate, independent contract seller or non-affiliated   partner. To  provide Visitors and Members with some of these Products and   Services,  the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information. In    such cases, you will be notified before any of your data is collected  or   transferred, giving you the choice of consent and allowing you to  decide whether   to use that particular feature or service.</p>
<p><strong>Shopping </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you order Products or  Services from our company we will use the   personal information you  provide only to process the order. We do not share this   information  with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete the    order.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisements&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;Our company may display  online advertisements. In those cases we   share general non-identifying  profile information about our Visitors and Members   collected during  the registration process as well as through online surveys and    promotions with these advertisers.</p>
<p>In some cases, we use this general non-identifying profile  information to   deliver specific advertisements and for joint ventures.  As an example, an   advertiser or joint venture company tells us the  audience they want to reach and   provides us an advertisement tailored  to the audience. Based upon the general   non-identifying profile  information we have collected, we may then display or   send the  information to the intended people. Our company does not share personal    information of Visitors and Members with these advertisers or joint  venture   partners.</p>
<p><strong>Responses to Email Inquiries&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;When  Visitors or Members send email inquiries to   our company, the return  email address is used to answer the email inquiry we   receive. Our  company does not use the return email address we receive for any   other  purpose and does not share the return email address with anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>Voluntary Customer Surveys&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;We may  periodically conduct both business and   individual customer surveys. We  encourage our customers to participate in these   surveys because they  provide us with important information which helps us to   improve the  types of products and services we offer and how we provide them to   you  for your benefit. Your personal information and responses will remain    strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third  party.   Participation in customer surveys is voluntary.</p>
<p>We may take the information we receive from people responding  to our surveys and   combine it with the responses of other customers  we have to prepare broader,   general responses to the survey questions  (such as age, gender, residence,   hobbies, education, employment,  industry and other demographic information). We   then use this  information to improve the quality of the Services and Products we    provide to you and to develop new products and services. This general    non-identifying profile information may be shared with third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Special Cases&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;It is our company's policy  not to use or share the personal   information we collect about Visitors  and Members in ways unrelated to the ones   described above without  also providing you the prior opportunity to opt out and   prohibit such  unrelated disclosures.</p>
<p>However we may disclose information about Visitors or  Members, or information   concerning your use of the Services and  Products or Websites accessible through   the use of our Services or  Products for any reason, if in our sole discretion we   feel it is  reasonable to do so (as permitted by law were applicable) such as to    credit agencies, collection agencies, law enforcement, to protect the  interests   of our Company and Members, or as required by law.</p>
<p><strong>"Cookies"&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive   when you visit certain web sites.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Cookies&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;Our company may use  "cookies" to collect, store and track   data for statistical purposes to  improve the products and services we provide   and to manage our  networks.</p>
<p>If you are a Visitor or Member we may use cookies to save  your settings and   provide customized and personal service. These  cookies do not allow any third   parties to access any of your customer  information. Advertisers and Partners may   also use cookies. We have no  control over their actions and we specifically   disclaim any  responsibility for information they may collect.</p>
<p><strong>Our Company's policy towards child privacy </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The privacy of children is   important to all of us. To ensure  compliance with any applicable children   privacy laws we restrict our  Web site to people 18 years of age or over.</p>
<p>You must be eighteen (18) years of age or over to access this  web site. If   you are under eighteen (18) years of age, you are not  permitted to access this   web site for any reason. Due to the age  restrictions, we do not monitor this web   site for compliance with any  applicable children privacy laws.</p>
<p><strong>Our Company's Commitment To Data Security&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;Services  and Websites we sponsor   have security measures in place to protect  the loss, misuse and alteration of   data under our control. While we  take all reasonably necessary steps to protect   the integrity and  security of our data and networks, we cannot guarantee our   security  measures will prevent "<br> third party" hackers from illegally accessing   our data.</p>
<p><strong>Revisions&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;Our Company reserves the right  to revise, amend or modify this   policy our Terms of Service Agreement  and our other policies and agreements at   any time and in any manner,  by updating this posting.</p>
