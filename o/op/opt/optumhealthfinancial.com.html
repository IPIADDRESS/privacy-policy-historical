            <p><b>Introduction</b><br>
               We recognize that the privacy of your personal information is important. The purpose of this policy is to let you know how we handle the information collected through the use of this website. Portions of this website may describe privacy practices applicable to specific types of information or to information provided on specific web pages. 
            </p>
            <p>This policy does not apply to information collected through other means such as by telephone or in person, although that information may be protected by other privacy policies. As used in this policy, terms such as âweâ or âourâ and âCompanyâ refer to Optum and its current and future affiliated entities, including our parent company UnitedHealth Group. </p>
            <p>This website is intended for a United States audience. Any information you provide, including any personal information, will be transferred to and processed by a computer server located within the United States.</p>
            <p><b>Cookies and Tracking </b><br>
               The Company uses various technologies, which may include âcookieâ technology, to gather information from our website visitors such as pages visited and how often they are visited, and to enable certain features on this website. âCookiesâ are small text files that may be placed on your computer when you visit a website or click on a URL. Cookies may include âsingle-session cookiesâ which generally record information during only a single visit to a website and then are erased, and âpersistentâ cookies, which are generally stored on a computer unless or until they are deleted or are set to expire.
