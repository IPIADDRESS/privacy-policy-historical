<p><strong>Internet privacy policy</strong></p>


	<p>OPTIMIZERx and its participating sponsors recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of information we may collect from our online visitors. To this end, we are committed to using our best efforts to respect the privacy of our online visitors.

Please note, these companies are independent third parties over which OPTIMIZERx exercises no control. Therefore, we are not liable for, their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices.</p>


	<p><strong>Links to other sites</strong></p>


	<p>As a resource to our visitors, OPTIMIZERx provides links to other Web sites. We try to carefully choose Web sites we believe are useful and meet our high standards. However, because Web sites can change so quickly, we can’t guarantee the standards of every Web site link we provide or be responsible for the content of non-OPTIMIZERx sites.</p>


	<p><strong>Newsletters &amp; Emails to You</strong></p>


	<p>At registration and at various times as you use OPTIMIZERx be given the option of receiving recurring informational/promotional newsletters via email from OPTIMIZERx and/or directly from third parties.

However, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and OPTIMIZERx will not be intercepted by others and that information stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access.
