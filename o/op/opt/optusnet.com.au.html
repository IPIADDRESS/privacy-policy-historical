<h2 class="LBlueText">OptusNet Privacy Statement</h2>


OptusNet understands that your privacy is important to you. OptusNet wants to make your online experience as safe and as satisfying as possible. OptusNet complies with the requirements of the Telecommunications Act 1997, the Privacy Act 1988 and Industry Codes of Practice.  Our Privacy Policy describes what information we collect, how we use that information and what if any disclosures of that information we make.  The policy is organised into the following sections:
<p>
<a href="#1" class="LBluelink">1. Why do I need to supply personal information?</a><br>
<a href="#2" class="LBluelink">2. What other personal information is collected?</a><br>
<a href="#3" class="LBluelink">3. Navigation information</a><br>
<a href="#4" class="LBluelink">4. What happens with my personal information?</a><br>
<a href="#5" class="LBluelink">5. Will my personal information be given to anyone else?</a><br>
<a href="#6" class="LBluelink">6. Changes to your account information</a><br>
<a href="#7" class="LBluelink">7. Are my personal details safe when being transmitted to you?</a><br>
<a href="#8" class="LBluelink">8. Links to other sites</a><br>
<a href="#9" class="LBluelink">9. Contacting Cable &amp; Wireless Optus</a><br>
</p><p>
By signing up as a customer with OptusNet you consent to the use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this privacy statement.
</p><p>
<a name="1"></a><span class="DBlueText">1.	Why do I Need to Supply Personal Information?</span>
</p><p> The types of personal information that we record from you will depend on how 
you use our site. To become an OptusNet customer we require you to provide 
us with your name, address and telephone details, email address if applicable, 
company name and billing address if applicable and your credit card details so 
that we can set up an account in your name. We also ask you questions about your 
user requirements. Once this account is set up you will be provided with a user 
name and password which will let you access your account. We require this information 
to process your accounts and to improve the services we provide to you.

</p><p>
<a name="2"></a><span class="DBlueText">2.	What Other Personal Information is Collected?</span>
</p><p> During the registration process you may also choose to provide us with other 
voluntary information such as your details about yourself and your Internet usage 
so that we are able to better tailor our Internet services to your needs and to 
provide you with information you might be interested in. We may also conduct voluntary 
surveys from time to time which are aimed at ensuring that your service is personalised 
as far as possible. These surveys provide us with important information that allows 
us to improve the types and quality of the services that we offer and the manner 
in which we offer those services. We therefore encourage customers to participate 
in our voluntary surveys. You also have the opportunity to customise the service 
we offer you by providing information about your interests.

</p><p>
Each time you visit our web site certain anonymous navigation information is collected by our servers.  This information includes:
</p><ul type="circle">
<li>the type of browser and operating system you are using;</li>
<li>the address of the referring site (ie the previous site you had visited) and the website you leave our site to visit; </li>
<li>the date and time of your visit;</li>
<li>your server's IP address (a number which is unique to the machine);</li>
<li>the address of the pages you accessed.</li>
</ul>
 This information tells us how  our website is used and navigated, including the number of hits, the frequency of visits and the duration of visits to each web page on our site.  It does not identify individual users.
 <p>
 In addition, our website uses cookies.  A cookie is a piece of information that our website sends to your browser,  which is stored on your hard disk.  A cookie helps to identify your browser to us when you return to visit our site and helps identify the previous requests your browser has made. This allows us to help personalise the site to you on your return visits. Many websites incorporate cookies. Cookies themselves cannot  identify you personally.  You may opt out of the cookies, however doing so may prevent you from accessing some of the features of the site, such as customisation.
 </p><p>
 OptusNet displays advertising and links on its websites. These advertisers may use  cookies technology.  OptusNet does not have access to or control the use of cookies by our advertisers or sites to which we may provide a link.
 
</p><p> If you send us emails or other correspondence we may also retain these on 
your customer account file. We will not disclose your email address without your 
express consent.

</p><p>
<a name="4"></a><span class="DBlueText"> 4.	What happens with my Personal Information.</span>
</p><p>
 The personal information that we collect from you when you register as an OptusNet customer is or may be used:
</p><ul type="circle">
<li>for billing purposes</li>
<li>to ensure that you can access member's only areas</li>
<li>to enforce our use policy contained in our terms and conditions (where necessary)</li>
<li>to examine system accounting logs, user mailboxes and other company records to resolve e-mails and other system errors or problems</li>
<li>to customise the information you receive from our site, if you have provided additional information in a voluntary survey</li>
<li>to notify you about new services or promotions from time to time</li>
<li>in order to provide you with your start up kit</li> 
<li>to provide you with adequate customer service</li>
<li>These last two functions may be outsourced to external agencies who will only use your information for these purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p> We will notify you by email or by post about new OptusNet services and 
other special deals or services that may be of interest to you. If at any time 
you no longer wish to receive email of notices from us you can simply reply to 
the email with "unsubscribe" in the email subject line. Similarly if you no longer 
wish to receive postal communications from Optus then you can call Optus Customer 
Service on 1300 300 937.

</p><p>
<a name="5"></a><span class="DBlueText">5.	Will my personal information be given to anyone else?</span>
</p><p>
 OptusNet only discloses your personal information to third parties in accordance with the provisions set out in the <a href="/footer/f_terms.html">terms and conditions</a> of the service.  As described above we may disclose your information to a third party in order to enable certain functions to be performed such as to provide you with your start up kit or customer service. In some circumstances we may be required to provide personal information to government authorities such as law enforcement agencies or to other third parties where required or authorised by law, or in emergency situations.  Your credit information is dealt with on the basis set out in our terms and conditions.
</p><p>
 Individual survey responses submitted to OptusNet will be combined with or aggregated with other customer responses to provide OptusNet with broader generic responses to the survey questions such as for example the demographic characteristics and peak usage times of customers. OptusNet can then use this aggregated information to develop new and/or more appropriate services and products to offer to customers.
</p><p> In addition anonymous navigation information may be used and disclosed for 
statistical analysis of the site for marketing and to tailor the content of our 
site to the needs of our customer. This is particularly so where we offer links 
to other sites to ensure that the links we are offering are the ones which most 
suit our customer's needs.

</p><p>
 OptusNet strives to protect your personal information during its transmission. Customer account information and credit card details provided during the sign up server process are held in a secure server environment behind Optus firewalls. Access to this information is restricted to the holder of your OptusNet Username and Password. 
</p><p>
 Our secure server software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including your credit card number, your name and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. However, while Optus maintains high standards in protecting your security, no transmision over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure.
</p><p>
 You should also remember to always keep your Username and Password secret to further ensure that your OptusNet experience is a secure one. 
</p><p> We take reasonable steps to ensure the security of the personal information 
we hold from such risks as loss or unauthorised access, destruction, use, modification 
or disclosure of data. We also will take reasonable steps within the limitations 
of our technical and accounting system to destroy personal information if it is 
no longer needed for any purpose. We are however required to retain personal information 
in order to fulfil legal and accounting responsibilities and in order to resolve 
any disputes that may arise.
