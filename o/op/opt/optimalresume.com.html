        </div>
        <div class="description">


            <p><strong>OptimalResume.com, Inc.</strong> (“OptimalResume”, “ThinkOptimal”, “we”, “us”, “our” and terms of similar meaning) understands that your privacy rights are important to you.&nbsp; Therefore, we provide this Privacy Policy in order to describe our privacy practices, including how we collect, use and disclose your information and data in the course of providing our Services (as that term is defined in our Terms and Conditions, also referred to as the “Terms”).</p>

            

            <p>We encourage you to read and understand our Terms and this Privacy Policy before using our Services. By accepting the Terms and/or Privacy Policy in registration or by accessing or using the Services, you expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms. [Note: hyperlink all references to Terms.]</p>

            

            <p>All capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined herein are defined in &nbsp;the Terms.</p>

            

            <p><strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>

            

            <p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information from you is to provide the Services to you in a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized manner. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our Service to match your needs. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this limited purpose.</p>

            

            <p><em>Personal and Identifying Information</em></p>

            

            <p>In general, you can browse our Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. However, Users of our Services must provide various contact and identity information and other personal information that we refer to as Registration Data, as indicated where appropriate on the Services. &nbsp;Once the Registration Data has been provided, you are no longer anonymous to us. Where possible we endeavor to indicate which data fields are required and which fields are optional.&nbsp; In addition, as you use the Services, you can from time to time enter or send to us additional personal information.</p>

            

            <p>For all Users, we may collect your name, password, e-mail address, address, telephone number, education information, career and personal preferences, and any other personal information you choose to include in your profile or communicate to OptimalResume or other Users through your use of the Services. Employer users may also input additional information relating to their organization and any third party recruiters. You represent that you have the right and authority, or have obtained all necessary consents, to provide any Registration Data or other information, including any personal information of another individual or corporate information, that is provided by you to OptimalResume.</p>

            

            <p>You always have the option to not provide your personal information by choosing not to become a User or by not using the particular feature of the Services for which the information is being collected.</p>

            

            <p><em>Payment Information</em></p>

            

            <p>Some accounts on the Services, including, but not limited to employer accounts, are paid accounts. If you have signed up for a paid account, we may collect your credit card information for billing or payment purposes.&nbsp;</p>

            

            <p><em>Information Collected Automatically</em></p>

            

            <p>When you use the Services, OptimalResume automatically collects and records certain information, if not otherwise blocked by you, from your web browser or mobile platform, including your location, IP address, browser type, operating information, cookie information, and the page you requested. Unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, OptimalResume aggregates this type of information from all of its Users and only uses such information in aggregate form and not to identify any individual User.</p>

            

            <p><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></p>

            

            <p>We may use your Registration Data and other information we obtain from you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Services, to (1) provide the Services to you; (2) resolve service disputes; (3) troubleshoot problems; (4) measure consumer interest in our products and services, inform you about job opportunities, services, events and updates; (5) customize your experience; (6) detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; (7) enforce our Terms; (8) provide you with system or administrative messages; (9) and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection or in an updated version of this Privacy Policy.</p>

            

            <p>Please see our Terms for information on what we do to account information when you terminate your &nbsp;User Account.</p>

            

            <p><strong>Our Disclosure of Your Information</strong></p>

            

            <p>We will not share your personal information with third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with your User Account settings and permissions. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties without your explicit consent. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed in the normal provision of the Services to you:</p>

            

            <p><em>Data Shared with Other Users through the Service. </em>The data collected through the use of the Services, including personally identifiable information, may be shared with other Users in accordance with the permissions you set when you establish or modify your User Account. For example, the Services may permit you to apply to jobs of interest to you. By applying for such a job posting, you will be sharing your personal information with the posting Employer.</p>

            

            <p><em>Anonymized Aggregated Data.</em> We aggregate and anonymize data and use and disclose such information for a variety of purposes, including data analytics. However, in these situations, we do not disclose any information that could be used to identify you personally.</p>

            

            <p><em>Public Areas of the Services.</em> Users may be able to post Content that is viewable by others through the Services. For example, students can elect to share their resume with career counsellors. All User Content posted by a User will be identifiable to that User’s username.</p>

            

            <p><em>Subsidiaries and Affiliates; Service Providers</em>.&nbsp; We may from time to time use the services of affiliates, subsidiaries and unrelated service providers in the operation of the Services, and may disclose personal information to them in the course of our use of their services.&nbsp; For example, we may use the services of third-party hosting companies to host the operation of our Sites.&nbsp; This may involve the hosting of data, including personal information, on servers operated by those hosting companies.&nbsp; We may also use service providers to process payments of Users who wish to pay by credit card. We take care to use only service providers that we believe are reputable and able to maintain the security of personal information and confidential information.</p>

            

            <p><em>Law and Harm; Jurisdictions</em>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect our or any other person’s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s request, including requests made by government or regulatory authorities, to disclose your information.&nbsp;</p>

            

            <p><em>Storing or Processing Your Data Outside of the United States</em></p>

            <p>Your personal information and other data is generally stored on servers in the United States. However, in some cases, personal information that we collect may be stored or processed outside of the United States.&nbsp; In such cases, we continue to protect the information with appropriate safeguards, but it may be subject to the legal jurisdiction of those countries and governmental authorities in those countries.</p>

            

            <p><em>Sale of Business </em></p>

            

            <p>We may also disclose personal information to the acquiror or its agents in the course of the sale of our business.&nbsp; If we do this, the disclosure will be subject to confidentiality arrangements customary in such transactions.</p>

            

            <p><strong>Correcting and Updating Your Personal Information </strong></p>

            

            <p>You may review, delete and update your personal information to ensure it is accurate on your account profile, or you may contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@optimalresume.com">legal@optimalresume.com</a>.</p>

            

            <p><strong>Children’</strong><strong>s</strong> <strong>Privac</strong><strong>y</strong></p>

            

            <p>The Services are not intended for children under the age of thirteen (13). If you are under the age of eighteen (18), we encourage you to review our Terms and this Privacy Policy with an adult to understand what type of information we collect, how it is used and how it may be disclosed.</p>

            

            <p><strong>Security</strong></p>

            

            <p>Your OptimalResume User Account is protected by a password that you choose to protect your privacy and security. It is your sole responsibility to create, and periodically change, a strong password in order to prevent unauthorized access to your account, and to protect your password appropriately, and limit access to your computer or mobile device.</p>

            

            <p>In addition, we use high grade hosting services and security technologies, such as the use of SSL certificates to ensure a safe and secure environment.</p>

            

            <p>While we strive to protect your information and data we cannot guarantee the security of your User Account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>

            

            <p><strong>Other Information Collectors</strong></p>

            

            <p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties through the Services, different rules may apply to their use, collection and disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. Since we do not control the information use, collection or disclosure policies of third parties, you are also subject to the privacy policies of such other parties. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others, including to employers that you are introduced to through the Services.</p>

            

            <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>

            

            <p>OptimalResume may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. The use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the information is used; therefore it is important for you to review this Privacy Policy each time it is updated. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy and/or in the way we use your personal information or data, we will notify you by e-mailing you at your e-mail address used to register for the Services (if any) and by posting an announcement on the Site(s). Users are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when they use the Services after such changes have been first posted.</p>

            

            <p><strong>Questions?</strong></p>

            

            <p>It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. If you have questions, concerns or if you would like more detailed information, please email our privacy officer at <a href="mailto:legal@optimalresume.com">legal@optimalresume.com</a>.</p>
