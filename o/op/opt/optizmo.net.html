<h1>Privacy</h1>
<p><strong><span>Our Privacy Policy</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This privacy policy explains how Optizmo Technologies collects, uses, and discloses the information of users of the www.optizmo.net Website (the "our Company," or "our Website").</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important terms</span></strong></p>
<p><span>When reviewing any privacy policy on the Internet, you should be familiar with the terms "personally identifiable information" and "aggregate information." "Personally identifiable information" is any information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate you as an individual. Common examples are your name and email address. </span></p>
<p><span>"Aggregate information" lumps your behavior or characteristics together with those of a group. For instance, we may let advertisers know that 50% of our users are over 35 without disclosing the personal information of any one individual.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Collecting your information</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This section explains what information we collect through&nbsp;our Website. Important: Children under the age of 18 should use our Website under the supervision of their parents or guardians.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Information collected through our Website</span></strong></p>
<p><span>When you are registered for&nbsp;our Company&nbsp;Website we collect personally identifiable information, including (but not limited to) your name, physical address, email address, phone numbers, and billing information. All of this information is mandatory; without it we will not register you. We also collect personally identifiable information through purchase forms, surveys, sweepstakes entries, emails we receive from you, and your other interactions with our Website.</span></p>
<p><span>When you use our Website we may collect a variety of technical data. This data includes (but is not limited to) your IP address (a unique number that identifies your access account on the Internet), domain, and Web browser information. We may track the page you visited before coming to our Website, and the page you link to when you leave our Website, which of our pages you access, and how long you spend on each page.</span></p>
<p><span>Our&nbsp;Website may use "cookies," which are small pieces of information stored on your computer. Cookies let our Website recognize previous visitors to our web page, record a visitor's progress from page to page, and recall certain information a visitor entered previously. For instance, a cookie may store your name, or the last page you visited. You can choose to decline our cookies (e.g., by setting your browser to reject cookies), but if you do, some parts of the&nbsp;our Website may not operate properly.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, note that our Website may contain links to other sites on the Internet. Please remember that when you click on one of these links, you are leaving our Website and entering another. Again, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites, and encourage you to read their privacy statements (which may differ from ours).</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Using your information</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This section describes how we use and disclose the information we collect.</span></p>
<p><span>We may use aggregate information about your behavior and equipment to improve the performance of our Website. We may use personally identifiable information to customize the content and layout of our Website's pages for you, to record Website session information (such as items you have added to your shopping cart) order status, and to store your purchase history.</span></p>
<p><span>We may also use personally identifiable and aggregate information for a variety of marketing and promotional purposes. For instance, we may use what we have learned about your preferences to alert you to new areas when you return to our Website, or to help us or our business partners target advertising or product placements to your particular interests.</span></p>
<p><span>We do not intentionally share your personally identifiable information, except: (a) with other companies with whom we have substantial strategic or marketing relationships; (b) as required by law; and (c) in event of our Company's insolvency, with another entity in connection with the sale of&nbsp;our Company's&nbsp;assets. In addition, if you indicate your desire to receive a particular service or information from another company (e.g., catalogs), our Company will share your personally identifiable information with that particular company. Note finally that we may share aggregate data about our customers with third parties.</span></p>
<p><span>From time to time we will send you emails related your&nbsp;Website account. At various points during your visits to our Website, you could be provided opportunities to indicate an interest in receiving email about special offers and other promotional information. If you do not wish to receive special offers and promotional information email from us, please let us know by unchecking the "email subscription|newsletter" request box on our&nbsp;Website registration&nbsp;form. You may also opt out of this promotional email list after you have registered by logging in and unchecking the "email subscribe|newsletter" in your profile&nbsp;page on our Website, or by following the "opt out | unsubscribe" instructions that may be included in the emails you receive.</span></p>
<p><span>If you supply us with your telephone numbers, you will only receive telephone contact from us regarding your&nbsp;Website account. Except as specified above, we will not share your telephone number with other organizations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Please note that the date of the most recent opt in/out request will supersede prior requests. </span></p>
<p><span>Upon your reasonable request via our contact&nbsp;information&nbsp;(and subject to our security practices), we will provide you with access to your contact information (for example, name, address, phone number), financial information, and transaction information. If you're a registered&nbsp;Website member, you can sign in and access your Website account information from the Website&nbsp;Accounts page.</span></p>
<p><span>Upon your reasonable request via our contact information&nbsp;(and subject to our security practices), we also offer you the ability to correct inaccuracies in your contact information, financial information, unique identifiers, transaction information, and any communications that you have directed to our Website. If you're a registered&nbsp;Website member, you can sign in and correct your personal information from the profile page on our Website.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Security</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Any&nbsp;account on our Website you may have is password-protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Our Company will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. </span></p>
<p><span>We have instituted security measures in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you. In addition, we always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving important customer data exchanged with our Website.</span></p>
<p><span>Please keep in mind, however, that no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit using our Website, and you transmit such information at your own risk.&nbsp;Our Company&nbsp;further does not assume responsibility for use or disclosure of your information that are the result of unauthorized or illegal access to our systems or those of our vendors or partners.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Contact information</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Inquiries and requests relating to&nbsp;our Website policy should be sent via the contact section of our Website.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>Policy changes</span></strong><span> </span></p>
<p><span>From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If we make such a change, we will post a notice on our Website home page, or notify you by email, at which time you will be able to "opt out" of these new practices by contacting us (using the contact information above). If you are concerned about how your information is used, please check our Website periodically to review our current privacy policy.</span></p>
