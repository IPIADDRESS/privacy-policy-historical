<h2>Part of Optimalprint's <a href="/terms">Terms and Conditions</a></h2><div class="clear"></div><br>
<div class="clear"></div><div class="tabsSepDotted"></div>
Optimalprint knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. By visiting our Site and any of the sites offered by Optimalprint, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. For question on the Privacy Policy please contact <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@optimalprint.com">privacypolicy@optimalprint.com</a>.
<div class="clear"></div><div class="tabsSepDotted"></div>
<h2 class="terms">Children:</h2><div class="clear"></div><br>
Optimalprint does not sell services for purchase by children. If you are under 18, you may use our services only with involvement of a parent or guardian.
<div class="clear"></div><div class="tabsSepDotted"></div>
<h2 class="terms">Information You Give Us</h2><div class="clear"></div><br>
We receive and store any information or content that you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as facilitating when you reorder print material, responding to your requests, providing our services (e.g., storage of picture, images and logos), and in other ways in communicating with you.
<div class="clear"></div><div class="tabsSepDotted"></div>
<h2 class="terms">Automatic Information</h2><div class="clear"></div><br>
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Websites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our Sites. Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) click stream to, through, and from our Website, including date and time. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
<div class="clear"></div><div class="tabsSepDotted"></div>
<h2 class="terms">Security of Your Personal Information </h2><div class="clear"></div><br>
Optimalprint is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
<br><br>
If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.
<br><br>
While there are always risks associated with providing personal data, whether in person, by phone or via the internet or other technologies, and no system of technology is completely safe or "tamper"/"hacker" proof, Optimalprint has endeavoured to take reasonable precautions which are appropriate to the nature of the information to prevent and minimize such risks in connection with your use of this site.
<div class="clear"></div><div class="tabsSepDotted"></div>
<h2 class="terms">Eligibility and Account Administration </h2><div class="clear"></div><br>
Optimalprint's policy is to request that "Minors" (the age of Minors is determined by local law where you reside) do not make purchases or engage in other legal acts on the Site without the consent of a parent or legal guardian, unless permitted by applicable local law.
You must be 18 years or older to create a user account on Optimalprint. By signing up for a user account you represent and warrant that you are 18 years or older and that you in addition have the right, authority and capacity to understand, agree and comply with these conditions and the Terms of Use.
<br><br>
When registering you must provide accurate, complete and true registration information. If you have been provided with a default password for registration we advise you to change it immediately for security purposes. Upon initial registration you will be asked to create a username and password, you will be responsible for keeping these confidential, and for all activities relating to your chosen username.
<div class="clear"></div><div class="tabsSepDotted"></div>
<h2 class="terms">Image Gallery</h2><div class="clear"></div><br>
Pictures, images or logos uploaded to your image gallery will be protected from any external access. To access them, you will need to enter your usename and password.
<div class="clear"></div><div class="tabsSepDotted"></div>
<h2 class="terms">Personal Information Shared </h2><div class="clear"></div><br>
We share information but only as described below. Otherwise we will not provide your personal information without your consent.
<div class="clear"></div><div class="tabsSepDotted"></div>
<h2 class="terms">Business Transfer</h2><div class="clear"></div><br>
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, if Optimalprint or all or substantially all of its assets were ever to be acquired, customer information will, of course, be one of the transferred assets.
<div class="clear"></div><div class="tabsSepDotted"></div>
<h2 class="terms">Advertisers</h2><div class="clear"></div><br>
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
<div class="clear"></div><div class="tabsSepDotted"></div>
<h2 class="terms">Agents</h2><div class="clear"></div><br>
We engage other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments, providing marketing assistance, providing customer services, sending postal mail and email to you, removing repetitive information from customer lists, and analyzing data. These persons have access to personal information needed to perform their functions. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information that you provide to Optimalprint for any secondary purposes.
<div class="clear"></div><div class="tabsSepDotted"></div>
<h2 class="terms">Compliance</h2><div class="clear"></div><br>
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Optimalprint, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
<div class="clear"></div><div class="tabsSepDotted"></div>
<h2 class="terms">Cookies </h2><div class="clear"></div><br>
A cookie is a small text file, alphanumeric identifiers, that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
<br><br>
Optimalprint Web sites use "cookies" to enable you to sign in to our services, help personalize your online experience and control the flow of the ordering processes by maintaining the state of your online transactions. By showing how and when our visitors use Optimalprint's Site, the use of cookies allows Optimalprint to continue to improve the sites. This site also makes use of cookies for website traffic analysis and anonymous demographic profiling.
<br><br>
If you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, you may set your web browser to do so, if your browser so permits. Please understand that if cookies are turned off, you may not be able to view certain parts of this site that may enhance your visit.
<br><br>
Some of our business partners whose content is linked to or from this site may also use cookies. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
<div class="clear"></div><div class="tabsSepDotted"></div>
<h2 class="terms">Spam</h2><div class="clear"></div><br>
This Site should not be used to send or use e-cards, e-mails, SMS or any other electronic documents in any manner that would constitute the transmission of Spam, SMS or unsolicited e-mails.

We receive and store any information or content that you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as facilitating when you reorder print material, responding to your requests, providing our services (e.g., storage of picture, images and logos), and in other ways in communicating with you.
<div class="clear"></div><br><h3 class="terms">Automatic Information</h3><div class="clear"></div>
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Websites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our Sites. Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) click stream to, through, and from our Website, including date and time.

<div class="clear"></div><br><h3 class="terms">Security of Your Personal Information </h3><div class="clear"></div>
Optimalprint is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
<br><br>
If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.
<br><br>
While there are always risks associated with providing personal data, whether in person, by phone or via the internet or other technologies, and no system of technology is completely safe or "tamper"/"hacker" proof, Optimalprint has endeavoured to take reasonable precautions which are appropriate to the nature of the information to prevent and minimize such risks in connection with your use of this site.
<div class="clear"></div><br><h3 class="terms">Eligibility and Account Administration </h3><div class="clear"></div>

We share information but only as described below. Otherwise we will not provide your personal information without your consent.
<div class="clear"></div><br><h3 class="terms">Business Transfer</h3><div class="clear"></div>
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, if Optimalprint or all or substantially all of its assets were ever to be acquired, customer information will, of course, be one of the transferred assets.
<div class="clear"></div><br><h3 class="terms">Advertisers</h3><div class="clear"></div>
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We engage other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments, providing marketing assistance, providing customer services, sending postal mail and email to you, removing repetitive information from customer lists, and analyzing data. These persons have access to personal information needed to perform their functions. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information that you provide to Optimalprint for any secondary purposes.
<div class="clear"></div><br><h3 class="terms">Compliance</h3><div class="clear"></div>
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Optimalprint, our users, or others.

You agree that delivery of any Product that is to be provided to the customer in an electronic format, shall be deemed to have occurred either (i) at the time we transmit the Product via email or other electronic communication addressed to the customer or (ii) at the time we transmit a notification to the customer that the Product is available for downloading from the Site.
<div class="clear"></div><br><h3 class="terms">Quantity</h3><div class="clear"></div>
You agree that there is a possibility of a difference of up to 5% between the ordered and the shipped quantity within a product and that you will not claim any compensation for this difference. Likewise, Optimalprint or you do not have the right to claim anything for any difference when the shipped quantity is greater than 95% of the ordered quantity.
<div class="clear"></div><br><h3 class="terms">Return Policy</h3><div class="clear"></div>
Once you have placed an order it cannot be changed.
<br><br>
If we deliver incorrect or damaged goods, or in the event that you discover any defect in the goods for which you require compensation or other remedy, you must report the defect within 14 days of the date you receive them, or as soon as possible thereafter by <a href="/feedback">contacting us here</a>. Please retain the original packaging in the condition it was provided. Please note that we cannot accept returns that are delivered to us by hand.
<br><br>
In the event of Optimalprint sending you a replacement for a damaged, defective or wrong item, you must return the item to Optimalprint within 30 days. Optimalprint reserves the right to charge the price of the replacement item to the payment card used for the original order if you do not return the original item to us within 30 days of the date on which Optimalprint confirms we will issue a replacement.
<br><br>
If you return an item/s to us using a pre-paid, personalised return label and the reason for the return is not because of an error on our part or because the item is defective, we will deduct the cost of return postage from your refund.
<div class="clear"></div><br><h3 class="terms">Refund</h3><div class="clear"></div>
Since Optimalprint products are all digital files and there are no means of any actual goods being returned to Optimalprint with the guarantee that the delivered files have been destroyed, therefore all sales are considered to be final and non-refundable once you have ordered. In the order process you will be displayed the opportunity of previewing the files to be printed without additional cost.
<br><br>
To calculate the total amount that will be deducted from your refund, add the "per item" rate for each item you return to the highest "per package" rate applicable to the items in each package you send. If you return items in different packages, you will be charged a separate "per package" rate for each package.
