					<p>Optimost LLC ("Optimost") respects your privacy and we are committed to protecting it. We recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of the personal information we learn about you while you visit our site. This privacy policy lets you know how we will use and protect that information. The information that we receive depends on what you do during your visit, and what service(s) you request. </p>
					
					<p>
					<b>Non-Identifying Information</b><br>
					We may collect information about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information. This information helps us evaluate and improve our site and is sometimes useful for marketing and investment analysis.  The non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners of Optimost on an anonymous basis.</p>
					
					<p>Information gathered will include the following, but not limited to; the visitors' browsers use when viewing the site, site path of visitors, and the time visitors come to our site. Optimost reserves the right to publish anonymous, aggregate summary information regarding its site visitors. Please note that this is not personal information, only general summaries of our visitors.</p>
					
					<p>In addition to this site, Optimost operates its own venues ("Optimost Properties"), and collects information at those venues. As a part of the registration process at the Optimost Properties, we may request and collect additional non-personally identifiable information about the visitor. Examples of the non-personally identifiable data that may be requested include age, gender, and interests. None of the foregoing information (collectively referred to as "non-personally identifiable data"), by itself, or together, can by its nature be tracked to a specific individual.  In addition, web surfers who have provided registration data may elect to have their data deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by contacting us. Personally identifiable information that is collected at the Optimost Properties is discussed below.</p>
					
					
					<p>
					<b>Use of "Cookies"</b><br>
					Cookies are small files Web sites place on your hard drive that allow sites to identify you. The use of cookies is a standard and common practice of many Web sites. For example, if you allow a site to remember your login name or password, the site places a cookie on your computer. Cookies cannot read any other information on your hard drive. Optimost may place cookies on your computer to allow us to identify you. We may use cookies to measure web traffic, to offer you certain services and to customize your visit. However, if you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, your browser may permit you to do so. </p>
					
					<p>You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. For more information on how to modify your browser settings to block or filter cookies, see <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/">http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/</a>.  However, note that if you reject some or all cookies, your experience at our sites and on other sites throughout the World Wide Web may not be complete. Some sites require cookies to function, such as those with e-commerce features. In addition, if you do not allow cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of personalized content delivery offered by us or other Internet sites.</p>
					
					<p><b>Third Party Cookies At Our Sites</b><br>
					Some of the content displayed on our sites may be provided by outside companies. This content may contain cookies. The use of cookies sent by third party servers is standard in the Internet industry. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies may be served by our clients as well. We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain; please contact the respective outside company for more information on these cookies. </p>
					
					<p><b>Web Beacons</b><br>
					Our Web pages and the Web pages of our Optimost clients contain electronic images (called a "single-pixel gif" or "web beacon") that allow us to count page views or to access our Optimost cookies. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are typically very small, 1 by 1 pixel size, banner like files, but their presence can be easily seen within Internet Explorer by clicking on "View" and then on "Source." Web beacons are so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content. We also may include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters containing graphics that we send to subscribers in order to count how many newsletters have been read. In addition, some advertising networks that serve ads on our Web sites may use web beacons. Our web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any personal information about our Web site visitors, they are just the technique we use to compile our anonymous, aggregated statistics about website usage.</p>
					
					<p><b>Personal Information</b><br>
					At some Optimost Properties, including this one, Optimost collects personal information on individuals and companies who want to enter into business relationships with Optimost ("business information"). An example of this would include Web sites who want to use Optimost's technology on their site. We maintain business information for purposes of administering the program, such as maintaining account information, sending payments, etc. </p>
					
					<p>Additionally, at some of the Optimost Properties, we may ask people to register and provide personally identifiable data.  Examples of personally identifiable data that may be requested include name, address, and email address. web surfers who have provided personally identifiable data may elect to have their data deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by contacting us via the <a href="/contact_us.phtml">Contact Us</a> page or the methods outlined below.</p>
					
					<p>With respect to personally identifiable information, Optimost may, from time to time, provide information to certain third-party administrative vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative services such as billing, delivery and pay-outs, or for other services related to providing an Optimost product or service.</p>
					
					<p>Optimost may also share personally identifiable information with third parties who enter into business relationships with us. These business partners may include financial service providers (including credit bureaus and insurance agents); non-financial companies (including retailers, online and offline advertisers, membership list vendors, direct marketers and publishers); companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, and others such as non-profit organizations. We may also disclose information to a third party who provides substantially similar services as the original service signed up for, if we decide to stop providing such services ourselves. </p>
					
					<p>Optimost allows consumers who have voluntarily provided personally identifiable data access to their data to ensure that it is correct and to make any changes. Please contact us via the <a href="/contact_us.phtml">Contact Us</a> page or via the methods outlined below.</p>
					
					<p><b>Legal Disclosures</b><br>
					There are certain situations where we may disclose your personal information to others without first receiving your consent.  These may include: (1) when legally ordered to do so by a lawful subpoena or court order, (2) if you violate or breach an agreement with us, (3) if we believe conduct by you will harm the property or rights of Optimost or those of Optimost's clients, (4) under exigent circumstances to protect the physical safety of Optimost, its employees, users or the general public, (5) in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of our company's assets or the sale of an entire Web site or business division or (6) in order to validate credit card numbers for charging for fee services.</p>
					
					<p><b>Unsolicited E-mails Received by You</b><br>
					Optimost does not send unsolicited e-mails to non-public addresses or to anyone who has requested we do not contact them. Any newsletters that we send are only sent to those who have taken steps to subscribe for them at one of our Web sites. To stop receiving e-mails or newsletters from Optimost, either click on an unsubscribe link on the email or newsletter itself or send a request to be unsubscribed to

					<p><b>Security</b><br>
					Optimost makes significant efforts to maintain the security of its network and the data we collect. All information we receive is stored in a physically secure, environmentally controlled location, to which only limited, authorized  personnel have access. All networks are protected by physical Firewall technology. System access is only available to authorized Operations personnel, who use traditional UNIX authentication processes for access to production systems.  </p>
					
					<p>We use various technologies, including, in certain instances, encryption, to ensure the high security standards. Any data that is stored on Optimost's servers is treated as confidential and is not generally available to the public. Optimost limits access to such data to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such information for the purpose of performing their jobs. Please keep in mind, however, that the Internet is not a 100% secure medium. Therefore, although we use reasonable efforts to protect information, the possibility of somebody defeating our security measures does exist.</p>
					
					<p><b>Linked Sites</b><br>
					Our site may link to other sites not controlled by Optimost. Although we exercise much diligence in the selection of our strategic service and technology partners, we are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of any other Web sites. </p>
					
					<p><b>Third-Party Partners</b><br>
					Optimost works with several third party hosting services, including Akamai and Logicworks to host our web servers.  This type of relationship is common in the delivery and administration of services such as Optimost.</p>
					
					<p><b>Children's Privacy</b><br>
					Optimost is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy.  If you believe your child has provided Optimost with personally identifiable data, or registered at one of the Optimost Properties, and you would like to have the data removed, please contact us via the <a href="/contact_us.phtml">Contact Us</a> page, or via the methods outlined below. </p>
					
					<p><b>A Special Note About the European Union</b><br>
					European Union web surfers understand and consent to the processing of personal information in the United States. </p>
					
					<p><b>Terms of Use</b><br>
					The materials on this site are provided by Optimost LLC ("Optimost") for informational purposes only. By downloading any material from the site, you agree to certain terms. For complete information, please see our Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>
					
					<p><b>Transfer of Information</b><br>
					In addition to the above, there is also the possibility that Optimost, or part(s) of the company, may one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company. If that's the case, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to your information.</p>
					
					<p><b>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</b><br>
					The issue of privacy is an evolving one. Optimost is committed to the constant monitoring and examination of its privacy practices, and may, from time to time, institute changes to its Privacy Policy. In the event that any material changes are made to the company's privacy practices, we will promptly make changes to this privacy policy that discloses the changes.</p>
