              <p><span style="font-family:Arial">Options University&nbsp; strives to offer 
                its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an 
                interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally 
                Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, 
                telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. </span></p>
              <p align="center" style="text-align:center"><b> <span style="font-family:Arial;">We will never sell, barter, or

              <p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">How we gather information from users</span></b></p>
              <p><span style="font-family:Arial">How we collect and store information 
                depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to 
                participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to 
                provide information when you register for access to certain portions of 
                our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make 
                a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in 
                sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other 
                interactive areas of our site. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family:Arial">Like most Web sites, OptionsUniversity.com 
                also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic 
                tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the 
                name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to 
                recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, 
                the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having 
                to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the 
                number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting 
                our site. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family:Arial">As we adopt additional technology, we 
                may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can 
                choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your 
                browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to 
                access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user 
                name and password, and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features 
                according to your preferences.

                information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content 
                and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information

              <p><span style="font-family:Arial">Aggregated Information (information 
                that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For

                information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and 
                services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are 
                most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with 
                our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not 
                include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone 
                to identify you individually.</span></p>
