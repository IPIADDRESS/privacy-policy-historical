</div>
<div class="text parbase section"><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>We recognize that the privacy of your personal information is important to you.&nbsp; The purpose of this Website Privacy Policy is to let you know how we handle the information we receive from you through this website. Portions of this website may describe additional privacy practices applicable to specific types of information or to information provided on specific Web pages. </p>
<p>This Website Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through other means such as by telephone or in person, although that information may be protected by other privacy policies. As used in this Website Privacy Policy, terms such as “we” or “our” and “Company” refer to Optum and its current and future affiliate entities, including our parent company UnitedHealth Group. </p>
<p>This site is intended for a United States audience.&nbsp; Any information you provide, including any personal information, will be transferred&nbsp;to and processed by a computer server located within the U.S.</p>
<h3>Cookies and Non-Personal Information</h3>
<p>“Non-personal information” means information that does not permit us to specifically identify you by your full name or similar unique identifying information such as a social security number, member identification number, address or telephone number. The Company uses various technologies, which may include “cookie” technology, to gather non-personal information from our website visitors such as which pages are used and how often they are used, and to enable certain features on this website. </p>
<p>“Cookies” are small text files that may be placed on your computer when you visit a website.&nbsp; Cookies may include “single-session cookies” which generally record information during only a single visit to a website and then are erased, and “persistent” cookies which are generally stored on a computer unless or until they are deleted or are set to expire.&nbsp; Your computer may permit you to disable cookies and similar items by adjusting your browser preferences at any time; however, this may limit your ability to take advantage of all the features on this website.&nbsp; </p>
One of the companies we use to gather non-personal information from our website visitors is Adobe. This information is captured using various technologies and may include cookies. You may opt-out of this aggregation and analysis of data about your visit to this site by Adobe by clicking on this link (<a href="http://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?omniture=1&amp;popup=1&amp;locale=en_US&amp;second=1&amp;second_has_cookie=0">http://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?omniture=1&amp;popup=1&amp;locale=en_US&amp;second=1&amp;second_has_cookie=0</a>).
<p>We may use and disclose non-personal information unless restricted by this policy or by law.&nbsp; Some examples of the ways we use non-personal information include:</p>

<h3>Your Personal information </h3>
<p>“Personal information” means information that specifically identifies you as an individual, such as your full name, telephone number, e-mail address, postal address, or certain account numbers. </p>
<p>This website may include web pages that give you the opportunity to provide us with personal information about yourself. You do not have to provide us with personal information if you do not want to; however, that may limit your ability to use certain functions of this website or to request certain services or information. </p>

    <li>To perform analytics and to improve our products, websites, and advertising. </li>
    <li>To comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal process. </li>
    <li>To protect someone's health, safety, or welfare. </li>
    <li>To protect our rights, the rights of affiliates or related third parties, or take appropriate legal action, such as to enforce our Terms of Use. </li>

    <li>As otherwise necessary or useful for us to conduct our business, so long as such use is permitted by law. </li>
</ul>
<p>We may use personal information to contact you through any contact information you provide through this website, including any email address, telephone number, cell phone number, text message number, or fax number. Please see the section below titled “Our online communications practices.” </p>

<h3>Sharing personal information</h3>
<p>We will only share your personal information with third parties as outlined in this Website Privacy Policy and as otherwise permitted by law. </p>
<p>We may share personal information if all or part of the Company is sold, merged, dissolved, acquired, or in a similar transaction. </p>
<p>We may share personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law or regulation. We may cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting activities that are illegal, violate our rules, or may be harmful to other visitors. </p>
<p>If you submit information or a posting to a chat room, bulletin board, or similar “chat” related portion of this website, the information you submit along with your screen name will be visible to all visitors, and such visitors may share with others. Therefore, please be thoughtful in what you write and understand that this information may become public.</p>
<p>We may share personal information with other companies that we hire to perform services on our behalf or collaborate with. For example, we may hire a company to help us send and manage e-mail, and we might provide the company with your e-mail address and certain other information in order for them to send you an e-mail message on our behalf. Similarly, we may hire companies to host or operate some of our websites and related computers and software applications. </p>

<h3>Website and information security</h3>
<p>We use a number of physical security (such as locks and alarm systems), electronic security (such as passwords and encryption methods), and procedural security methods (such as rules regarding the handling and use of information), designed to protect the security and integrity of information submitted through this website. Due to the nature of the Internet and online communications, however, we can not guarantee that any information transmitted online will remain absolutely confidential, and we are not liable for the illegal acts of third parties such as criminal hackers.</p>
<h3>Our online communication practices</h3>
<p>We send electronic newsletters, notification of account status, and other communications, such as marketing communications, on a periodic basis to various individuals and organizations.&nbsp; We may also send e-mail communications regarding topics such as general health benefits, website updates, health conditions, and general health topics.&nbsp; We offer you appropriate consent mechanisms, such as opt-out, for marketing and certain other communications.&nbsp; As examples, you may click on the opt-out button associated with the specific e-mail communication or contact us as described below in the section “Contact Us.” Please be aware that opt-outs may not apply to certain types of communications, such as account status, website updates, and other communications.</p>
<p>Most e-mail, including any e-mail functionality on our site, does not provide a completely secure and confidential means of communication. If you send an e-mail communication to us, it is possible that your e-mail may be accessed or viewed inappropriately by another Internet user while in transit to us. If you wish to keep your information completely private, you should not use e-mail. </p>
