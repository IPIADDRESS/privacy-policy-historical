You better refrain from making such a statement in front of the fashion freaks because they’ll just give you the look and say this poor non-liberated soul doesn’t know anything about fashion.

The evils that have taken over our social life can all be traced back to the lack of proper family socialization. People from good homes and decent families are supposed to maintain a certain standard of moral conduct. But when the family system is shaken to the floor you have no such discipline in society.

Remember you are not asking the employer for a favor rather you are offering them your service for which you should be paid.

This is because most good lawyers work in the biggest firms, which charge a lot. To counter this trend law firms have started operating with a small set up but the same quality services that you would get in the more established law firms.

The Internet however gives you an added benefit of searching for your particular news item of concern. This comes in very handy because on the TV you would be bound to the telecasting schedule of the news channel.

They then are dead and gone and times have changed and most of what they say doesn’t even apply to our lives anymore.

Our shameless politics and brainless bosses have made us sick of authority. It all comes down to the fact that the education we get out of our system is void of any value whatsoever.

The crops of varied colors and tastes are themselves miracles of nature that man benefits from.
