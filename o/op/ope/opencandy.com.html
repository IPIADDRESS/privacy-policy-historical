<h1>SweetLabs, Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>SweetLabs, Inc. (“We” or “SweetLabs”) know that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and We take your privacy seriously.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and other information We gather when you are accessing our website(s), including at <a href="http://www.opencandy.com/">http://www.opencandy.com</a> and at <a href="http://www.sweetlabs.com/">http://www.sweetlabs.com</a> (our “site” or “sites”). </p>
<p>In addition, this Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of Personal Information and other information We gather when you use any of our services or products, including the OpenCandy recommendation network and the Ignite installation utility.</p>
<p>By visiting our sites, or using any of our services or products, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Please note this policy does not apply to (and We are not responsible for) the practices of companies that We do not own or control or to individuals We do not employ or manage. When utilizing third party sites or software products, you should read the relevant privacy policies of those third parties for information regarding their privacy practices.</p>
<h2>1. SUMMARY OF OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>SweetLabs maintains or provides multiple sites, products and services.  To better explain what information We collect, and how We use the information We collect, We have broken out our Privacy Policy into the following sections: </p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#sec2">Section 2</a>:  WHAT WE COLLECT AND WHY.  This section explains what information We collect from: </p>
<p class="indent2">• <a href="#sec2a">users who receive software recommendations from the OpenCandy Network</a>;<br>
  • <a href="#sec2b">business partners who participate in the OpenCandy Network</a>;<br>
  • <a href="#sec2c">users who download third party software that utilizes our Ignite installer utility</a>; and<br>
  • <a href="#sec2d">visitors to our sites</a>.</p>
<p class="indent"> <a href="#sec3">Section 3</a>: HOW WE SHARE OR USE INFORMATION WE HAVE COLLECTED.  This section explains how We use your information, and why, as well as if and how We share your information. </p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#sec4">Sections 4-8</a>:  These sections discuss various topics, including how We protect any information We collect, how you can update any information you share with us, our compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, our storage and use of information from users outside the United States, and how We may alert you of any changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>2. <a name="sec2" id="sec2"></a>WHAT WE COLLECT AND WHY</h2>
<p class="indent"> <strong><a name="sec2a" id="sec2a"></a>a. USERS RECEIVING RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE OPENCANDY SOFTWARE NETWORK</strong></p>
<p class="indent2"><strong>If you are a user receiving recommendations through the OpenCandy Software Recommendation Network, We collect the following types of information</strong>:</p>
<p class="indent2">When you install third party software that has chosen to use the OpenCandy Software Recommendation Network, as part of the installation process a temporary file transmits anonymous, non-personally identifiable information regarding your computer system, such as the geo-location, time zone, language setting, software installed on your system including the operating system and default browser, as well as information regarding whether recommended software has been accepted, downloaded, and installed. Much of the non-personally identifiable information We collect is similar to the types of information that websites often collect through a browser. </p>
<p class="indent2">We utilize this information to ensure compatibility of recommended software with your computer system, and to help us improve our ability to provide consumers the best product recommendations available.  It is also SweetLabs’ policy to require our publisher partners to provide their customers (who receive recommendations from the OpenCandy Software Network) notice of SweetLabs’ end user license terms, including a link to our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="indent2">Please see our FAQs for <a href="http://www.opencandy.com/faqs/network-sdk-faqs/">detailed information about how the recommendation process works.</a></p>
