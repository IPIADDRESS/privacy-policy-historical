The ability for readers to leave comments in an interactive format is an important part of many blogs.Open source blog software is an extremely popular way to administer a website. Gone are the days of static HTML websites. With blog software, an HTML5 and CSS3 compliant website can be created in seconds and without any technical knowledge or experience in these modern web development technologies themselves. HTML and CSS novices with zero experience can build and operate their own blog or company website with blog software. Commonly called a content management system, a blog CMS typically provides a standard set of features that allow for easier website management.SettingsThis generally includes a settings panel, allowing you to adjust the website’s base URL, website name, link structure, and other essential settings.AppearanceIt also commonly includes an appearance panel where you can install a custom theme and make changes to the layout of the website. Appearance settings will allow you to change color schemes, the website’s logo, menu items, sidebar elements, and more.Pages and PostsOf course, most open source blog software also provides page and post settings, where you can add new pages or blog posts to the website. Here you can also edit existing pages such as making search engine optimization adjustments or adding additional content.MediaMost blog content management systems will also have a media panel, where you can upload and store media such as images, videos, and other file formats. This can be very handy for organizing and keeping track of uploaded media.PluginsPerhaps the most promising feature of blog software is the integration of a plugin system. Also called addons, open-source blogging CMS’ that utilize plugins allow you to extend the functionality of your website using installable plugins that have been developed by a community in support of the software. Blog content management systems often have very far-reaching development communities and millions of active users. These huge communities contribute to a free plugin database that becomes extensive and incredibly useful, as seen with popular blog software such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.While the software developers themselves encouraged this by creating a CMS that’s open source and easily customizable, they often do not contribute by developing free plugins themselves. Rather, they count on the community to support the blog software and continuously grow and enable new features for the platform through their contributions. You will often see significant commercial developments (paid plugins) that are dependent on the blog software and platform. WordPress has tens of thousands of plugins with more than a billion total downloads to date. Most of this is been achieved through its popularity and fast free plugin database, although many of its paid plug-ins have been considered significant successes.
What makes blog software superior?
One thing you may have noticed with modern blog software is that it’s the most popular among open source scripts and content management systems. In large part, this is due to the enormous growth seen in web development. As businesses and individuals recognized the ease behind installing and operating a modern-day website, its popularity grew. Suddenly, the DIY blogger became popularized and small businesses that didn’t have a significant budget set aside for web-based advertising were able to jump on board. Today, blog software continues to be superior in comparison to other open source platforms. However, website builders that offer a drag-and-drop customization process have grown significantly since their inception. In fact, many blog content management systems have been attempting to offer similar technology by providing drag-and-drop page builders through plugin installations.
How blog software extends beyond pages and posts
Blog software can accomplish more than your traditional blog post. Through the use of plugins and customized themes, a blog CMS can be used for news portals, real estate listings, classified ads, forums, dating websites, wiki pages, e-commerce shopping, and much more. Blog software has become the foundation to which many varieties of websites are built and today, it’s entirely possible to build any type of website on a blogging platform.
Is blog software free and where can it be downloaded?
Most blog software is provided completely free, it’s often open source and can be downloaded from the developer’s website. For instance, you can find WordPress at Wordpress.org, Joomla at Joomla.org, and Drupal at Drupal.org. These are the three most popular blogging platforms, all of which are free and easily downloadable, to be installed on a web hosting server.">Blog</a> (28)</li><li class="cat-item cat-item-25"><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/clan-cms/" title="A clan CMS or clan script allows you to build a website that acts as a headquarters and organization system for your gaming clan. It’s a communal website that enables clan member interactions, communication, and engagement with one another. It also offers administrational features that can be useful for clan founders, as well as content that clan members can find value in.Clan scripts provide many benefits over alternatives such as blog content management systems. It typically organizes some of the aspects of a gaming clan that are difficult to achieve in-game, offering a centralized location for all members. Many clans feel as if in-game features such as friend lists, platforms such as Steam, and consoles such as Xbox or Playstation, simply don’t provide a strong level of cohesion for their clan. A clan script or clan CMS creates that unified experience that is so desperately needed in a competitive organization.
Ranking Systems
While some games, platforms, and consoles do provide internal ranking systems, it’s not as effective as being able to create your own custom ranks and categories. An online system that provides military style rankings is ideal for a competitive gaming clan. With the ability to assign member privileges and individually adjust promotions and demotions, ranking systems offer clans structure and professionalism. Automatic promotions and website privileges based off ranks can be assigned.
Squads
As clans grow, the ability to create smaller squads is very important. A clan CMS allow squads to be created and maintained by clan members individually. Based off rank, members will be able to create and organize custom squads with individually assigned privileges for squad members. There is often even a new system and messaging channel allowing squad members to stay in touch. This allows members to create a more tightknit community and group of players within your clan.
Tournaments
Part of what keeps a competitive gaming clan going is the ability to create and organize tournaments with opportunities for awards and promotions. Tournaments are often the lifeblood of clans and it’s what unifies members and creates a brotherhood. Clan scripts and content management systems make managing tournaments easier with options for pools, random, and custom seeding. Tournaments can be performed within squads or individually.
Medals
Clan members want to feel as if they are working towards something that is bigger than themselves. The ability to compete for medals is very important and as the founder of the clan and website administrator, your CMS should offer this functionality. Medals can often be auto awarded based on the specific criteria you specify, such as number of days in the clan or number of recruits.
Communication
One of the most important features of a clan script or clan CMS is its communication enablement. Fortunately, most content management systems for clients provide public and clan-only news sections, forums, site-wide shout boxes, private messaging, and more. Communication is essential to any organization, especially competitive gaming environments. Clans benefit from the immense feature-set of clan scripts.
Member Management
One of the best parts about a clan CMS is its ability to promote new member recruitment. Current members will feel far more obligated to benefit the clan by recruiting new members when they are rewarded for doing so. The medals and promotion system help to create an environment that encourages action. Members can easily recruit and add new members (at a rank below them) to the system. You as the founder get to decide what rank will enable this recruitment ability and you can create sign-up forms with automatic or admin-only approval. With custom profile options, members will feel appreciated and valued to be a part of the organization.
Custom Page Creation
Of course, every great content management system should provide the ability to create custom pages. This allows you to use a WYSIWYG style page editor to create and format pages however you want. Pages can be created to accept user input with submission forms, as well as traditional pages with text and other media such as videos, infographics, images, and more.Clan scripts and content management systems ultimately help you as the founder administer the website. Many clan CMS’ allow you to view website audit logs, customize specific functions and features of the website, set up member-only pages, and even access the HTML and CSS that powers the pages. These are features that should come standard with any open source script, as well as paid scripts and content management systems.">Clan CMS</a> (4)</li><li class="cat-item cat-item-18"><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/cmf/">CMF</a> (1)</li><li class="cat-item cat-item-3"><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/cms-software/" title="A content management system (CMS) is a computer application used to create, edit, manage, and publish content in a consistently organized fashion. CMSs are frequently used for storing, controlling, versioning, and publishing industry-specific documentation such as news articles, operators' manuals, technical manuals, sales guides, and marketing brochures. The content managed may include computer files, image media, audio files, video files, electronic documents, and Web content.Content management software is what powers many of today’s biggest websites, providing the essential framework to create, modify, and administrate a website. It’s often the underlying framework for small business websites, giving webmasters the ability to create and edit pages, blog posts, plugins, and other essential elements of a website. However, these features differ depending on the CMS in use.You can envision content management software as a complex system of website administrative features that don’t require an understanding of HTML or CSS to be used. They make it possible for the average business owner to manage their own website and avoid costly website maintenance services.Every CMS is unique and provides its own advantages and disadvantages, which gives website owners the opportunity to choose the best system for their needs. Additionally, some content management software is opensource and can be customized. Many have their own community of developers that contribute to the software by creating free themes and plugins.
Content management systems encompass all website management software
Something that’s unique about content management systems is that it’s a broad category that encompasses a wide variety of website management tools, including the most popular of these tools, blog software. Thanks to WordPress and other CMS’ under the blog software umbrella, like Joomla, you’re probably already familiar with what these tools do. WordPress has become the most dominant of all content management software with over 50% of the total market share and Joomla being the next closest at just 6%.However, because content management software is a globally applied category, that means e-commerce systems like Magento and Shopify, or forum systems like vBulletin and PHPBB, are all considered a CMS. Any software that allows content to be managed online is technically a content management system.The features and usage of CMS software varies widely because of this. There’s no standard feature-set for content management software. Although all these systems are designed to allow for the creation, modification, and display of digital content, they don’t all work in the same way. As is the case with e-commerce and forum systems, some CMS’ are designed for other types of unique media such as video content or graphics. Many others are geared toward traditional text-based content such as blog articles.
What does content management software typically do?
Content management software does have features that are relatively common across all systems. This of course includes the already referenced features of adding and modifying web content but there are many other features that are common to find as well.
Multiple Users
Most CMS’ support collaboration by allowing user accounts to be registered with differing permission levels assigned. This allows for admin accounts, user accounts, and staff accounts.
Search Engine Optimization
Content management software should also provide search engine optimization features, such as SEO-friendly URLS. Additional SEO features are sometimes accessed through plugins or addons for some systems.
Modularity and extensibility
Extending your website with a breadth of new features is generally possible through extensions, often called plugins or addons. These are easily downloadable enhancements that serves as modular installs. Within a few minutes, free plugins can dramatically change a content management system and add new features to the software that are unique and catered to your specific needs.
Appearance and templates
Most content management software allows you to change the layout of the website, the color scheme, and other basic appearance settings. Many systems provide themes that can be easily installed to quickly change the entire front-end appearance of the site without having to touch HTML or CSS code. They often come with an extensive back-end editor where you can customize the theme’s settings.
Upgrade functionality
All content management software must be updated over time for security and improvements. As these upgrades are released, it’s important that the system provide a wizard to easily install the new changes. Keeping your content management software up-to-date is important to preventing security breaches, hacks, and other malicious attacks.
Auditing and logs
Knowing exactly what went wrong when there’s an error or break in your website is important to implementing a fix. Proper logs allow you to view error messages and crash reports during your audits. This is essential to a content management system as it allows webmasters to diagnose and fix issues with the website, without the problem escalating and becoming more troublesome to front-end or back-end users.
Compliance with standards
Standards such as WAI-ARAI and HTML5 and CCS3 compliance is important to browser compatibility and security. Content management software should provide this compliance out-of-the-box.
Why consider a CMS?
Content management software should be considered for its many advantages over raw HTML and CSS. This includes the reduced need to code a webpage from scratch, the ease in creating a unified website, control over versions and updates, and the ability to assign permission level and manage users. Content management systems have become the most popular way to build and maintain a website.">CMS / Portals</a> (342)</li><li class="cat-item cat-item-17"><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/crm/" title="CRM software helps you manage the customer relationship process. If you’re a business-to-business company, you probably already know exactly what CRM software does because your sales team likely struggled with this at one point or is struggling now. The importance of customer relationship management it can never be overstated because it’s such a crucial process to prospecting, onboarding, and following up with clients.
CRM tools have a broad set of applications, covering everything from automating the adding of contact and company info, automatically logging meetings and sales phone calls, and organizing file uploads on a per customer basis. Customer relationship management is equally about tracking lead opportunities, which is why most CRM tools have a heavy focus on tracking sales leads and organizing where those prospects are at in the process. This makes it easy to follow up based on genuine data. CRM software also does some of the advanced metrics such as email tracking, link tracking, and website tracking. This allows you to get to know your customers inside and out and leverage your data in real time.Let’s explore some of the unique features of CRM software and how these tools can benefit your business going forward:
Centralized file access with dedicated document libraries
When you’re communicating with potential customers or current clients, you commonly need to access the same files and as much as Dropbox or Google drive is helpful, it’s not an end-all solution. Most CRM software provides centralized file access with dedicated document libraries where you can upload commonly needed files. This gives you on the go access to the files you need, reducing your customer service time and improving your overall efficiency.
Account and contact automation
If you’ve ever run into a scenario where you had to add account or contact details to multiple tools that your business uses, then you know the struggle of not having CRM software. When you download and use CRM tools, your account and contact details are automatically added as leads are uploaded to the system. This simplifies the entire process and through integrations with automation tools like Zapier, this can be streamlined even further.
User access based on roles
Within your sales team, you probably have in-house employees, contracted labor, and of course customer accounts. Giving these different roles the same set of access to your CRM software could lead to data breaches and high levels of access for individuals where it’s not needed. Role-based user access simplify its this process and applies need-to-know access and security throughout your CRM software.
Opportunity tracking
Leads come in all shapes and sizes and they also bounce around between your different sales stages. It’s important to track leads and know where communication is at and at what level within the sales pipeline at all times. This allows you to stay on top of your most important opportunities and audit your sales team to see how individual members are performing. Opportunity tracking is essential to closing deals and bettering your onboarding process.
Workflow automation and task tracking
Staying on top of important tasks is probably the most important but also the most challenging aspect of running a business. CRM software gives every employee within your business an opportunity to have their own task manager or they can prioritize and set due dates for important tasks. These tasks can be assigned to accounts, contacts, opportunities and even email campaigns. This gives every member within your business real leverage over their efficiency and productivity.
Email campaign automation
Have you ever started to write an email and decided you weren’t quite ready for it to go out to the customer? You saved it for a later date, only to forget to follow up on that email and ultimately, the customer was neglected. This is an unfortunate reality that businesses face far too often. Email campaign automation allows you to set and automate emails, sending them out at a time that’s right for your business. You can schedule follow-ups and create tasks to rewrite emails so that you and your employees are always on top of follow-up needs.Of course, CRM software also comes with advanced insights and reporting tools that allow you to view accounts, contacts, and opportunity tracking in real time. You can view your revenue, average sales cycles, average value per lead, percentage of won opportunities, number of new opportunities, expected revenue versus revenue goals, revenue this year versus previous years, top earning accounts, top lost accounts and the reasons for those losses, funnel analysis, and more. Reporting is how you gain ongoing value from CRM software and use it to improve the customer relationship process. This can be an immensely valuable tool to your business and your sales team. CRM tools are often open source and provided free to download.">CRM</a> (1)</li><li class="cat-item cat-item-12"><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/ecm/" title="Enterprise Content Management
The enterprise content management niche is worth $24 billion (USD) and is a rapidly growing category. It is well-regarded as offering businesses the ability to dominate in their niches and optimize every part of their operation.
By using world-class enterprise content management tools, methods, and strategies, it's possible to build a robust set of processes for all content-related decisions. Let's take a look at what ECM refers to, what it's used for, and the benefits it has to offer modern-day enterprises.What is Enterprise Content Management?
Enterprise Content Management or &quot;ECM&quot; is an organized method for collecting, managing, and sorting information. This information is designated for a specific audience (i.e. customers, businesses) and has to be systematically collected for optimized results.
Please note, enterprise content management software doesn't refer to a particular methodology, process, and/or technology. Instead, it is a refined combination of tools and strategies to maximize data. This can include preservation, storing, capturing, managing, and even delivering. Everything goes through a designated cycle before it is used for progressive purposes. ECM software is often integrated into a website CMS.What is ECM Used For?
1) Digitizing of Information
Imagine running a business and having a trail of contracts/agreements in place with clients. Having this information readily available and easy to access is essential. With the help of quality ECM tools, it's possible to digitally store this data and keep it on hand whenever necessary. If such processes aren't established, it's easy to lose sight of what's in place and what's not leading to ongoing inefficiencies.
Digitizing information is a major plus point whether it is storing files on hard drives, computers, or a separate server. The process also includes how the files are organized once they are situated on a separate drive. All of this can help run the business smoothly in the short and long-term.
2) Automation of Content-Related Decisions
Whether it's capturing, storing, finding, or delivering content, the business should be able to lean on specific steps to do so. This can include using search options or gaining access to a digital repository for all related content. This can include agreements, general information, research, or correspondence. Automation is the best way to make sure the content is actively managed and handled without dealing with long-term problems.
A business can also rely on using a solution that's convenient, safe, and offers long-term benefits. This level of automation is the best way to go.
3) Securing Content
It's one thing to optimize access to business-related content and another to make sure it's secure. ECM is a great way to keep tabs on what's going on and that's what businesses use it for. There is a realization that all content associated with the business will be kept in a safe spot and remain as secure as needed. With so many examples of hacks and other related issues, ECM is the best way to keep things in sync at all times.
Securing content is of utmost importance and helps keep the business chugging along at a fair pace.Benefits of Enterprise Content Management
1) Reduces Operating Costs
Operating costs are a big issue for businesses and it's a part of the process. However, content-related costs shouldn't tax the business and everything can be optimized with the right ECM approach.
For example, being able to transfer content from place to place digitally is a lot cheaper than paper-related transfers.
2) Increases Productivity
Being able to stay as productive as possible is of utmost importance and that's where ECM solutions come to the forefront. Productive solutions help set the tone and keep things as simple as possible for a business.
This can help save time in managing content and keeping it in a safe spot.
All &quot;low-value&quot; tasks associated with content management are processed without a problem and don't become a long-term issue for the business. This alone makes ECM solutions a must.
3) Increases Customer Satisfaction
A business is always going to rely on satisfied customers and will build processes to make sure this is the case. With the help of an ECM solution, it's easier to manage customers and keep them happy year-round. The solution is able to take away ongoing issues with managing documents, delivering documents, or even storing them in a safe spot.">ECM</a> (1)</li><li class="cat-item cat-item-5"><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/ecommerce-software/" title="Electronic commerce, commonly known as e-commerce or eCommerce, consists of the buying and selling of products or services over electronic systems such as the Internet and other computer networks. The amount of trade conducted electronically has grown extraordinarily since the spread of the Internet. A wide variety of commerce is conducted in this way, spurring and drawing on innovations in electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems. Modern electronic commerce typically uses the World Wide Web at least at some point in the transaction's lifecycle, although it can encompass a wider range of technologies such as e-mail as well.When viewing an online store, eCommerce software is the framework or engine that’s powering those product categories and product listings. It’s the system that allows business owners to easily manage their product inventory, add products to the store, remove products, calculate shipping costs and taxes on the fly, and fulfill their orders as products are purchased.With the ever-growing popularity of buying and selling products online, eCommerce software and scripts have become increasingly high in-demand. New technologies are driving software developers to create innovative and complex feature-sets for their tools, including eCommerce systems that piggy-back off important technology such as mobile commerce, supply chain management, electronic funds transfer, SEO friendly URLS and internet marketing, online transaction processing, automatic data collection, and inventory management. These are just some of the many useful technologies that eCommerce software utilizes and it’s what has kept opensource eCommerce scripts thriving.
What makes eCommerce software useful?
By simplifying the complex processes involved in running an online store, eCommerce software makes running an eCommerce business easier. It provides a user-friendly interface to access the intricate features of the script. Today’s eCommerce systems are very advanced, multifaceted tools. However, to the administrator, everything is easy to access and streamlined. Adding, editing, or removing products takes just seconds. Changing prices, product settings, or even store-wide settings is easier and code-free.
Opensource eCommerce software is often self-hosted
Most of the time, an opensource script is self-hosted. That means it must be installed and managed on your own server or web hosting provider. This is often preferred among developers or those with a baseline of technical experience. Often, you will have to do your own troubleshooting and updating for the software. However, it also means you have access to the opensource code and are able to make changes and customize the platform to your needs.
What about SaaS?
SaaS or software as a service solutions are sometimes still opensource but it’s a rare find. These are packages that you subscribe to on a month-to-month basis. You’re provided a secure installation and hosting service for the eCommerce software of your choosing. Generally, updates are automatically installed for you and it’s far more hands-off. Many eCommerce software developers have gone this route for providing their system.
What can eCommerce software do for your website and store?
In almost all eCommerce scripts, including opensource and SaaS, there are some essential features that you can expect to find. The common feature-set for eCommerce software is straightforward but it’s generally extendible through plugins and addons. Modular extensibility is often a priority among eCommerce software developers. Providing store owners with additional features that are unique to their store’s requirements allows their system to be applicable for a wide-range of industries.Automate shipping and taxes – Let’s face it, these are two expenses you probably don’t look forward to. Fortunately, eCommerce software automates your shipping labels, calculates your sales tax based on the location of the buyer, and sends email notifications automatically.Product management – The most important of all features for an eCommerce script is product management. From SKU handling to product variations, eCommerce software allows you to customize product names, images, prices and more using a simplified interface.Marketing management – SEO friendly URLs, easy meta-detail access, and other features make running an online store more profitable by getting you ranked in search engines.Order management – Let’s face it, setting up and managing the website is really the easy part. Taking orders, shipping products, and staying on top of order management is complicated. Your eCommerce software will make it easier, whether it’s an opensource tool or a SaaS subscription. You can filter orders, track order status, and make changes to your orders easily.Customer management – When you receive an order, it’s important for that customer to be added and tracked in your system. Customer management makes this possible. Many eCommerce tools even integrate with CRM systems to add customers into third-party software.Provide a better user experience – Ultimately, your success is about how well you impress the buyer and provide a good experience. Shopping cart software helps you do that efficiently. It makes the checkout process easier and helps customers find the products they’re looking for in real-time.">eCommerce</a> (21)</li><li class="cat-item cat-item-4"><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/forum-software/" title="An Internet forum, or message board, is an online discussion site. It is the modern equivalent of a traditional bulletin board, and a technological evolution of the dial-up bulletin board system. From a technological standpoint, forums or boards are web applications managing user-generated content.People participating in an Internet forum can build bonds with each other and interest groups will easily form around a topic's discussion, subjects dealt within or around sections in the forum.Forums are a community where online discussions take place and forum software is what powers these communities. It provides the website framework and makes a forum easy to manage for webmasters.
Forum functionality
With forums, conversations or topics are called threads and replies are posted on the forum as posts. In this sense, forums are a collection of threads and posts that are organized within specific categories that the forum owner or webmaster has created. These categories correspond to the different conversation areas that users may want to engage in discussion about.Forums are unlike online chat rooms. Rather, a thread (topic) can be much longer than your typical few lines of text like you might see in a chat room. Forums also come with user access levels and sometimes, threads (topics) and even posts (replies) will need to be approved by a moderator before going live and being visible to the community.One of the most popular forums is Reddit, crowned the front page of the internet. What made Reddit so unique was the ability of its forum users to create their own SubReddits, which are essentially entire forums of their own accessible under a single platform. However, this doesn’t mean that Reddit ended all other forums. In fact, tight-niche communities built on forum software are still growing rapidly.
What is forum software?
Forum software is what enables website owners and webmasters to install and operate their own online forum. There are opensource forum scripts like PHPBB as well as commercial software that comes at a premium price like vBulletin. There is even some forum software provided as a SaaS subscription.
How does forum software work?
As explain previously, conversions or topics are called threads. Typically, when a member of the forum has something to discuss, they will create a thread for it. They do this only after they have chosen the appropriate category within the forum. As the thread starter, they are able to create the first post within the thread which will appear at the top and all further posts (replies) will be displayed chronologically below this. This system also comes with some unique features such as thread “bumping,” which means that when a user posts something to the thread, that thread is bumped to the top of the listings within the category it was posted to. Additionally, threads can be “stickied” within categories and those threads will always display at the top regardless of the last time a user posted.
What are the common features of forum software?
Forum software comes with a lot of prepackaged features that can be useful to your community. It’s not just about threads and posts. Here are some of the common features that typically come standard with any opensource or SaaS forum script:
Users and group permissions
Just as new users can register to join the community, they will also be placed into a default group with a certain permission level. This is incredibly useful to the forum owner as it allows basic permissions to be widely applied to all users, granting moderator and administrator access to staff and above. On some forums, moderator privileges are provided to highly active users that wish to become a part of the management team.
Private Messaging
Almost all forum software comes with the ability to send private messages. This allows users to engage in private conversion on matters that don’t pertain to a thread or the community. It’s a useful feature that users will appreciate.
BBCode or HTML
Most forums accept either BBCode or HTML within threads and replies. This allows users to input images, links, and other important content onto your forum. Most forum scripts even have a GUI with a WYSIWIG editor for easily adding this type of content.
Emoticons
Now better known as emojis, emoticons are what people use to communicate and express feelings. It can make your board seem much more personal and it’s a great addition to have. Emoticons can easily be added to threads and posts through their equivalent text representations, such as :p for a small smiley face with its tongue protruding.
Polls
Forums are social communities and one way for your users to stay engaged with one another is to initiate a poll. It’s fun and it encourages interaction. Most forum software and website scripts provide poll functionality.Forum software comes in many varieties and there are plenty of opensource options. PHPBB has long been considered the best forum script but rivals like vBulletin have gathered dedicated fanbases.">Forum</a> (15)</li><li class="cat-item cat-item-23"><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/groupware/" title="Collaborative software (also referred to as groupware or workgroup support systems) is software designed to help people involved in a common task achieve their goals. Collaborative software is the basis for computer supported cooperative work.With the globalization of workforces becoming the new normal, it's important for businesses to remain in contact with employees and partners. Many businesses do this through solutions such as groupware software.Groupware software has become one of the most powerful solutions for modern-day enterprises and is often listed as a &quot;go-to&quot; option by successful leaders. Here is more on why groupware is essential and what it can do for a business in the long-run.
What is Groupware Software?
Groupware software acts as a collaborative solution to help connect people. These individuals can be in various parts of the world and this solution acts as a way to bind everyone's work together. One of the more popular forms of groupware is cited as &quot;synchronous groupware&quot; and is used for real-time collaboration.The uses for such tools can vary including collective writing, ongoing sharing of calendars, detailed database access, e-mail handling, remote meetings, and more. This software makes it easier to manage and/or display information for everyone to see at the same time.Some of the world's largest enterprises make use of collaborative software or &quot;groupware&quot; to help promote team-building and general efficiency.
Common Features of Groupware Software
The software will include a wide array of features to promote collaborative work. These features can vary from solution to solution but will offer improved productivity in the end.Some of the features include:* Communication (File Editing, Polls, Shared Task Management)* Authentication and Logging (Updated Logs)* Social Engagement (Profile Badges, User Groups)* Enterprise Knowledge Management (Protected Reference Documents, Internal Wikis)* Discoverability (Storage of Files, Access to Files)* Coordinated Workflows (Group Collaborations)These features are easy to integrate with the rest of the business and its operations. Users are able to gain access to these features and take advantage of them for personal and business-wide gain.
Benefits of Groupware Software
1) Promotes Communication
Communication between users is essential and should be as straightforward as possible. In some cases, traditional methods don't promote such communication and leave users in a confused state of mind. With the help of groups, profile badges, and more, everyone remains on the same page.This can help highlight potential flaws in projects and make sure everyone is on top of things from day one. This level of communication can make or break how well the business runs especially once the software is hosted on the business website. Users can quickly log-in, use the platform, and move forward with more information than ever before.
2) Increases Productivity
Projects can take time to develop and teams have to stay as patient as possible. With the help of world-class groupware software, teams can start to increase their daily results without unnecessary delays. Everyone can contribute, learn, and adapt without missing deadlines as listed beforehand.This can become important with larger projects where multiple people from various fields come together under one umbrella.

Many image gallery systems allow for commenting as well as other pertinent information regarding the image.Publishing pictures to your website can be difficult to do and that difficulty can get amplified when using an outdated or overly complicated CMS system. For example, with WordPress you will find it has media gallery ability, but it can be clunky and at times self-limited in what you can accomplish. However, if you are not using website software with an image gallery built in, you can get a dedicated image gallery program that will help you get images loaded onto your website quickly and easily.

Since the images are not stored using a raw file server, you do not have to worry about the website being loaded down with disorganized images. It creates a simplified interface to upload and store images. Most importantly, it helps you do this in a timely manner.Depending on the software you get, the gallery can help you find images you need from other websites as well. At the same time you will find the program helps you get the images organized in a folder on your CMS admin side, so you do not have to go and search for the images only to find out you cannot remember what you named the file.

So, you will not have to be concerned about going in and editing each individual image as you can optimize them and save them to the gallery in bulk. Then, when you need to use them, just select the image and it gets inserted into the position you need to have it at.
What Are Common Features of a Gallery ProgramThe most common feature is the ability to organize information on the images so you can remember where they are. This is something you will find helpful and it allows you to save quite a bit of time. That is because you will not have to spend all day trying to find a single image.What else is commonly seen with the software is the fact that it allows you to have the images optimized. You may have never thought about this before, but if your images are not optimized you could have some problems with the loading speed of your website or even worse, memory, if you are on a plan that offers a limited amount of storage and bandwidth.
How Does the Software Help You Out?The best part about image gallery software is you can use it rather easily to get images displayed on your website. This is going to help you save time by getting all the images in your website quickly and not fumbling over technical details such as image alt text, a requirement for strong search engine optimization. You don’t have to be concerned about the website having any issues for completing the post or page you are working on due to an image display issue or difficulty finding an image.Finding out that your website is going to need images and a way to display them when you don’t have such a system in place, can be daunting. This is not something that you want to overlook for any reason. However, image gallery software can make your life easier.

Many of us are already aware of this and are constantly looking for ways to continue learning. We all want to be our best. In today’s modern world where communication and access to information comes easy, a lot of people are turning to computers to help them learn about what they find interesting. However, instructors and those with the potential to teach are often lacking the technology to run an online educational platform. Learning software provides exactly what teachers need to deliver their content to students, provide a proper education, and ensure that their students will be able to retain the education they are getting. Therefore, it’s important to know what learning software is, how it will benefit you, the common features you can use, and finally how it will help you build a successful education company.
What Is Learning SoftwareIn the most basic terms, this is software that can be used to teach people.Learning software comes in a variety of options but it is typically delivered and created by the company or school behind the educational program. This can then be used to allow employees or students to sit down and watch the programs in video format, or read text, or even interact with the content. By using learning software, your students will learn more effectively, but also have the chance to go back on parts they were not clear about, providing a more impactful experience.
Benefits of Using Learning Software- Typically the software can be adapted to any system that is already in place. For example, if you are using this in a setting for addressing emergency plans you can have a program set up that will educate by using graphics, words, and even images to help you get your point across. This way everyone is going to know exactly what they are supposed to be doing at any given point in time. It integrates with your existing systems.- Depending on how in depth you want to get on the programs you can even have these set up to administer tests for people to take. You may think this will be pointless, but you need to realize this is not the case. In fact, these tests can help you learn more about the competency of the employees and if they get below a certain mark, it could be used to establish a reeducation on the same topic to help ensure everyone is passing and aware of what they should be doing.- With some learning software, you will find that it can allow for remote access for the employees. This is a great option for larger companies that have employees who are working all over the globe. By using these programs, the company can develop exactly what they are looking for and provide the proper testing for their employees, without them having to come to the office.
What Are Some Common Features?One of the common features of learning programs is that they can be adapted to your existing educational system. For example, if you want to set this up for students in high school, you can do this. However, at the same time, if you are working for NASA and want to have a program that is set up to educate the technicians on how the wastewater recycling system works on the space station, you can do this as well. Learning software is very versatile and it will make it easier for you to deliver your educational content in a streamlined way.
How Does This Help Businesses?Learning software is key to businesses in the educational space. The features it provides are beneficial to businesses and they are going to like that these programs will allow people to be trained at the same level. While a national company may have different instructors in different areas, they may not give the same message all the time or it could be taken the wrong way. Everyone learns differently, and a learning system allows you to focus on improving those different areas. With these systems in place, instructors are going to give the same message each time which will make it easier for the company to know all the employees are being trained at the exact same level.Finding the best learning software means comparing features, administrative backends, and the frontend learning portal. However, what you need to realize is how this software is going to help you out in getting the best results for your employees or students. As an organization, ease of use is important, but their experience makes all the difference.">LMS / LCMS</a> (5)</li><li class="cat-item cat-item-16"><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/mvc/">MVC</a> (2)</li><li class="cat-item cat-item-26"><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/social-dating/" title="Social dating has taken online dating platforms to a new level.

Wikis are often used to create collaborative websites and to power community websites. The collaborative encyclopedia Wikipedia is one of the best-known wikis. Wikis are used in business to provide intranets and Knowledge Management systems. Ward Cunningham, developer of the first wiki software, WikiWikiWeb, originally described it as &quot;the simplest online database that could possibly work&quot;.Wikipedia is the most illustrious example of &quot;wiki software&quot; and has gained critical acclaim. This wiki content management system is one example of what's now become a prominent content management option for businesses around the world.Here is why wiki software has picked up steam over the years and become a renowned option as an open source solution.
What is Wiki Software?
Wiki software refers to a systematic solution for collaborative purposes. The &quot;wiki&quot; enables users to set up and/or edit entries using a pre-determined platform. The number of users can increase without a page losing its integrity as a legitimate source.In general, a wiki system is hosted on its own web server for in-depth access. All information on the wiki is editable, secure, and consistent with the general theme. An entire project can be built on the software as multiple parties collaborate and share information in one place. This open script solution can be managed using various programming languages to customize the user experience.
Features include:
* Organizes Editable Information (New and Old)* Enables Entering of New Information (Directories, Apps, CMS)* Optimizes Management of Information (Search Options)* Enables Multi-Level Access (Rights Based on Role in the Project)* Establishes Consensus (Expression of Views)* Prevents Excessive Use of E-mailsWiki website software is present in public and enterprise settings with equal success. These features offer a tailor-made opportunity for larger groups to maximize their resources and collaborate without issues.
What is it Used For?
Wiki software can be customized depending on the user's requirements.* Public Facing Wikis* Private Enterprise Wikis* Personal WikisPublic facing wikis are designed to maximize and leverage a larger user base. This user base is comprised of writers/editors, and of course readers. While private enterprise wikis involve the use of data management for organizational needs. Lastly, personal wikis are designed for single person usage and can be run on a private device if necessary. Please note, some software options can be tailored to all three types depending on the wiki scripts.Each wiki script will vary offering its own list of benefits based on how it's used. Keep this in mind while setting up a new wiki.
The Benefits of Using Wiki Software
1) Helps Share Information
One of the primary benefits of a wiki website CMS is the ability to share information in a single location. Traditional solutions would often rely on e-mails and those can become tedious, overwhelming, and downright frustrating. Instead, wiki software is able to pass this information on without wasting time. Everything is accessible in one spot and helps keep things streamlined.This can become important while dealing with larger projects.A larger enterprise might have a project that involves multiple departments across multiple continents. This is commonplace with some of the largest companies on the planet and this is why wiki software offers value. It provides a one-stop solution for sharing, editing, and delivering information in a seamless manner. Everything is managed with the help of a high-quality wiki website script.
2) Simplifies Collaboration
Sticking the same example of a larger multinational company and its project-based needs, there is nothing more important than efficient collaboration. Such projects will have strict deadlines and several moving parts involving different departments. If each user doesn't do his/her part, the entire project can come to a screeching halt. With the help of wiki software, it's easier to collaborate without having to think hard.The user is able to log-in, take a look at recently edited content, and make amendments (with receipts) based on his/her editing rights. This enables continuous workflow from start to finish regardless of what day it is or what time it is.
3) Adapts to Various Programming Languages
One of the more underrated benefits of using wiki software is its ability to work with different programming languages. This open script solution can be tailor-made to work with various known programming languages without missing a beat. This can help manage tech-based projects that are reliant on specific programming needs.The user is easily able to manage the nuances of a database knowing the programming language is incorporated into the software itself. This level of control is highly beneficial in the long-term.">Wiki</a> (4)</li></ul></div><div class="widget widget_text" id="text-6"><p class="widget_title">Popular Demos</p><div class="textwidget"><ul><li><a title="WordPress" href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/wordpress/" target="_self">WordPress Demo</a></li><li><a title="Drupal" href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/drupal/" target="_self">Drupal Demo</a></li><li><a title="MODx" href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/modx/" target="_self">MODx Demo</a></li><li><a title="Typo3" href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/typo3/" target="_self">Typo3 Demo</a></li><li><a title="Joomla" href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/joomla/" target="_self">Joomla Demo</a></li><li><a title="concrete5" href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/concrete5/">concrete5 Demo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget widget_recent_entries" id="recent-posts-3"><p class="widget_title">New Demos</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/webedition/">webEdition</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/cuppa-cms/">Cuppa CMS</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/hhg-multistore/">H.H.G. multistore</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/shopware/">Shopware</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/laravel/">Laravel</a></li></ul></div><div class="widget widget_text" id="text-9"><div class="textwidget"><p><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/magazine/">Magazine Archive</a></p></div></div><div class="widget widget_nav_menu" id="nav_menu-2"><p class="widget_title">Popular topics</p><div class="menu-popular-from-magazine-container"><ul id="menu-popular-from-magazine" class="menu"><li id="menu-item-5775" class="menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-5775"><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/cms-market-share/">CMS Market Share</a></li><li id="menu-item-5778" class="menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-5778"><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/how-to-choose-a-cms/">How to Choose a CMS</a></li><li id="menu-item-5776" class="menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-5776"><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/content-management-systems-vs-frameworks/">CMS vs. Frameworks</a></li><li id="menu-item-5777" class="menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-5777"><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/free-website-hosting-plans/">Free Website Hosting</a></li><li id="menu-item-5779" class="menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-5779"><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/best-wordpress-seo-plugins/">Best WordPress SEO Plugins</a></li><li id="menu-item-5774" class="menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-5774"><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/magazine/">Show all topics &gt;&gt;</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget widget_text" id="text-7"><p class="widget_title">Blogroll</p><div class="textwidget"><p><a href="https://www.bauzins.org/">Bauzins.org</a></p></div></div><div class="widget widget_text" id="text-4"><div class="textwidget"><p><script async="" src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0633597942959738" data-ad-slot="4466754749" data-ad-format="auto"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></p></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="widget widget_text" id="text-3"><div class="textwidget"><div class="box"><p><span class="headline">Our Mission</span></p><p>OpenSourceCMS.com is a central resource for all things related to Open Source CMS and gives you the opportunity to “try out” most of the best Open Source CMS tools in the world without marketing fluff or sales people.</p></div><div class="box"><p><span class="headline">Featured</span></p><ul><li><a href="/about-us/">About Us</a></li><li><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/magazine/">Open-Source Magazine</a></li><li><a href="/cms-market-share/">CMS Market Share</a></li><li><a href="https://www.opensourcecms.com/open-source-vs-closed-source/">Open-Source versus Closed Source CMS</a></li><li><a href="/web-hosting-comparison/">Web Hosting Comparison</a></li></ul></div><div class="box line2"><p><span class="headline">About Us</span></p><ul><li><a href="/contact/">Submit Your CMS</a></li><li><a href="/contact/">Contact</a></li><li><a href="/image-credits/">Image Credits</a></li><li><a href="/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/imprint/">Imprint</a></li></ul></div><div class="clear"></div></div></div></div></div> <script type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */ var wpcf7 = {"apiSettings":{"root":"https:\/\/www.opensourcecms.com\/wp-json\/contact-form-7\/v1","namespace":"contact-form-7\/v1"},"cached":"1"};
