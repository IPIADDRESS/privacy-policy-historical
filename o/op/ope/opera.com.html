<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>The Opera browser offers you excellent features for the protection of your privacy 
and security when using Opera in the internet environment. Opera Software has also 
created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. 
This document refers to three distinct areas. Please note that  
personal information that is collected directly by Opera Software is not shared with 
any other parties.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#opera">Privacy in the Opera desktop browser</a></li>
<li><a href="#websites">Privacy on our Web sites</a></li>
<li><a href="#internal">Privacy of customer data</a></li>
</ul>




<h2 id="opera">Privacy in the opera desktop browser</h2>

<p>The advertising banner in Opera was first introduced with the launch of Opera 5 
in December 2000. All of Opera's desktop browsers now include this technology. Opera 
Software has taken much care in the development so that user privacy and security are 
not compromised. No personal information is collected or shared, and providing ad 
profile information in the browser is strictly optional. The Opera user's Web usage 
is not tracked. What is recorded and shared with the advertising service provider 
 
is the user's interaction with the relative banner advertising. Please see links below 
for more information about the company that provides the advertising in Opera.</p>


<h3>Opera's built-in Web search</h3>

<p>Opera has a built-in Web search feature introduced in Opera 5. This gives the user 
the option to utilize external Web search engines directly from the browser interface. 
Opera relies on third parties for this service. Follow the link below for more 
information about Opera's search feature.</p>




<h2 id="websites"><span id="lycos">Privacy</span> on Our Web Sites</h2>
