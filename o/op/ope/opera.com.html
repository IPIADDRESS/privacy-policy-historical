<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>


<p>The Opera browser offers you excellent features for the protection of your 
privacy and security when using Opera in the internet environment. Opera 
Software has also created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our 
firm commitment to privacy. This document refers to three distinct areas. 
Please note that personally-identifying information that is collected directly 
by Opera Software is not shared with any other parties.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#opera">Privacy in the Opera 5 and Opera 6 desktop browsers</a></li>
<!-- <li><a href="#opera5">Privacy in the Opera 5 browser</a></li>  -->
<li><a href="#websites">Privacy on our web sites</a></li>
<li><a href="#internal">Privacy of customer data</a></li>
</ul>


<h2 id="opera">Privacy in the Opera 5 and Opera 6 desktop browsers</h2>

<p>Introduced in Opera 5 was an advertising banner window in the program interface.
Opera 6 contains the same technology.
Opera Software has taken much care in the development so 
that user privacy and security are not compromised. No personally-identifying 
information is collected or shared, and providing ad profile information in 
the browser is strictly optional. The Opera user's web usage is not tracked. 
What is recorded and shared with the advertising service provider is the 
user's interaction with the relative banner advertising. The company which 
provides advertising services is <a href="http://www.cydoor.com/">Cydoor</a>. 
For more information see the links below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Overview: <a href="http://www.opera.com/privacy/adinfo.html">Privacy, Security, and Advertising in 
    Opera 5 and 6</a></li>
<li>Technical details: <a href="http://www.opera.com/opera5/ads.html">Advertising Implementation 
    in Opera 5 and 6</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Also introduced in Opera 5, and present in Opera 6 is a built-in web search
feature. This gives the user the option to utilize external web search engines directly from the 
browser interface.  Opera relies on third parties
for this service.  Follow the link below for more information about Opera's search feature.
