Except as explicitly provided herein, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of entities that we do not own or control or to people that we do not employ or manage.  Your privacy on the Internet is important to us.  Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, this Privacy Policy notifies you of:</p>
<ol>
    <li>What personally identifiable information of yours is collected through the Website</li>
    <li>Who collects such information</li>
    <li>How such information is used</li>
    <li>With whom your information may be shared</li>
    <li>What choices you have regarding collection, use and distribution of your information</li>
    <li>What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control</li>
    <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in your information.</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions regarding this statement should be directed to Opening Ceremony by emailing <a href="mailto:online@openingceremony.us?subject=Questions%20re.%20Privacy%20Policy">online@openingceremony.us</a>.</p>
<p><strong><br>
Your Consent</strong></p>
<p>By accessing any part of the Website or using its Services, the Website visitor or user (“you” or “your”) consents to and agrees with this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy is part of the Terms and Conditions governing your use of the Website and its Services.  Any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions of Use.  Please read the <a href="/termsandconditions.html" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>.  If you do not agree with any part of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website or the Services.<br>
<br>
Opening Ceremony reserves the right at any time and without notice to change this Privacy Policy simply by posting such changes on this page.  Any such change will be effective immediately upon posting.  Your continued use of any of the Website or Services signifies your acceptance of any such changes or revisions.

Please note that the use of information that we gather is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of use.</p>
<p><strong><br>
What information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>We collect information from you when you create an account on our Website, sign up for our newsletter or mailing list, make a purchase through the Services, fill out a form, transmit comments, contact us through the Website, or receive customer or technical support.<br>
<br>
When using the Services or creating an account on our Website, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your: name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number or credit card information.  You may, however, visit our Website anonymously.  The personal information that you provide must be true, accurate and complete, and all registration and account details (where applicable) must contain your real name, address and other requested details.  To update your personal information, please log into the Website and click on the “login” link.  You are responsible for keeping your contact information current and accurate.<br>
<br>
Please note that when you delete your registered account information (where applicable), we may retain your registration information for a reasonable period of time afterward for the purpose of internal account management and fraud prevention activities. <br>

How do we protect your information?</strong></p>
<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information.<br>
<br>
We offer the use of a secure server.

Any such transmission is done at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong><br>
Do we use cookies or web beacons?</strong></p>
<p>Our Website may use cookies, which are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computers hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enable the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information, and web beacons, which used to transmit information back to a web server.  For example, use of cookies helps us remember your password, and process the items in your shopping cart.  The majority of web browsers accept cookies, but the “help” menu on your browser should give you options for preventing, accepting, or receiving notice of new cookies.  However, please be aware that if you block cookies, some Website functionality may be lost.</p>
<p><strong><br>
Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</strong></p>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.

We also may share information with affiliated businesses which we do not control but with which we engage in joint and co-branded offerings and entities with which Opening Ceremony may merge or which may acquire all or substantially all of Opening Ceremony’s assets, as customer information likely will be one of the transferred assets.  We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our Website policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety.  Except as provided above, we will not share any of your personally identifiable information with any third party without your permission.  However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
