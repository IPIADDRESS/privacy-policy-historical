<p><strong>What information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>We collect information from you when you create an account on our Website or sign up for Services at a retail location, fashion show or promotional event; fill out a form and submit it to us in any manner; complete a survey for us; participate in a contest or other promotion sponsored by us or on our behalf; contact us; or otherwise use the Website or the Services, or provide information to us.</p>
<p>When using the Services or creating an account on the Website, you may be asked to provide your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, or credit card or other payment account information.  The personal information that you provide must be true, accurate and complete, and all registration and account details (where applicable) must contain your real name, address and other requested information.  You are responsible for keeping your information current and accurate.  We may combine information we collect from and about you online with information we collect from and about you through other means.  We may also combine your information with information we learn about you from other sources, such as account update notifications.</p>
<p>Please note that when you delete your account information on the Website, or terminate your use of the Services, we may retain your information for a reasonable period of time afterward for the purpose of recordkeeping, account management and fraud prevention activities.</p>
<p>In some instances, we may ask for contact information for people other than yourself including, for example, e-mail addresses of friends to whom you send gift cards, e-cards or a link to the Website, or the mailing address of someone you wish us to notify about the Services.  The information we collect is used to send the notification or information you request and/or to inform the recipient of Opening Ceremony updates and opportunities.  Such contact information is not shared with any other organizations, other than as provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Our Website may log certain non-identifying Website usage data, such as the number of visits to our Website.  We may also collect information about the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; connection information such as browser type and version, operating system and platform; other software and hardware information; and information about your browsing behavior, such as the date/time you visit the Website, the Website pages that you visit, the time you spend visiting the Website or viewing a page, the number of times you return to the Website, and other click-stream data.  We may also use third-party website analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) that collect information about visitor traffic on our Website and any mobile applications.  The information collected by such third-party tools may include gender, age, and prior activities on the Internet.  This information is used for internal purposes by Opening Ceremony to provide better technical support and may also be provided to others for support, marketing, research or other business purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.  We treat all information of the type referenced in this paragraph as non-personal, unless required by applicable law to do otherwise.  Additionally, any unsolicited information that you provide to us shall be deemed to be non-confidential, and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose and distribute such unsolicited information to others without limitation or attribution.</p>
<p><strong>What do we use your information for?</strong></p>
<p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:<br>
<br>
• To respond to your requests for Services and to keep you informed of updates about your account<br>
<br>
• To personalize your experience with the Website or the Services<br>
<br>
• To improve the Website and the Services<br>
<br>
• To improve customer service<br>
<br>
• To process transactions<br>
<br>
• To provide you with targeted offers, promotions and advertisements<br>
<br>
• To send periodic emails<br>
<br>
• To protect your rights, our rights and the rights of others</p>
<p>Once you create an account with Opening Ceremony, you may be included in our mailing list, and we may send you updates, newsletters, correspondence and other materials of this type.  If you do not want to receive these communications, follow the instructions provided in the “Opting Out” section below.</p>
<p><strong>“Opting Out” of Receiving Communications from Us</strong></p>
<p>If you no longer want to receive our e-mails, offers, updates on Services, or other communications, please send an email to unsubscribe@openingceremony.us or follow the “unsubscribe” instructions at the bottom of each email or communication.  Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain correspondence from us, including messages relating to your use of the Services.</p>
<p><strong>How do we protect your information?</strong></p>
<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information.</p>
<p>We offer the use of a secure server.  All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers’ database, only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, who are required to keep the information confidential.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no transmission of data over the Internet, and no system for storage of physical data, is guaranteed to be completely secure.  It may be possible for hackers or other third parties not under the control of Opening Ceremony to intercept or access private communications unlawfully.  While we strive to protect your personal information, Opening Ceremony cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit or otherwise provide to us.  Any transmission or other provision of information is done at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Do we use cookies, web beacons or other tracking technologies?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.  Our Website may use cookies (which are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer/hard drive through your web browser that enables the site’s or service provider’s system to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information), web beacons (which are used to transmit information back to a web server), or other tracking technologies, to improve and personalize the Website, as permitted under applicable law.  For example, use of cookies helps us remember your password, and process requests you make through the Website.</p>
<p>We may also work with third parties (such as Google Analytics) that use cookies, web beacons or other tracking technology to collect information about your visits to the Website and/or other websites, and to serve advertisements to you based on that information.  In particular, we may use third party cookies for the purpose of retargeting advertisements, meaning that after you visit our Website, you may receive future advertisements based on your activity on our Website.  The majority of web browsers accept cookies, but the “help” menu on your browser should give you options for preventing, accepting, or receiving notice of cookies should you wish to do so.  Please be aware that if you block cookies, some Website functionality may not be available to you.  Alternatively, you may opt out of interest-based advertising and retargeting by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page posted at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank" style="font-family: Merriweather, serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.7em; color: rgb(51, 153, 255); border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(51, 153, 255); text-decoration: none;">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Do we disclose your personal identifiable information to outside parties?</strong></p>
<p>We may share your personally identifiable information with trusted third parties who assist us in operating the Website, providing the Services, conducting our business, or servicing you, or to our affiliates or agents, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.
