<h2>Opera Mediaworks Services Privacy Policy </h2>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Effective: June 25, 2014</h3>
<h3>Last Updated: September 19, 2014</h3>
<p><br></p>
<p>Opera Mediaworks Inc. ("Opera Mediaworks" or "we", "us", "our") is a technology company that creates and delivers advertisements to mobile devices. This privacy statement ("the Policy") explains how Opera Mediaworks strives to collect, use and disclose information that may be personal in nature in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which it does business. To this end this Privacy Policy serves as our Safe Harbor Privacy Policy and sets forth the privacy principles that Opera Mediaworks follows with respect to the transfer of personal information from the European Union (EU) and Switzerland to the United States. If you have any concerns about this policy, or your privacy when your business or mobile device accesses our services, please send an email to <a href="mailto:priv%61cy@o%70%65ra%6D%65%64i%61wo%72%6Bs.%63o%6D">privacy@operamediaworks.com</a> and we will try to address it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p>This Policy applies to all personal information received by Opera Mediaworks in the United States from the EU, Switzerland and all other geographies in any format including electronic, paper or verbal.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
<p>The following definitions apply throughout this Policy:</p>
<ul><li>"Opera Mediaworks" means Opera Mediaworks Inc., its successors, subsidiaries, divisions  and groups.</li>
<li> "Personal information" When Opera Mediaworks uses the term personal information  in this policy, Opera Mediaworks is referring to information that specifically identifies an individual (such as an individual's name, address, telephone number or e-mail address), and information about that individual or such individual’s activities or preferences when such information is directly linked to personal information. Personal information does not include aggregate information, which is data we collect about the characteristics and activities of users of this Site and Opera Mediaworks's other services or the services of our customers, from which any personal information has been removed. This privacy policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information or of non-personal information.</li>
<li>"Sensitive personal information" means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or that concerns the individuals health or sex life. Opera Mediaworks does not collect “sensitive personal information”.  <br></li>
</ul><p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT OPERA MEDIAWORKS' PRIVACY PRACTICES</strong></p>
<p>Opera Mediaworks provides an advertising platform and advertising mediation service to interconnect mobile publishers with multiple mobile ad sources. Our Technology facilitates the efficient serving of advertisements within mobile messages (e.g. SMS), the mobile web, and within mobile applications by collecting information associated with these services that you visit or use and the advertisements that you see associated with such services. You may encounter our technology when Opera Mediaworks or one of our Business Partners places advertisements on a mobile web site or application that you visit or use. We use the information collected by our technology in order to help us efficiently deliver those ads, and for reporting purposes (e.g., to tell our partners how many ads we delivered in a day.)</p>
<p><strong>Ways we collect information.</strong></p>
<ul><li>Opera Mediaworks does not collect personal information directly from individuals but rather receives information via partners’ mobile messages, mobile web sites and mobile applications as well as from third party service providers (e.g., mobile carrier operators). In this light, Opera Mediaworks relies on our customer partners and these third party service providers to inform their users about the purposes for which they collect and uses their personal information, and that they may pass that information to us. To the best of our ability we inform our partners the need to offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their personal information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. </li>
<li>Consistent with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) without requiring parental consent.</li>
<li>When Opera Mediaworks receives personal information from the entities described above we will use such information only in accordance with the principles set forth here, the notices such entities provided and the choices made by the individuals to whom such personal information relates.  When our customer partner’s end users connect to the technical service on their mobile device, Opera Mediaworks may automatically receive from their mobile phone service provider or our customer partner information identifying the user’s unique mobile device, their phone number and/or other unique identifiers for their device (“Mobile Device Information”).</li>
<li> For the avoidance of doubt, our customer partner or mobile phone service provider privacy policies, and not this Privacy Policy govern any private information that is collected from end users.</li>
<li>Opera Mediaworks does use a “pixel tags" and/or similar technologies, in our communications to enable us to evaluate when and if advertisements are viewable on the mobile device. A pixel tag is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located within the advertising creative, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message.</li>
</ul><p><strong>What information is collected by our Technology and how is it used?</strong></p>
<ul><li> While Opera Mediaworks does not store or maintain personal Information via our technology, our technology does collect and use Non-PII, including: location and service provider information garnered via the IP address used to access the mobile Internet or other means, device identifiers, the type of phone or other mobile device used (e.g., iPhone, Blackberry 8800 etc.), the date and time of a user’s mobile internet session, whether one of the mobile ads we facilitate was delivered and, if applicable, a record if that ad was “clicked.”</li>
<li>Opera Mediaworks collects and retains information passed to us by our business partners as well as record of what application or website owned by our business partner collected the information.  For example, we may receive information about an individual’s age, gender and device ID (e.g., Android Advertising ID or Apple Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA)) along with a specific application name e.g, Pandora.  Based on the privacy rules of the application owner and their business agreement with Opera Mediaworks, we may integrate this information with that acquired from other application owners or websites.  This information is then used to deliever advertisements and promotional information to the specific device identified based on the individual’s online behavior.  This activity, called Online Behavioral Advertising is enabled by the information collected.
