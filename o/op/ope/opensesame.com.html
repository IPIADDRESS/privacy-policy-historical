                At Macromedia we respect your right to privacy and we understand 
                that, as a visitor to macromedia.com, you prefer to control your 
                own personal information and preferences. For this reason, we 
                may ask you to register or to provide personal information and 
                preferences when you visit certain areas of macromedia.com, download 
                free software, request information, or subscribe to Macromedia 
                Edge newsletter. 
              </p><p> We will guard the personal information you share with us to 
                ensure the content, services, and advertising that we provide 
                on macromedia.com are always tailored to your current, designated 
                preferences.</p>
              <p> When you provide Macromedia with your name (or alias), e-mail 
                address, mailing address, or telephone number, and you "opt 
                in," Macromedia and Macromedia representatives may use the 
                provided information to alert you to product upgrades, special 
                offers, updated information, classes, new services, and other 
                Macromedia information. ("Representatives" include value-added 
                resellers and authorized training partners.) Macromedia does not 
                offer, or allow the selling of, any user-provided information 
                to third parties.</p>
              <p> Macromedia respects the rights users give us when opting to 
                receive e-mail communications and enforces internal policies to 
                preserve those rights. It is our objective to retain the long-term 
                ability to continue to communicate with our users.</p>
              <p> If you do not want Macromedia or Macromedia representatives 
                to contact you, you may "opt out" of this preference 
                at any time, whether you're online or contacting Macromedia directly. 
                As part of your preference flexibility, you'll always have the 
                option to opt back in and have Macromedia contact you based on 
                your previous or new preferences. For instructions, please see 
                the section "Contact Us," below.</p>
              <p> If you choose not to register or provide personal information, 
                you can still visit most Macromedia websites; however, you will 
                not have access to areas that require personal identification.</p>
              <p> <b>Macromedia membership and the use of log files (cookies)</b><br>
                Macromedia offers free membership to all macromedia.com visitors. 
                In order to establish membership, visitors are requested to provide 
                both personal information and preferences. This information is 
                stored and protected by your user-established Member ID and Password.</p>
              <p> There is an additional "Remember me" option. By selecting 
                it, you allow Macromedia to save your Member ID so you don't have 
                to re-enter it each time you return to any Macromedia website. 
                Macromedia remembers you by placing a log file (cookie) that contains 
                only enough information to identify you upon return visits. A 
                "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with 
                your web browser for record-keeping purposes and helps Macromedia 
                provide better service to you. Your browser has options to accept, 
                reject, or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent.</p>
              <p> No information, other than that found in the Membership cookie, 
                will be accessed by any Macromedia system. Access to your membership 
                information always requires both your Member ID and Password.</p>
              <p>Macromedia also utilizes visitor log files (cookies) with our 
                website. Once a user enters our site, a cookie follows them through 
                their click stream path. Examples of information being collected 
                by these cookies include the number of times a user came to our 
                site(s), and the paths they took to get there.</p>
              <p>Macromedia uses the data collected from website visitor cookies 
                in aggregate form only and does not collect any personally identifiable 
                information. Use of this information helps us better understand 
                what users are seeking and learning at our website(s) and helps 
                us identify potential navigation issues.<br>
              </p>
              <p> <b>How Macromedia will protect your personal information</b> 
                <br>
                Macromedia will always protect the personal information that you 
                share with us. Macromedia stores information internally in a controlled, 
                secure environment. If, for example, you make a purchase online, 
                we route all transactions through SSL (Secure Socket Layers) and 
                will process your credit card number only to secure your current 
                payment. The SSL transaction does not retain your credit card 
                number subsequent to the transaction at hand and will not use 
                the number for marketing purposes.</p>
              <p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services 
                on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, 
                answering customer questions about products or services, sending 
                postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide 
                those companies the information they need to deliver the service, 
                and they are prohibited from using that information for any other 
                purpose.</p>
              <p>If Macromedia requests general demographic information, this 
                information is limited to reporting purposes only; members remain 
                anonymous. Phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and postal addresses 
                are never shared for demographic reports with outside entities.</p>
              <p>Macromedia may occasionally present a special contest or promotion 
                that is sponsored by another company. To qualify for entry, we 
                may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share 
                that information with the sponsor(s), we will provide an up-front 
                statement to that effect.</p>
              <p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may 
                need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein 
                we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply 
                with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process 
                served on our website.</p>
