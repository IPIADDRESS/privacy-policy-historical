The mailings are sent by a lettershop in Germany, with which there is an agreement for order processing according to Art. 28 GDPR. Otherwise the data will not be passed on to third parties.</p>
<p>18.2. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR (or before 25.5.2018: § 28 (3) p. 2 BDSG a.F ..)</p>
<p>18.3. The purpose of using mailings is to attract B2B new customers to our company. Our legitimate interest in the processing of personal data pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR. This is based on the following balance of interests:<br>
</p><ul>
<li>For consideration, recital (EC) 47 GDPR should be used: "The processing of personal data for the purpose of direct marketing may be considered as processing of legitimate interest." In addition, EC 47 DSG Regulation provides, with regard to balance of interests, "the reasonable expectations of the parties concerned Persons based on their relationship with the person responsible ". For the reasonable expectations of the data subject, especially Articles 13 and 14 GDPR are to be used. In addition, according to EC 47 GDPR, it must be considered whether the data subject is already a customer of the person responsible or uses his services. Finally, the "Principles for processing personal data" under Art. 5 GDPR are to be used.</li>
<li>We offer services and products for companies in the field of law, PR / marketing and home / garden. These help customers to advertise new customers or simplify their processes. Therefore, it is generally assumed that the customers will find our offers useful. We have an interest in advertising to new customers who are not existing customers. It is to be expected that new customers will also find the offers useful ("reasonable expectations of the persons concerned").</li>
<li>The interest in direct mail is also supported by the focus on B2B customers, where the selection criteria are based on information about the company, e.g. Law firms, and not individuals. No data are collected from the personal environment of the customers or from special categories according to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR. Likewise, no information from other sources such as social networks are taken into account or so-called advertising scores are created. The missing aggregation of selection criteria means a low intervention intensity.</li>
<li>Law firms must also publish their contact details in accordance with § 21 BRAO in the telephone directory in the context of the law firm's duty to register. a special interest in acquiring new clients. You have to make yourself "public" to make contact. This is comparable with other companies, which want to be reachable also for their customers, but also interesting offers. Therefore, our direct advertising measures are mainly used for offers for client / customer acquisition of those affected. Lawyers can count as entrepreneurs on the use of their data for the purpose of marketing due to the professional obligation to publish their contact.</li>
<li>Therefore, we also research addresses from publically accessible sources / directories or homepages of companies. There is no storage of further data.</li>
<li>On the other hand, there is little interest on the part of the person concerned, not to receive direct mail from us as a company not previously contracting with them. Industry-specific B2B letter advertising has only a minor impact on the business process an interest of the persons concerned suspect. It should also be borne in mind that the persons or companies concerned by the postal advertising can prevent the advertising by attaching a note to the mailbox that they do not wish to receive a sales letter, since the postmen are generally instructed to send the sales letter marked "Dialogpost" not deliverable. As a result, a burden on the office organization by the affected parties can be easily avoided in advance. Due to the obligation to pay, direct mail by mail is also generally smaller in numbers than by electronic means and therefore less burdensome. Finally, there is a right to object at any time under Article 21 (2) of the GDPR, to which the parties concerned must expressly be informed in accordance with Article 21 (4) of the GDPR. According to Art. 21 (3) GDPR, personal data may not be processed and used for advertising purposes if there is an advertising conflict. Therefore, an interest of data subjects or companies in the exclusion of data processing does not prevail due to the previous considerations.</li>
</ul>

<p>29.3. Google Marketing Services allows us to better target advertisements for and on our website so that we only present ads to users that potentially match their interests. If a user e.g. Showing ads for products he's been interested in on other websites is called remarketing. For these purposes, when Google and our other websites accessing Google Marketing Services are directly accessed by Google, a code will be executed by Google and so-called (re) marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also called "Web Beacons ") incorporated into the website. With their help, the user is provided with an individual cookie, i. a small file is saved (instead of cookies, comparable technologies can also be used). The cookies can be set by different domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.com or googleadservices.com. In this file is noted which web pages the user visited, for what content he is interested and what offers he has clicked, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring web pages, visit time and other information on the use of the website. The IP address of the users is also recorded, whereby in the context of Google Analytics we announce that the IP address is shortened within member states of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area and only in exceptional cases to one Google server in the US is transmitted and shortened there. The IP address will not be merged with data of the user within other offers from Google. The above information may also be linked by Google with such information from other sources. If the user then visits other websites, they can be displayed according to his interests, the ads tailored to him.</p>

<p>29.4. The data of the users are pseudonym processed in the context of the Google marketing services. That Google stores and processes e.g. not the name or e-mail address of the users, but processes the relevant data cookie-related within pseudonymous user profiles. That from the perspective of Google, the ads are not managed and displayed to a specifically identified person, but to the cookie owner, regardless of who that cookie owner is. This does not apply if a user has explicitly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The information collected about users through Google Marketing Services is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the United States.</p>

<p>29.5. Among the Google marketing services we use is u.a. the online advertising program "Google AdWords". In the case of Google AdWords, each advertiser receives a different "conversion cookie".

Advertisers will see the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, they do not receive information that personally identifies users.</p>

For these purposes, usage data, e.g. the click on an ad and the IP address of the users processed, whereby the IP address is shortened by the last two places. Therefore, the processing of the users' data is pseudonymised. We use Adsense with non-personalized ads. The ads are not displayed based on user profiles. Non-personalized ads are not based on past user behavior. Targeting uses contextual information, including coarse (eg, on-site) geotargeting based on the current location, content on the current website or app, and current search terms. Google prohibits any personalized targeting, including demographic targeting and user list targeting.</p>

<p>29.8. Also we can use the service "Google Optimizer". Google Optimizer allows us to understand how various changes to a website (such as changes to the input fields, the design, etc.) can take place in so-called "A / B testings". Cookies are stored on users' devices for these purposes. Only pseudonymous data of the users are processed.</p>
