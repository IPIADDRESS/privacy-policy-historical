			<b>OpenAir Privacy Statement</b><br>
			OpenAir, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm
commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and
dissemination practices for this website: www.OpenAir.
			 <br><br>
			We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our
Web site, and for internal tracking and monitoring purposes. Your IP address is used to
gather broad demographic information. We use cookies for application functions, login
purposes and to deliver content on our Web site that is specific to your interests, but
we do not use information from cookies for any marketing purposes, nor do we make that
information available to third parties. Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to
accept cookies will not be able to successfully use the service. In order to login into
your OpenAir account and use OpenAir's applications, you must also enable
JavaScript on your browser. 
			 <br><br>
			Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information, financial
information, and demographic information. We use customer contact information from the
registration form to send the user information about our company. The customer's contact
information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of
receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information
that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for registration and to
bill the user for products and services. Demographic and profile data is also collected
at our site. We use this data for other purposes, but in no case will we make your
individual information available to any third party. 
			 <br><br>
			You may change or update your information at any time by accessing your account at
www.OpenAir. com.
			 <br><br>
			This site contains links to other sites. OpenAir is not responsible for the
privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 
			 <br><br>
			You may be accessing OpenAir site through one of our co-branding partners. If
that is the case, you will also see the brand identity of that partner, and the site
will link back to that partner. However, a user's information entered into OpenAir's
database will not be accessible to that co-branded partner. Our McAfee Partnership
involves a unified registration that allows a McAfee registrant the option of opening an
OpenAir account. If the registrant chooses to open an account, they will access
OpenAir through a co-branded site using the same password they used to register with
McAfee. 
			 <br><br>
			OpenAir has a relationship with Genient Ltd., Jamcracker, Inc., and
SmartContractor, whereby OpenAir hosts customer data entered by customers through an
account created by the customer on the respective partner site. 
			 <br><br>
			<b>Security</b><br>
			This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration
of the information under our control. For example, you may choose to enable SSL
encryption to further protect your information as it is transmitted across the Internet.
Importantly, only specific executive-level employees have access to data files, and
strict internal security features govern this access. All employees are aware of our
security policies, and sign a confidentiality agreement with OpenAir, Inc. 
			 <br><br>
			<b>Choice/Opt-Out</b><br>
			Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from
us at the point where we request information about the visitor. This site gives users
the following options for removing their information from our database so as not to
receive future communications or to no longer receive our service. We communicate with
our members to provide information regarding updates to our service, for customer
support reasons, and to provide our members with other services and offers. These
communications are periodic in nature. Users may opt-out of email communications by
replying to any message they receive from OpenAir or by contacting our support
department directly. They may also indicate which communications they would like to
receive in the "My Options" settings section of their account. 
			 <br><br>
			If any changes occur to this policy in regard to personally-identifiable information
usage, OpenAir will alert all users prior to any action via email. 
		 	<br><br>
			This policy was last updated July 10, 2001 (minor stylistic changes only to December
11, 2000 version).
