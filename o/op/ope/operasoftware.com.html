<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>The Opera browser offers you excellent features for the protection of your privacy and security when using Opera
 in the internet environment. Opera Software has also created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.  This document refers to three distinct areas.  Please note that personally-identifying information that is collected directly by Opera Software is not shared with any other parties. 
</p><ul><li><a href="#opera5">Privacy in the Opera 5 browser</a>

</li></ul>

<h2 id="opera5">Privacy in the Opera 5 browser</h2>
<p>See the following documents for privacy information regarding advertising in the Opera 5 browser:
</p><ul><li>Overview: <a href="adinfo.html">Privacy, Security, and Advertising in Opera 5</a></li>
<li>Technical details: <a href="../opera5/ads.html">Advertising Implementation in Opera 5</a>
</li></ul>

Opera Software has taken much care in the development so that user privacy and security are not compromised. 
No personally-identifying information is collected or shared, and providing ad profile information in the browser is strictly optional. The Opera user's web usage is not tracked. What is recorded and shared with the advertising service provider is the user's interaction with the relative banner advertising.
