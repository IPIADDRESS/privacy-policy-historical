<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><b><font color="#CC0000">The 
  Open Group's Privacy Principles</font><font color="#CC0000"> </font></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At The 
  Open Group, we know how important personal privacy is to you. Because of our 
  interest in protecting your privacy, we have adopted the following privacy principles:</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="3" color="#CC0000">Your 
  Expectation of Privacy</font></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
  recognize that you expect privacy and security for your personal and company 
  affairs. We understand the need to safeguard your sensitive information that 
  you have entrusted to us. We maintain standards and procedures designed to prevent 
  misuse of this information.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font color="#CC0000">Collection, 
  Retention, and Use of Information about You</font></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
  collect, retain, and use information about you only where we reasonably believe 
  that it will help administer our business, communicate with you or provide products, 
  services, and other information to you. We collect and retain information about 
  you only for specific business purposes – and we will tell you why we are collecting 
  and retaining it upon request. We use that information to protect and administer 
  your records, to comply with certain laws and regulations; to help us design 
  or improve our products and services; so that we can provide you with quality 
  products and superior service.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font color="#CC0000">Maintenance 
  of Accurate Information</font></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
  have procedures to help assure that your information is accurate, current, and 
  complete in accordance with commercial standards. We also have procedures to 
  respond to your requests to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner. 
  Whilst some of these procedures are required by law, we have implemented additional 
  procedures to maintain accurate, current, and complete information, including 
  processes to update information and remove old information.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font color="#CC0000">Limiting 
  Employee Access to Information</font></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
  have procedures that limit employee access to personally identifiable information 
  to those employees with a business reason to know such information about you. 
  We educate our employees about the importance of confidentiality privacy through 
  standard operating procedures, special training programs, and our policies on 
  ethics.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font color="#CC0000">Security 
  Procedures to Protect Information</font></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
  maintain security standards and procedures to prevent unauthorized access to 
  confidential information about you. We update and test our technology to improve 
  the protection of our information about you and to ensure the integrity of our 
  information.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font color="#CC0000">Disclosing 
  Information Outside The Open Group</font></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
  do not reveal specific information about your company or personally identifiable 
  data to parties outside our affiliated groups unless it is lawfully permitted 
  or required. We do not provide account or personal information outside The Open 
  Group and its associates for the purpose of independent telemarketing or direct 
  mail marketing of any products or services. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font color="#CC0000">Maintaining 
  Your Privacy in Business Relationships</font></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sometimes 
  it is necessary to provide personally identifiable information about you to 
  a party outside our company, such as to a vendor or service company that we 
  use to provide support or services for one or more of our products. These vendors 
  and service companies agree to safeguard our confidential information about 
  you and your company with us and must abide by applicable.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font color="#CC0000">Our 
  Privacy Commitment to You</font></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
  want you to understand our commitment to personal privacy and our use of information. 
  For this reason, we have prepared these Privacy Principles. These materials 
  will answer most of the important questions that you may have about how we gather, 
  protect, and use information.&nbsp; If you still have questions please email us at
