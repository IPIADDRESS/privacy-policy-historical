Obviously this begs a question, how are these two areas relevant to each other, is this a particularly strong growth area?
Data Integration tools are becoming indispensable in the Enterprise. As companies merge, acquire and grow, their systems need ways to share data. Cost can be a challenge, budgets do not always stretch to the IT change over, or if they do, it’s a planned migration sometimes over years. Sometime technology just does not have an answer, one product, working well for a business with a user adoption because of the familiarity of the application, needs to be retained, and giving rise to the technology challenge of a data migration solution.

Documents can be created using custom filters, from grids and also direct from Contact, Company, Leads and Helpdesk tickets.

The OpenCRM built in HTML editor is still available, and will remain within OpenCRM as it has its own benefits to assist clients with 'cloud document creation'.
