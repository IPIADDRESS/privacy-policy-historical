A customer needs to enter their credit card details on the PayPal payment page only. Kindly note OSV does not store any kind 
of credit card details of our customers.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

You have the option not to provide information; however, withholding information may prevent you from being able to 
use some of our website features.</p>

<p>Information Collected Automatically: Whenever you visit our website, we may automatically collect some information 
about your transactions with us, and your use of our website. For example, we automatically collect your IP address, for 
OSV’s internal use only, such as to help us diagnose problems with our server and administer our website.</p>

by filling out a form with your Personal Information and submitting it to us through our Website, we collect the Personal

e-mail address, telephone number and password. If you place an order with us, we collect the Personal Information that 
you provide to us such as your shipping, billing, and payment information.</p>

<h2>Cookies And Similar Files</h2>

<p>Our Website uses "cookies" and files that are similar to cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers 
created by your browser at our request and stored in an approved and standardized place on your computer.</p>

<p>By transferring these cookies, OSV assigns you a unique customer code and record locater. Information about 
your activity on our Website can then be included in your customer record, which is stored within the OSV firewall. 
When you visit or return to our Website, we read the cookie to identify you as one of our customers and help recall 
orders or preferences you have selected. The cookie also enables us to recall your past activities, post your account data, 
and tailor site elements and special offers to you. No Personal Information about you is stored on the cookie.</p>

<p>Most Web browsers accept cookies by default, but allow users to reject cookies by changing the browser preferences. 
If you have set up your browser to reject cookies, some aspects of our Website, including our Shopping Cart, 
will not work properly.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies and similar files by Opensourcevarsity.com only and does not cover 
the use of cookies and similar files by any third party advertisers or websites linked to the Website.</p>

<p>In future, we may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may use a 
cookie or an action tag, also known as a Web Beacon or a 1 pixel .gif file, to track your response to their advertisement 
and to measure the effectiveness of their advertising or to award incentives or points to their members who respond to 
their advertisements. OSV has no access to or control over cookies or action tags used by these third party companies. 
OSV does not receive any personally identifiable information collected by these advertisers using action tags or cookies 
nor does OSV share any of your personally identifiable information such as your name, telephone number or address with 
these companies except in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

<h2>Use And Disclosure Of Information</h2>

<p>We use the information that we collect about you to maintain, improve, and administer our website, operate our 
business, provide products and services that you request, administer your account, inform you about products and 
services that might be of interest to you, and personalize your online experience.</p>

<p>In order to carry out certain business functions, such as order fulfillment, e-mail delivery, or marketing, we 
sometimes hire other companies to perform services on our behalf. We may disclose personally identifiable information 
that we collect about you to these companies to enable them to perform these services, but they are required to 
safeguard the data and are not authorized to use it for any other purpose than completing their contractual 
requirements to OSV.</p>

<p>For example, as a part of the normal process of completing your purchase, OSV may provide your personal data to 
a third party payment processor, such as PayPal etc depending on your chosen method of payment. Please be aware that, 
because of the limitations of the systems used by some financial institutions, the statement you receive from your 
credit card or financial institution may show the name of a third party payment processor, instead of or in 
addition to the OSV name. </p>

<p>In addition, we may share the information we collect with other companies with whom we have joint marketing arrangements.</p>

<p>We may also disclose information, including personal information; we collect about you in other circumstances 
as required or permitted by law. For example, OSV reserves the right to disclose Personal Information, including 
account information, when we believe such disclosure is appropriate to cooperate with an investigation of 
activities claimed to be unlawful, to enforce our Terms of Use, or to protect the rights or property of OSV or others.</p>

<p>In addition, it is possible that in the future another company may acquire OSV or its assets. It is also possible 
that OSV may partner with or purchase another company to continue to do business as a combined entity. In the event 
that this occurs, it is possible that our customer information, including your Personal Information, may be transferred to the 
new business entity as one of OSV’s assets. In such an event, we will update this policy to reflect any change 
in ownership or control of your Personal Information.</p>

<h2>Links To Third Party Products And Services</h2>

<p>In future conditions, while you are visiting or using the OSV website, you may be presented with an 
opportunity to purchase third party products or services. These products and services are offered and 
supplied by independent companies not owned or operated by OSV.</p>

and any information you provide in response to the offer will be collected and used by the third party 
and not by OSV. Information you provide to the third party and any dealings you have with the third party

<h2>Children´s Privacy</h2>

<p>We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and as such do not target our

providers that collect information from children under the age of 13. We have no control over such content 
providers and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other web sites. It is stated 
for general information that Internet offers open access to a wide range of information; hence it is 
important that parents and guardians supervise and prevent their children’s access to inappropriate content, 
email or chat sessions.</p>

<h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>

<p>Though every effort is made to preserve your privacy, OSV may need to disclose personal information 
when required to by law. If it is deemed necessary that such action needs to be taken, OSV will comply with
