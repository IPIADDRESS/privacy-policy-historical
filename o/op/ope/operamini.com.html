  <h3 class="separator" id="opera">Privacy in the Opera Web browser</h3>

  <p>Opera Software has taken much care in the development process so that user privacy and security are not compromised. No personal information is collected or shared. The Opera user’s Web usage is not tracked.</p>

  <p>Opera Mobile uses Google Analytics on Android to track referred installations to measure effects of marketing campaigns. No personal identifiable information is collected.</p>

  <h4>Opera’s built-in Web search</h4>

  <p>Opera has a built-in Web-search feature. This gives the user the option to utilize external Web search engines directly from the browser interface. Opera relies on third parties for this service. The Opera Web browser sends the user’s search requests (in a specially designed URL string) directly to third-party Web sites that handle the actual search queries. What is sent to the third-party site is only the information needed to perform the particular search query. No personal information is sent.</p>

  <p>Some third-party sites may monitor data traffic from copies of the Opera Web browser, such as numbers of hits and the search terms used. No personally identifiable information is made available to these services by the Opera Mini browser nor by Opera Software.</p>

  <p>Please note: Opera Software does not control the privacy and security practices and policies of these third parties and their sites. Check the particular site and/or business for more information. It is the responsibility of the browser user to use caution before sharing personal information via forms and other methods used by third parties and their Web sites. </p>

  <p><a href="#top" class="top">Top</a></p>

  <h3 class="separator" id="operalink">Privacy in Opera Link</h3>

  <p>Opera Link allows registered users to synchronize some data, such as bookmarks, among their Opera Web browser and Opera Mini Web browsers. Opera will never disclose, share, or distribute an individual’s linked data to any third party except where required by law or regulation, or in cases where you have chosen to grant access to your data to an Opera or third party application or service using Opera Link API. Opera restricts internal access to this information exclusively to those who need it for the operation of the Link service. Information user synchronizes may be stored outside of the country in which the user resides, and user hereby consents to such storage and transfer of information between jurisdictions.</p>

  <p>Opera may retain IP addresses, user ID, and anonymous traffic data as may be useful in the debugging, optimization, and ongoing improvement of this service.</p>

  <p><a href="#top" class="top">Top</a></p>

  <h3 class="separator" id="operaunite">Privacy in Opera Unite</h3>

  <p>Opera Unite allows users to run Web services directly from the Opera desktop browser.  No personally identifiable data is stored by the Opera Unite proxy or other server-side components.  Users may opt to share which services they are running; in such cases, these will be associated only with a user ID and such personal data as may have been volunteered by the user via the My Opera community, Web forums, or similar public venues.</p>

  <p>Opera does not log, track, or store any information served via an Opera Unite service.  Opera may retain IP addresses, user ID, and anonymous traffic data as may be useful in the debugging, optimization, and ongoing improvement of this service.</p>

  <p><a href="#top" class="top">Top</a></p>

  <h3 class="separator" id="operaturbo">Privacy in Opera Turbo</h3>

  <p>When Opera Turbo is enabled, the service will compress network traffic, thereby increasing download speed and reducing data volume. The service requests normal Web content through an Opera Software proxy server. Opera Turbo will exclude Web pages located on an intranet or by using secure connections (HTTPS). Opera collects IP addresses, usage patterns, and the point in time at which the service is used for the purpose debugging, maintenance, optimization of the service, or maintaining the customer relationship. Analysis of service usage is conducted by aggregating data, anonymizing individual identities.</p>
  <p><a href="#top" class="top">Top</a></p>


  <h3 class="separator" id="geolocation">Opera’s geolocation support</h3>
  <p>Opera browsers with support for <a href="/products/geolocation/">geolocation</a> enable users to share their geographic location with websites. If the user chooses to share their location with a web service, they have to enable geolocation support. The location service is provided by Google and is governed by <a href="http://m.google.com/privacy">Google’s privacy policy</a>. The requesting websites’ use of your location is governed by the respective websites’ privacy policies. Opera encourages users only to share their location with websites they trust.</p>

  <p>If you use those services, Google receives information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). Opera does not receive or store any location information. Google returns your location (longitude, latitude and accuracy) and your location is made available to the website by the Opera browser through the W3C Geolocation API.</p>
  <p><a href="#top" class="top">Top</a></p>


  <h3 class="separator" id="operamini">Privacy in the Opera Mini browser</h3>

  <p>Opera Mini is a web browsing service relying on web pages being pre-rendered on Opera Mini servers and then sent to the Opera Mini client on your device. Opera Software is not able to link usage related data in Opera Mini servers to individual persons. Opera Mini servers logs in addition to the web addresses (not content of the web pages), IP-addresses, the end-user device make and model, any campaign reference for the Opera Mini client and a randomly generated identifier for the Opera Mini client. Opera stores and processes usage related log data to provide, debug, maintain and optimize the service including populating “My sites” and “My news” in Home on supported clients. The “Home” can be disabled in <em>Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Home page On/Off</em>. Usage related log data are also used to generate aggregated and anonymized statistics for Opera’s own use and for reporting usage to Opera’s customers such as mobile network operators. </p>

  <p>Opera Mini will receive cookies from visited web sites and when you are using the built-in, search-related features. These cookies can be removed in <em>Menu &gt; Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy</em>.</p>

  <p>Opera reserves the right to disclose any information we have as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.</p>

  <h4>Opera Mini’s built-in Web search</h4>

  <p>Opera Mini has a built-in, Web-search feature. This gives the user the option to utilize external Web search engines directly from the browser interface. Opera Mini relies on third parties for this service. Opera Mini sends the user’s search requests (in a specially designed URL string) directly to third-party Web sites that handle the actual search queries. What is sent to the third-party site is the special Opera Mini search string along with the text terms needed to perform the particular search query. No personal information is sent.</p>

  <p>When using the built-in, search-related features, Opera Mini will receive cookies, including third-party cookies, from third- party sites. These can be removed using <em>Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy</em> from the menu in Opera Mini.</p>

  <p>Some third-party sites may monitor data traffic from copies of the Opera Mini browser, such as numbers of hits and the search terms used. No personally identifiable information is made available to these services by the Opera Mini browser nor by Opera Software.</p>

  <p>Please note: Opera Software does not control the privacy and security practices and policies of these third parties and their sites. Check the particular site and/or business for more information. It is the responsibility of the browser user to use caution before sharing personal information via forms and other methods used by third parties and their Web sites.</p>
