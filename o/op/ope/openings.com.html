            the like), version of the Software &amp; Services, and your configuration and settings of the Software &amp;
            Services;
        </li>
        <li><em><u>Usage Information.</u></em> Certain usage related information regarding your use and interaction with
            your device, including the Software &amp; Services and Other Software, such as when and how you Use the Software
            &amp; Services and Other Software, how you use your internet browser and internet search related applications,

            offerings and advertisements that you view, use and access, how you use them and your response to them, how
            frequently you use them, your search queries and the time and date of your searches;
        </li>
        <li><em><u>Social Networks.</u></em> Your interactions on social networks through the Software &amp; Services;</li>
        <li><em><u>Registration Related Information.</u></em> Information you provide when you register for the Software
            &amp; Services (if applicable), such as name, home or work addresses, email address, telephone and fax numbers,
            birth date and gender; and
        </li>
        <li><em><u>Support Related Information.</u></em> If you communicate with us via our support section or via
            email, we may also collect your email address, name and any information voluntarily submitted by you in
            connection with such support (for example, your name, company name, and particular support query or
            request). Such information will only be used to provide you with support services and will not be connected
            with any other information collected from you on or through the Software &amp; Services, including, any
            individual User ID (as defined below) generated or collected by us.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you Use the Software &amp; Services, we automatically generate an anonymous internal user ID (which does not
        personally identify you), which is assigned to your use of the Software &amp; Services (the <b>"User ID"</b>) and
        may be combined with any of the above information.</p>

    <p>While it is not our intention to collect any personally identifiable information (<b>“PII”</b>) (except for
        registration and user support purposes as set forth in this Privacy Policy), the data collected may include PII.
        As part of our privacy measures, we implement certain rules designed to avoid the unintentional collection of
        PII such as email addresses, social security numbers, credit card numbers, login information, etc. Such rules
        are based on known field types, parameters, values and algorithms but they are not foolproof and hence the
        Software &amp; Services may sometimes, unintentionally, collect unwanted information. We regularly examine and
        update these rules.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>What does Openings.com do with my data?</h4>

    <p>Openings.com only collects data to enhance and personally tailor our website to meet your needs. Personal
        information that is collected allows us to customize website content and generate targeted advertisements based
        on your particular preferences. Cookies help us distinguish between individual users, tailor fit homepages,
        control advertisement frequency, and so on.</p>

    <p>IP addresses help us diagnose server issues and help us administer Openings.com. Without your IP address it would
        be impossible to keep our services running 24/7, and we want to be here for you around the clock. Every email
        sent to Openings.com users is to meet your needs. We offer website updates, inform you of new features, allow
        you to for special offers and sweepstakes, all for your enjoyment. If at any point these emails become annoying

        encountered, or complaints made. We require your email address so we may address these issues.</p>

            appropriate measures to ensure that no user can be individually identified from the disclosure of such

    <br>

    <h4>Cookies and Other Technologies</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>We may collect or allow third parties to collect, through blocks of code called “pixels” or “web beacons”,
        certain information about you and send it to our servers and our partners. We or our partners package all or

            limitation, analyzing which ads your browser has loaded, which site pages you may have been viewing when the
            ads were delivered or accessed, and your interaction with the ad.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies but you can reset your browser to refuse all Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is sent.

    <br>

    <h4>Children under 13</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>The Software &amp; Services are not intended for users under the age of 13 and you hereby represent that you are at least 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect, use, share or disclose any personal information from children under the age of 13. We reserve the right to request proof of age at any stage, so that we can verify that minors under the age of 13 are not using the Software &amp; Services.</p>
    <p>We advise parents and guardians to regularly monitor their children's use of email and other online communications and activities. Control tools that create a safer online environment for children are available from third-party online services and software providers. In the event that it comes to our knowledge that a person under the age of 13 is using the Openings Software, we will prohibit and block such a user from accessing the Software &amp; Services, and will make all efforts to promptly delete any PII with regard to such user, as applicable.</p>
    <p>If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has submitted his or her PII without your consent, please contact us as provided in this Privacy Policy and we will take the necessary steps to remove that information from our database.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>Access</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>You may send us a request to access the PII that we collect through your use of the Software &amp; Services. In such case, we may require that you provide us with additional information to verify your identity.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>Data Retention</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>We retain the information we collect as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as necessary to fulfill our business and/or operational purposes or comply with a legal request. We may also choose to anonymize parts of the information we collect so that it can no longer be identifiable or attributable to any person if we want to keep it for longer periods of time.</p>
    <p><b>Transfer of Data Outside Your Territory</b></p>
    <p>The Software &amp; Services work over the Internet. We may store and process information in various locations throughout the globe. If you are a resident of a European Union Member State or another jurisdiction where transfer of your PII to another jurisdiction requires your consent, then you hereby provide us with your express consent to such transfer of your data.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>Information Security</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>We implement measures to secure your PII that we collect in order to minimize the risks of damage, loss of information, and unauthorized access or use of information. However, these measures are unable to provide absolute information security. Therefore, although we make efforts to secure your PII, we cannot guarantee and you cannot reasonably expect that the Software &amp; Services and its databases are immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unauthorized interceptions, access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>Do Not Track</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Do Not Track is a privacy preference that can be configured in certain web browsers (the <b>"DNT Feature"</b>); the DNT Feature, when enabled on a web browser, signals the websites you visit that you do not want certain information about the websites visited collected. As the Internet industry is in the process of defining how to interpret signals sent by the DNT Feature, Openings does not currently respond or recognize DNT Feature signals.</p>
    <br>
