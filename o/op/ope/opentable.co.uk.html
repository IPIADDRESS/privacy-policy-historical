			<strong>HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</strong></p>
		<p style="margin-left:36pt;">
			<strong>Information Shared With Restaurants</strong></p>
		<p>
			When you make a reservation through our Sites, your information is provided to us and to the restaurants with whom you choose to reserve.&nbsp; In order to facilitate your reservation, your information is provided to that restaurant, just as it would if you made a reservation over the phone, by email to the restaurant or on the restaurant’s website. If you provide a mobile phone number, restaurants may send you text messages regarding your reservation.&nbsp;Some restaurants also require you to provide a credit card number to secure your reservation.&nbsp; We may also share with the restaurants additional information such as information about your dining preferences and history, or information that we collect via Third-Party Platforms.&nbsp; You also have the option of making special preferences or comments about your reservation that OpenTable will pass on to that restaurant.</p>
		<p>
			We may share with restaurants summary reports of feedback from recent diners. If you provide comments about a restaurant, these will be shared with that restaurant. We will not tie your comments with other information that can identify you, but a restaurant may be able to tell who you are from your comments, particularly, if you give your name in the comments or provide contact information such as an email address.</p>
		<p>
			Information you choose to share with a restaurant when you make a reservation may be used by the restaurant for their own purposes. OpenTable does not control the privacy practices of restaurants. Please contact the restaurant directly if you want to learn about their privacy practices.&nbsp;</p>
