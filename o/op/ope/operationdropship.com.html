          <h2 align="center">PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
      <p><i>Last updated January, 2006.</i></p>
      PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES.<br>
      <br>
      The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of
      Operation Drop Ship (the "Company") are discussed in this policy.
      This policy applies to Company's information collection (a) on
      Company's websites, (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to
      Company's other information collection, including the purchase of
      customer lists from third parties.<br>
      <br>
      1. Collection of Information.<br>
      <br>
      1.1 Survey Information. The Company collects information from
      individuals when an individual voluntarily completes a Company survey,
      order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by
      means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages
      operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein,
      "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related
      technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online,
      including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell
      phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, the Company or a
      third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various
      information to the Company, which may include his or her name, email
      address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell
      phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range,
      education and marital status, occupation, employment information,
      personal and online interests, and such other information as may
      requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). Company
      or third party may also collect information such as what browser you
      are using and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. Completing the
      Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no
      obligation to provide Survey Information to the Company or Third Party,
      but an individual may receive incentives from the Company or a Third
      Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to the Company.<br>
      <br>
      1.2 Third Party List Information. The Company collects information from
      individuals when an individual provides information to a third party,
      and the Company subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires
      the information from the third party (the "Seller"). Such purchased
      information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name,
      email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including
      cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range,
      education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment,
      personal and online interests, and such other information as the
      individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List
      Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, the Company
      seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to
      transfer the Third Party List Information to the Company and that the
      Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the
      individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's
      list.<br>
      <br>
      1.3 Other Information. Other occasions when the Company obtains
      information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a
      claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by the
      Company or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance
        through Company's customer service department, and (3) when an
      individual voluntarily subscribes to a Company service or newsletter
      (together, "Other Information").<br>
      <br>
      1.4 Cookies, Web bugs, and Other Information Collected Using
      Technology. The Company currently uses cookie and web beacon technology
      to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual
      with information about the individual in our database. Additionally,
      the Company may use other new and evolving sources of information in
      the future (together, "Technology Information"). <br>
      <br>
      (a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard
      drive of the individual's computer that allows Company to identify the
      individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Company's
      database. You may read more about cookies at www.cookiecentral.com.
      Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use
      all of the features and functionality of the Websites. <br>
      <br>
      (b) Web bugs. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to
      display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see
      www.w3.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an
      individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie)
      to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired
      information about an individual in a database. This allows Company to
      track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web bugs are used
      to determine products or services an individual may be interested in,
       and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For
      example, Company might place, with the consent of a third party
      website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing
      products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in Company's
      database, visits the fishing website, Company receives notice by means
      of the web beacon that Joe visited the fishing site, and Company would
      then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested
      in fishing. Company may thereafter present offers of fishing related
      products and services to Joe. In addition to using web bugs on web
      pages, Company also uses web bugs in email messages sent to individuals
      listed in Company's database. If you wish more information about web
      bugs, you may wish to visit
      http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html<br>
      <br>
      (c) New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including
      cookies and web bugs, is rapidly evolving, as is Company's use of new
      and evolving technology. As a result, Company strongly encourages
      individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of
      technology.<br>
      <br>
      1.5 Outside Information. The Company may receive information about
      individuals from third parties or from other sources of information
      outside of the Company including information located in public
      databases ("Outside Information").<br>
      <br>
      1.6 Individual Information. As used herein, Individual Information
      means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other
      Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any
      other information the Company gathers or receives about individuals.<br>
      <br>
      1.7 No Information Collected from Children. The Company will never
      knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age
      of 13. If the Company obtains actual knowledge that it has collected
      personal information about a child under the age of 13, that
      information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it
      does not collect such information, the Company has no such information
      to use or to disclose to third parties. The Company has designed this
      policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Protection Act
      ("COPA").<br>
      <br>
      1.8 Credit Card Information. The Company may in certain cases collect
      credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration
      date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places
      an order from Company. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to
      Company, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL
      encryption software. The Company will use the Credit Card Information
      for purposes processing and completing the purchase transaction, and
      the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to third parties only as
      necessary to complete the purchase transaction.<br>
      <br>
      2. Use of Individual Information.<br>
      <br>
      2.1 Discretion to Use Information. THE COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL
      INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE
      DISCRETION. The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how the
      Company currently uses Individual Information, but the Company may
      change or broaden its use at any time. As noted below, the Company may
      update this policy from time to time. The Company may use Individual
      Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of
      email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online
      banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses.<br>
      <br>
      2.2 Email. The Company uses Individual Information to provide
      promotional offers by email to individuals. The Company may maintain
      separate email lists for different purposes. If email recipients wish
      to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need to
      follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe
      from the particular list. To unsubscribe from all Company email lists,
      a person must email
      <script type="text/javascript">document.write('abuse@operationdropship.com')</script>abuse@operationdropship.com
      and write in the subject line: "REMOVE FROM ALL LISTS".<br>
      <br>
      2.2(a) Content of Email Messages. In certain commercial email messages
      sent by Company, an advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" line
      but hitting the "Reply" button will cause a reply email to be sent to
      Company. The "Subject:" line of Company email messages will usually
      contain a line provided from the advertiser to Company. The subject
      line will not usually contain phrases such as "ADV:" or
      "ADVERTISEMENT". Company's commercial email messages will contain
      information how an individual may unsubscribe from that particular
      list.<br>
      <br>
      2.2(b) Solicited Email. Company only sends email to individuals who
      have agreed on the Websites to receive email from Company or to
      individuals who have agreed on third party websites to receive email
      from third parties such as Company. Company does not send unsolicited
      email messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for
      unsolicited email are not applicable to Company's email messages.<br>
      <br>
      2.3 Targeted Advertising. The Company uses Individual Information to
      target advertising to an individual. When an individual is using the
      Internet, the Company uses Technology Information (see also Section 2.5
      below) to associate an individual with that person's Individual
      Information, and the Company attempts to show advertising for products
      and services in which the person has expressed an interest in the
      Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology Information, and
      otherwise. The Company may, at its discretion, target advertising by
      using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of
      communication to provide promotional offers.<br>
      <br>
      2.4 Direct Mail and Telemarketing. The Company uses Individual
      Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using
      direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell
      phones. Monitoring and Recording. You hereby give permission and
      consent to Operation Drop Ship or its affiliates to contact you via
      phone or email and agree to allow Operation Drop Ship or its
      affiliates to monitor or record your phone conversations. Verbal notice
      may not be provided of monitoring or recording.<br>
      <br>
      2.5 Use of Technology Information. The Company uses Technology
      Information (1) to match a person's Survey Information and Third Party
      List Information to other categories of Individual Information to make
      and improve profiles of individuals, (2) to track a person's online
      browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine which areas of
      Company's web sites are most frequently visited. This information helps
      the Company to better understand the online habits of individuals so
      that the Company can target advertising and promotions to them.<br>
      <br>
      2.6 Profiles of Individuals. The Company uses Individual Information to
      make a profile of an individual. A profile can be created by combining
      Survey Information and Third Party List Information with other sources
      of Individual Information such as information obtained from public
      databases.<br>
      <br>
      2.7 Storage of Individual Information. The Company stores the
      Individual Information in a database on Company computers. Our
      computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to
      protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information
      under Company's control. Notwithstanding such measures, the Company
      cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent the Company
      computers from being illegally accessed, and the Individual Information
      on them stolen or altered.<br>
      <br>
      2.8 Email Notification of Privacy Policy Changes. Individuals who have
      their information stored in a Company database are eligible to receive
      notification emails from Company when there are material changes in the
      terms of this Privacy Policy. Click here for details or to sign-up to
      receive such notices.<br>
      <br>
      3. Dissemination of Individual Information.<br>
      <br>
      3.1 Sale or Transfer to Third Parties. THE COMPANY MAY SELL OR TRANSFER
      INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S
      SOLE DISCRETION.<br>
      <br>
      3.2 Order Fulfillment. The Company will transfer Individual Information
      to third parties when necessary to provide a product or service that a
      person orders from such third party while using Company web sites or
      when responding to offers provided by Company.<br>
      <br>
      3.3 Legal Process. The Company may disclose Individual Information to
      respond to subpoenas, court orders, and other legal process.<br>
      <br>
      3.4 Summary Data. The Company may sell or transfer non-individualized
      information, such as summary or aggregated anonymous information about
      all persons or sub-groups of persons.<br>
      <br>
      4. Privacy Practices of Third Parties.<br>
      <br>
      4.1 Advertiser cookies and web bugs. Advertising agencies, advertising
      networks, and other companies (together, "Advertisers") who place
      advertisements on the Websites and on the Internet generally may use
      their own cookies, web bugs, and other technology to collect
      information about individuals. The Company does not control
      Advertisers' use of such technology and the Company has no
      responsibility for the use of such technology to gather information
      about individuals.<br>
      <br>
      4.2 Links. The Websites and email messages sometimes contain hypertext
      links to the web sites of third parties. The Company is not responsible
      for the privacy practices or the content of such other web sites.<br>
      <br>
      4.3 Affiliated Companies. The Company may disclose, transfer, and sell
      Individual Information to entities affiliated with Company in Company's
      discretion.<br>
      <br>
      5. Unsubscribe Procedure. If you wish to discontinue receiving email
      messages from Company, you have several options:<br>
      <br>
      (a) Unsubscribe from one email list. To unsubscribe from a particular
      list follow the instructions in each promotional email message sent by
