If you join our panel, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Membership in the panel is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.</a></p><p><a name="area2" id="area2">Opinion Outpost collects demographic and personally identifiable information for a variety of business purposes, which include the building of online survey panels; data generated by individuals who answer survey questions, and through customer care contact. Collected data is used in aggregate by leading survey research consultancies throughout North America and the world to improve consumer products and services worldwide. By way of example, the collected data can be used to measure customer satisfaction, awareness of various advertisements, new concept testing or public opinion on a variety of political issues.</a></p><p><a name="area2" id="area2">Information Collected Passively. Opinion Outpost collects and stores the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using, the browser software you use and your operating system, the date and time you access our site and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site.</a></p><p><a name="area2" id="area2">Opinion Outpost uses this information-which does not identify individual users-to analyze visitor trends, to more effectively administrate the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our visitors as a whole. We are not able nor do we make any effort to match this information to personally identifiable information.</a></p><p><a name="area2" id="area2">Cookies. A cookie is a small text file stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use session ID cookies on our sites. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when the browser is closed. We do not link the information we store in these session ID cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. You do not need to have cookies turned on to participate in our surveys, or to visit our website. However, panel members of www.OpinionOutpost.com must have cookies enabled in order to view information beyond the summary welcome page.</a></p><p><a name="area2" id="area2">Clear Gifs (Web Beacons). Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of a sentence. We do not use clear GIFs on www.OpinionOutpost.com.</a></p><p><a name="area2" id="area2">Opinion Outpost may permit certain third party suppliers to set clear GIFs on the panel referrals obtained through their websites. In addition, we may use clear GIFs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails recipients have opened. These GIFs allow us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications, panel recruitment efforts and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We make no attempts to tie the information gathered by clear GIFs to any personally identifiable information.</a></p><p><a name="area2" id="area2">Information Collected for Panel Registration. Visitors to www.OpinionOutpost.com who wish to join must first complete the registration form. During registration you are required to provide your contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number and e-mail address). We use this information to invite you to participate in relevant survey research in which you have expressed interest. We do not activate panel members' accounts until an e-mail request to the individual is responded to by clicking on a link to confirm and activate their panel membership. Visitors under the age of 18 are not allowed to join our panel. All information provided by individuals under age 18 is deleted.</a></p><p><a name="area2" id="area2">Notices will be sent to your e-mail address inviting you to participate in surveys, and on occasion to contact you with service messages about the www.OpinionOutpost.com panel. We may use your phone number to invite you to participate in surveys comprised of certain area code segments of the population. You may be contacted by phone if you indicated the telephone as one of the modes through which you consent to participate in a survey. Otherwise, we will contact you by telephone only if there is a problem with your panel membership, or to obtain updated information on your membership. We will use your postal address to mail any survey-related incentives such as OpinionPoint reward checks or product samples related to a particular survey. All panel members are required to create a username and password to access information related to their membership on the panel.</a></p><p><a name="area2" id="area2">Opinion Outpost encourages panel members to supply demographic information (e.g., gender, birth date, income level, employment) which we use to pre-qualify panel members for survey opportunities that may be of interest to them. We often ask panel members and survey participants for additional information related to their interests, hobbies and product usage. This information enables us to send surveys corresponding with their area of interest and expertise.</a></p><p><a name="area2" id="area2">Your personally identifiable information will only be used by Opinion Outpost and approved, qualified, third-party companies for purposes of data analysis, reward fulfillment, customer service, survey recruitment or Web hosting.

We will automatically send your friend an e-mail inviting him or her to visit the site. We will only send an e-mail once and will make no further attempts to contact or recruit them using the e-mail address provided. Opinion Outpost stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this invitation e-mail and tracking the success of our referral program.</a></p><p><a name="area2" id="area2">Your friends may contact us at panel@opinionoutpost.com to request we remove this information from our database.</a></p><p><a name="area2" id="area2">Information Collected for Survey Research. Opinion Outpost collects answers to survey questions via the phone and Internet to help organizations research opinions and attitudes about products and services. Besides asking general questions about a product or service, we may ask for additional demographic information such as your gender, age, ethnicity, household income and other pertinent information used to summarize the data collected into market segments. These segments help our clients understand the opinions of products or services among different groups of the overall population. Either Opinion Outpost or one of our clients will aggregate the responses of the survey data we collect. The results of the research are reported in aggregate. Users of the report only see summarized, non-personally identifiable information. We require your consent prior to releasing any personally identifiable information you provide during the survey process. Clients to whom we provide personally identifiable information-disclosed only with the expressed permission of the panel member-are required to sign and abide by CASRO's "Standards Regarding Disclosure of Respondent-Identifiable Data to Clients."</a></p><p><a href="#area0">Table of Contents</a></p><h2>How to Access the information Provided<a name="area3" id="area3"></a></h2><p><a name="area3" id="area3">Participation in our panel is completely voluntary.
