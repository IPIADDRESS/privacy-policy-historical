<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wrapper">
<p>
We recognize that your
privacy is very important and take it seriously. This Privacy Policy describes Opinion
Stage's policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your
information when you use the Opinion Stage Service. We will not use or share
your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This
Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means
(including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized terms that are not
defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our&nbsp;<a href="/tos">Terms of Service</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Information Collection
and Use
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Opinion Stage uses information we collect to
analyze how the Service is used, diagnose service or technical problems,
maintain security, personalize content, remember information to help you
efficiently access your account, monitor aggregate metrics such as total number
of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns, and track User Content and
users as necessary to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and
other applicable laws.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
User-Provided
Information:
</strong>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>You
provide us
information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, if you
register for a member account with the Service. Your name and other information
you choose to add to your profile will be available for public viewing on the
Service. We may use your email address to send you Service-related notices
(including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal
mail). You can control receipt of certain Service-related messages on your
Settings page. We may also use your contact information to send you marketing
messages. If you do not want to receive such messages, you may opt out by
following the instructions in the message. If you correspond with us by email,
we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our
responses.
</p>
<p>
You also provide us
information in User Content you post to the Service. Your questions, answers,
and other contributions on the Service, and metadata about them (such as when
you posted them), are publicly viewable on the Service, along with your name
(unless the Service permits you to post anonymously). This information may be
searched by search engines and be republished elsewhere on the Web in
accordance with our&nbsp;<a href="/tos">Terms of Service</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you choose to use our invitation service to
invite a friend to the Service, we will ask you for that person's email address
and automatically send an email invitation. Opinion Stage stores this
information to send this email, to register your friend if your invitation is
accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies:</strong>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>When
you visit the Service, we may send one or
more "cookies" - small data files - to your computer to uniquely
identify your browser and let Opinion Stage help you log in faster and enhance
your navigation through the site. A cookie may convey anonymous information
about how you browse the Service to us, but does not collect personal
information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your computer after you
close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits
to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web
browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you
close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to
indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may
not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Log Files:</strong>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Log
file information is automatically reported
by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use the Service, our
servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends
whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such
as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type,
referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages,
pages viewed, and other such information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Clear GIFs
Information:
</strong>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>When
you use the
Service, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) which are used to
track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally
identifiable information from your Opinion Stage account is collected using
these clear GIFs. In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails
sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information
is used to enable more accurate reporting and make Opinion Stage better for our
users.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Services:</strong>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Opinion
Stage may use Google Analytics or
Mixpanel to help understand use of the Service. Google Analytics and Mixpanel
collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request,
including cookies and your IP address. Google Analytics and Mixpanel also
receive this information and their use of it is governed by their Privacy
Policies.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
How We Share Your
Information
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Personally
Identifiable Information:
</strong>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Opinion
Stage may
share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the
purpose of providing the Service to you. If we do this, such third parties' use
of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal
information in locations outside the direct control of Opinion Stage (for
instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).
</p>
<p>
As we develop our business, we may buy or sell
assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally
one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may
also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate
divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.
</p>
<p>
We may share or disclose your information with
your consent, such as if you choose to sign on to the Service through a
third-party service. We cannot control third parties' use of your information.
</p>
<p>
Opinion Stage may disclose your personal
information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that it is
reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to
protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical
issues; or to protect Opinion Stage's rights or property.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Non-Personally
Identifiable Information:
</strong>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We
may share
non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data,
referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with
interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain
Opinion Stage services.
</p>
<p>
Opinion Stage may allow third-party ad servers
or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad
servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the
advertisements and links that appear on Opinion Stage. They automatically
receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies
(such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of
their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. Opinion Stage
does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party
ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an
advertiser asks Opinion Stage to show an advertisement to a certain audience
and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude
that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The Opinion
Stage Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities
of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of
such advertisers for more information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
How We Protect Your
Information
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Opinion Stage uses commercially reasonable
physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and
security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant
the security of any information you transmit to Opinion Stage or guarantee that
your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or
destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial
safeguards.
</p>
<p>
In the event that personal information is
compromised as a result of a breach of security, Opinion Stage will promptly
notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in
accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy,
or as otherwise required by applicable law.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Your Choices About
Your Information
</strong>
</p>
<p>
You may, of course, decline to submit
personally identifiable information through the Service, in which case Opinion
Stage may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or
correct your account information and email preferences at any time by logging
in to your account.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Children's Privacy</strong>
</p>
<p>
Protecting the privacy of young children is
especially important. Opinion Stage does not knowingly collect or solicit
personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such
persons to register with the Service. If we become aware that we have collected
personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental
consent, we take steps to remove that information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Links to Other Web
Sites
</strong>
</p>
<p>
We are not responsible for the practices
employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or
content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from
the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your
browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link
on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Changes to Our Privacy
Policy
</strong>
</p>
<p>
If we change our privacy policies and
procedures, we will post those changes on this page to keep you aware of what
information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may
disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted
on this page.
