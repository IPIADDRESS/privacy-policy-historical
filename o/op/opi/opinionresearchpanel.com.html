ConsumerBargainGiveaways, LLC, ("We," "Us," "Our," "opinionresearchpanel"), understands how important privacy is to our members ("you," "your"]. We have created this online Privacy Policy to let you know what information is being collected on our websites, how the information is being used and what choices you have regarding the collection and use of the information. Please take a moment to review this policy and feel free to contact us with any questions at </span><span class="\&quot;MsoHyperlink\&quot;"><span><a href="\"><span>privacy@opinionresearchpanel.com</span></a></span></span><span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<h2><span>WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED?<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
<p><span>Generally, We gather two types of information. The first type of information is the Personally Identifiable Information ("Personal Information") that you expressly provide when you enroll via the online registration forms on our website. This Personal Information includes but is not limited to your name, mailing address, email address, date of birth, gender and telephone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>In addition to the Personal Information you provide to Us, We will also collect certain information online and offline arising out of your use of opinionresearchpanel, including but not limited to the number and type of offers you have responded to and completed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<h2><span>HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED?<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
<p><span>We use your email address to notify you of program updates, special offers and promotions. We use the Personal Information you provide to service your program. For example, We request your mailing address so We know where to send your benefits that you may receive as part of the program, and any other information you may request. We also may use this information to notify you via email, postal mail or phone about new products or services and special promotions as well as to tailor our partners' marketing offers that We display to you throughout opinionresearchpanel and within email communications.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>opinionresearchpanel distributes offers for the purchase of subscriptions and merchandise from our partners, which include national retailers, online merchants, credit card companies and service providers. If you elect to purchase or apply for a subscription or merchandise through opinionresearchpanel from one of our partners, the order form requests information that may include contact information (such as name, address, phone number, and email address) as well as financial information (such as credit card number). Certain offers that appear on our website may require that you provide financial information to Us so that we can, in turn, provide it to our partner who is sponsoring that offer. This partner-requested information will only be provided to the specific sponsor of that offer, and only if you submit that offer. opinionresearchpanel will not use this information.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>opinionresearchpanel may choose to provide aggregate non-personally identifiable demographic information about you to non-affiliated third-parties for statistical purposes only.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><span>MARKETING PARTNERS<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p><span>From time to time, We may share your name, address, phone or email address with nonaffiliated partners and/or affiliated third parties who offer products or services that We feel may be of interest to you. Affiliated companies are those companies that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with another company. ConsumerBargainGiveaways, LLC may also send you emails on behalf of our partners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Some offers or services will require Us, by their terms, to forward your personal information (such as mailing address for delivery of orders) to a partner so that they can provide the service directly to you. If you become a Member through a partner web site, your basic enrollment, activity and interest information may be shared with that partner, as applicable, and that partner may share information it collects about you with Us, subject to its own information practices and privacy policies. We share this information so that we can credit your account for the points earned with that offer. We will provide you with notice of such instances at the point where the information is collected. The choice to participate is yours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<h2><span>SERVICE PROVIDERS<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
