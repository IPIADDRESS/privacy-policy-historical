<p>
        OpinionResearchPanel honors the privacy of its clients, members and visitors ("You", "Your") and created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. We comply with all applicable federal and state laws concerning data privacy, as well as best practices and procedures and guidelines established by industry groups.

This statement is intended to apply to all clients, members and visitors of this web site.</p>
<p>
        By using and accessing the Site, you acknowledge you have read, understood and agree to be bound to all the terms and practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, exit this page and do not use or access the Site.</p>
<p>
        <strong>WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED?</strong></p>
<p>
        Generally, two (2) types of information are gathered. The first type of information is the Personally Identifiable Information ("Personal Information") provided when You enroll in one of Our Programs via the online registration forms on one of Our properties. This Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, Your name, mailing address, email address, date of birth, gender and telephone number.</p>
<p>
        In addition to the Personal Information You provide to Us, We will also collect certain information online and offline arising out of Your participation in the Program and use of the property including, but not limited to, the number and type of offers You have responded to and completed.</p>
<p>
        Any member who discloses Personal Information on Our property is entitled to either: (1) a list detailing the categories of Personal Information shared and the third parties to which such information was provided by such property; or (2) a mechanism by which You may opt-out of having Your Personal Information shared with third-parties. We have elected the second option. You may opt out from having Your Personal Information shared with third-parties by sending Your request, including Your full name, email address and postal address to: OpinionResearchPanel, 1150 Wilmette Ave, WILMETTE, IL 60091. Please be advised that where You opt-out from permitting Your Personal Information to be shared with third-parties, You may still receive selected offers directly from Us, in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>
        <strong>HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED?</strong></p>
<p>
        We use Your email address to notify You of Program updates, special offers and promotions. We use Your Personal Information in connection with Your participation in the Program.

<p>
        <strong>WHAT ARE COOKIES AND HOW DO WE USE THEM?</strong></p>
<p>
        We use a feature of Your Internet browser called a "cookie" to assign a unique identification to Your computer. Cookies are files Your web browser places on Your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be used to help save and retrieve passwords used on the property and to save information on past activities and other preferences. Where cookies are used, You do not have to re-enter log-in information every time You visit the property. When You visit the property, Our servers read the cookie to help target and personalize offers to You. For example, the cookie can help ensure You do not see an offer You have already completed. Cookies also let Us know if We have repeat visitors. We also use cookies to identify which properties Our repeat visitors are coming from. We do not and cannot use cookies to retrieve Personal Information about You from Your computer unless such information was knowingly and willingly provided by You. We respect Your privacy and Our cookies are not linked to any Personal Information. We work with third-parties to serve ads on the property. These ads may contain cookies and/or action tags (also known as single pixel gifs) to measure advertising effectiveness and gather completely anonymous information. We have no access to or control over these cookies or action tags.</p>
<p>
        You are always free to decline these cookies if Your browser permits, however You may not be able to use certain features on the property and You may be asked to re-enter Your user ID and password more frequently during Your sessions on the property.</p>
<p>
        <strong>HOW DO WE PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p>
        We have security measures in place designed to protect the security of Your information. All collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure environment. In addition when You submit Your credit card information or other sensitive information, the 128-bit encrypted Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") connection scrambles or encrypts Your information before it is sent to Us over the Internet. This protects Your credit card information from being read while it is transferred. SSL is supported by Netscape 2.0+, Microsoft IE 3.0+ and most frame-enabled browsers. Depending on which browser You use, You will know You are in a secure area by "https" or a small key or padlock in the bottom right hand corner of Your browser indicating Your transaction is secure. Unfortunately, no security measures can ever be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while We strive to protect Your Personal Information and sensitive information, We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information You transmit to Us, and You do so at Your own risk. Once We receive Your transmission, We make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on Our systems. Access to Personal Information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. All Personal Information is restricted in Our offices. Only employees that need the Personal Information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to Personal Information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all Personal Information. Employees not adhering to Our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, We shall notify You and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event We learn of an information security breach with respect to Your Personal Information. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.</p>
<p>
        <strong>DO THESE SAME PRIVACY POLICIES APPLY TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES THAT YOU ACCESS THROUGH OUR PROPERTY?</strong></p>
<p>
        No. The Privacy Policy appearing on the property relates only to Us. You will notice the property may contain links to other websites, such as websites operated by Our Advertisers. We cannot be responsible for, and shall have no liability in connection with, the privacy and security practices of other websites You may access through the property, even if links to those third party websites are displayed within a frame on Our property.
