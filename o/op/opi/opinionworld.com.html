Aggregate summary includes providing Demographic Information about a group of persons without specifically identifying any person within the group. </p>

The intent is to help advertisers understand what their ads communicate to internet users. Online ad exposure programs include: (i) a locally stored object (“<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LSO</span></strong>”), which can identify tags contained in on-line advertisements, being dropped onto a person’s Web browser; (ii) when the person views a Web page containing an online ad that has been tagged, the tag reads the LSO and provides SSI’s client with a unique identification number that does not personally identify the person; and (iii) SSI’s client supplies SSI with the identification number and requests that SSI provide the person associated with, or connected to, the identification number, a Survey related to the advertisement. </p>

Opting-out of SSI’s online ad exposure program will only apply to SSI’s program and will not affect or restrict third parties from deploying LSOs or similar technology onto your Web browser or remove you from participation in online ad exposure or tracking programs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

In general, digital fingerprinting technologies assign a unique identifier to a user’s computer to identify and track the computer. SSI uses digital fingerprinting technology (the “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technology</span></strong>”) to assist SSI’s clients in ensuring the integrity of Survey results by identifying duplicate and fraudulent respondents and to provide you with certain security protection. SSI may engage a third party or third parties to assist SSI in the implementation and use of the Technology. The Technology analyzes publicly available information and data obtained from a computer’s web browser and from other publicly available data points, including, without limitation, the technical settings of the computer, the characteristics of the computer, and the computer’s IP Address, to create a unique identifier assigned to the computer. The unique identifier does not contain any information or data that individually identifies the person who is assigned the unique identifier. In furtherance of SSI’s efforts to assist its clients in protecting and ensuring the integrity of Survey results, SSI: (i) may link or associate your unique identifier to you and any of your Personal Information; (ii) may share your unique identifier with SSI’s clients and with other sample or panel providers; and (iii) may receive or obtain a unique identifier linked to you from a third party, including, without limitation, a sample or panel provider or a client of SSI. Any unique identifier(s) received or obtained by SSI and linked to an identified or identifiable individual shall be protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The Technology may utilize an internet cookie or similar technology in connection with collecting and analyzing the information and data. </p>
<p style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%; background-repeat: repeat repeat; text-align: justify;">SSI uses reasonable efforts to ensure that the Technology is safe, secure, and does not cause undue privacy or data security risks. SSI uses and distributes the Technology in a professional and ethical manner and in accordance with: (i) this Privacy Policy and (ii) Applicable Laws and Codes. </p>
<p style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 0%; background-repeat: repeat repeat; text-align: justify;">If SSI discovers or learns of any illegal or unethical conduct in connection with the use of the Technology, or that the Technology is being used in a manner inconsistent with the statements and/or disclosures made by SSI, SSI shall use reasonable efforts to restrict, limit, or prohibit the illegal or unethical conduct and to ensure the proper use and administration of the Technology. </p>

From time-to-time, SSI may engage a third party or third parties to validate Panel and non-Panel members. The purpose of the data validation is to assist SSI’s clients in ensuring the integrity of Survey results. For Panel members, validation may occur during and/or after registration with a Panel, including, without limitation, prior to, during, or after participation in a Survey. For non-Panel members, validation may occur prior to, during, or after participation in a Survey. The data validation process involves: (i) SSI disclosing or transferring Personal Information to a Subcontractor, (ii) the Subcontractor performing validation services, and (iii) the Subcontractor returning the Personal Information to SSI with any updates or corrections and, if applicable, with a validation score. SSI reserves the right to reject, deny, or terminate Panel membership, or to deny or reject Survey participation, if Personal Information is not validated to SSI’s satisfaction.</p>
