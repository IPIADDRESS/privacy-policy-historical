The data collected is used as part of anonymous market research reports that help shape the future of the Internet. The information that you contribute is used by comScore, Inc., a U.S.-based market research company that is a nationally-recognized authority on Internet and general economic trends, whose data are routinely cited by major media outlets such as the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and CNBC, and is extensively used by the largest Internet services companies and scores of Fortune 500 companies.<br><br>
              Be assured that protection of your privacy is one of our top priorities.  While participation in our program will allow us to send you periodic surveys and track information about your online activities such as where you surf and the transactions that you make, <u>the personally identifiable information you provide to us will NOT be used by us, or anyone with whom we do business, to advertise or market products or services to you!</u><br><br></div><div class="C_H1">PRIVACY POLICY &amp; USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</div><br><div class="C_TDS">Before joining our program, enjoying the benefits of this program, and installing our application, you must review and agree to the terms and conditions below and provide and obtain consent to this agreement from anyone who will be using the computers on which you install this application. By installing our application, you agree to be bound by this privacy policy &amp; user license agreement, including the storage of the market research information provided by you on our computer systems in the United States.<br><br></div><div class="C_TDS"><u>Requirements for participation:</u> In order to participate in this program, you must:
            <br><ul style="margin-top:4px;margin-bottom:4px;" class="C_TDS"><li>Be at least 18 years of age and capable of entering into a binding agreement;</li><li>Be the parent or legal guardian of anyone under 18 having access to such computer;</li><li>Own or control the computers that you allow to be configured to use this system;</li><li>Not be employed or related to an individual employed by an unaffiliated market research company; and</li><li>Acknowledge and agree to allow the software to operate as described herein, including allowing the software to automatically upgrade provided that any such upgrades do not change the functionality of the software beyond what is described in this privacy policy and user license agreement.</li></ul>Please note: many companies restrict the installation of software onto work computers. Before you install this software onto a work computer, please check your company’s software installation policy.<br><br></div><div class="C_H1">What information is collected?</div><br><div class="C_TDS"><u>Basic Demographic Information:</u> When you sign up for this program, we may obtain your contact information and some basic demographic information about you using a questionnaire, information from companies through which you obtained or inquired about this program, or the application that you install onto your computer and allow to track your Internet usage.
            <br><br><u>Survey response information:</u> Once you agree to participate in this program, we may notify you of survey opportunities through e-mail, pop-ups, toast windows, U.S. mail, and other means. If you elect to participate in a survey, we require that you provide complete and accurate information about yourself and your household.
            <br><br><u>Computer hardware, software, and other configuration information:</u> Our application may collect general hardware, software, computer configuration and application usage information about the computer on which you install our application, including such data as the speed of the computer processor, its memory capacities and Internet connection speed.  In addition, our application may report on devices connected to your computer, such as the type of printer or router you may be using.
            <br><br><u>Internet usage information:</u> Once you install our application, it monitors all of the Internet behavior that occurs on the computer on which you install the application, including both your normal web browsing and the activity that you undertake during secure sessions, such as filling a shopping basket, completing an application form or checking your online accounts. We may use the information that we monitor, such as name and address, for the purpose of better understanding your household demographics; however we make commercially viable efforts to automatically filter confidential personally identifiable information such as UserID, password, credit card numbers, and account numbers. Inadvertently, we may collect such information about our panelists; and when this happens, we make commercially viable efforts to purge our database of such information.
            <br><br>Our application will review the content of all web pages to determine the language being used in the web site, and the application may review select e-mail header information from web-based e-mails as a way to verify your contact information and your online usage information.<br><br></div><div class="C_H1">How is the information collected?</div><br><div class="C_TDS">This application monitors your Internet usage by transmitting to our servers information about the web pages that you visit and the actions that you take while online.<br><br>Consequently, the software may communicate with our servers while you are connected to but not browsing the Internet.  Such communications could include the transmission of collected data as outlined in this privacy policy, or it could include incoming instructions for our software.  For example, our servers need to tell our software about survey opportunities, so that we can provide you with invitations where you can take a survey in exchange for sweepstake entries, cash, or other prizes. <br><br>In addition, we may ask for information about you using surveys, for which participation is completely voluntary. We may also combine the information that you provide us with information obtained from other sources (such as consumer preference reporting companies, credit reporting agencies and companies that collect TV viewing information) using confidential matching procedures. In these cases, we will: (i) provide a data match processor with only the personal information necessary to perform a match and, infrequently, to assist us performing statistical analyses; (ii) establish procedures and legal obligations that prohibit use of the information received for any other purpose or disclosure of this information to anyone else; and (iii) require destruction of the received information after completion of the match and analysis. The information that we obtain from other sources will not include confidential personally identifiable information such as credit card numbers and account numbers.<br><br>The software will collect information on the types of applications you use and general statistics on how you use them.  So, for instance, you may open a word processor, and our software would collect information on how the type of word processing software that you are using, and how long the word processor was open, but it would not have any knowledge of what was typed in the word processor.<br><br>Your information is stored in the United States where our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of other countries may differ from those of the United States. Your information may be processed outside of the United States, provided that the data protection laws of such processing location affords similar if not more protections than those afforded in the United States for the processed data.<br><br></div><div class="C_H1">How is the collected information used?</div><br><div class="C_TDS"><u>Market Research Reports:</u> Applying concepts similar to those used by television-rating services, we use the information collected through our application and your survey responses, combined with information from other sources, to make statistically-based projections about current and future Internet user behavior and, more generally, to extrapolate data about potential economic trends.  For certain commercial customers, we may provide individual-level information. We make this data available so that these customers may enhance their own understanding of Internet usage and online commercial trends.  In all cases, we make commercially viable efforts to automatically filter confidential personally identifiable information such as UserID, password, credit card numbers, and account numbers from the data being provided.
            <br><br>Our customers use our market research reports to: (i) modify online services and offerings; (ii) make more effective use of online data to understand both online and offline commercial behavior; and (iii) discern general economic trends and the business performance of specific entities for a wide range of business purposes including, but not limited to, identifying financial investment opportunities and understanding the value and interest in certain business enterprises.<br><br><u>By Service Providers:</u> From time to time, we may share your contact information with those third parties who help us deliver this program to you (for example, companies that administer incentive programs). When we do this, we provide only the necessary information for the service provider to perform its assigned function, and we contractually prohibit the use or disclosure of this information to anyone else unless you authorize it.
            <br><br><u>As Required by Law:</u> In rare cases, and as is done by any other business, if we are compelled to disclose certain information through a valid legal process, such as a court order, subpoena, or a search warrant, we would do so. However, we would comply by providing only the minimum information necessary.
            <br><br></div><div class="C_H1">How is the information secured?</div><br><div class="C_TDS"><u>Safeguards:</u> We have implemented a variety of safeguards (including physical, digital, and legal protections) focused on ensuring that the information collected through this program is protected from unauthorized use, modification, or disclosure. For example, any secure information collected by our application is encrypted before it is sent to our servers. Moreover, our employees are subjected to periodic evaluation and investigation, are contractually restricted on their use and access to personally identifiable information, and are educated and retrained as needed on internal security policies and procedures.
            <br><br>If you would like to access, modify, and/or request deletion of the personally identifiable profile information submitted by you as part of this program, you may complete a support form on our website, or e-mail our support staff at the e-mail address provided below.<br><br></div><div class="C_H1">Does the application use cookies?</div><br><div class="C_TDS">We do not use our cookies to store or acquire data about you; however, we do use cookies to identify you as you go through any required registration processes on our site, and to assist us in conducting occasional diagnostic tests to ensure that our system is functioning correctly.

After you remove our application from a computer, all settings we have made to your computer will be deactivated; however, some inactive elements may remain on your machine such as registry entries or DLL files, which is not at all unusual for many types of online services and software.

We reserve the right to repair any of its settings that are partially removed, to minimize potential instability. In fact, our software will inspect itself and make repairs when necessary.
