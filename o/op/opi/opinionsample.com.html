            <p></p>
            <p>
                We use your personal information only within the company and forward it only to those companies that are involved in performing the contracts concluded with you or otherwise involved in providing the relevant service. Otherwise, your personal information will not be forwarded to third parties unless you have given your express consent for this or unless we are obliged to disclose it, for example, at the direction of a court or administrative authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may share your personal information and/or social-demographic information, including, without limitation, a unique identification number ("UID"), postal code, gender, marital status, education, ethnicity/race (where permitted by applicable law), employment related information, and non-personally identifiable information on household members, with third party sample/market research companies (individually each a "Third Party MR Company" and collectively the "Third Party MR Companies") for various purposes, including, without limitation, identifying third party survey opportunities for you, disclosing such data elements to clients of the Third Party MR Companies for audience measurement services, appending such data elements to completed client surveys and delivering the appended survey data to clients of the Third Party MR Company(ies) for analytical or research purposes, facilitating your participation in a third party survey(s), tracking your survey activity, addressing survey quality issues, and incentive/reward fulfillment.
            </p>
            <p>
                As some of these third parties may reside outside of the European Union/European Economic Area, your personal data and non-personal data may be transferred, processed, and stored outside of the country in which you reside.
            </p>
            <p>

                information as set forth in this Section. Your participation in such survey opportunities does not
                entitle you to any benefits offered by, or membership with, the Third Party MR Companies.

            </p>
            <p>
              In order to protect your personal data against unauthorised access by third parties when being transmitted, we secure data transmissions, if necessary, using SSL encryption. This is a standard encryption procedure for online services, particularly for the Internet.

            <h3>Web analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Like almost all website operators, we use analytical tools in the form of tracking software to ascertain the number of users using our website and how frequently they visit.
            </p>
            <p>
                To enable us to optimise our website and our service, we use Google Analytics, which is a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses what are known as "cookies": these are text files stored on your computer and used to analyse your website usage. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website (including your IP address) will be sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, if IP anonymisation is enabled on this website, within member states of the European Union, or in other states that are party to the agreement on the European Economic Area Google first abbreviates your IP address. The full IP address will only be transmitted in exceptional circumstances to one of Google's servers in the USA, where it will then be abbreviated. Google will use this information on behalf of our website operator to analyse your use of the website in order to compile reports about website activities for the website operator and to perform other services connected with the use of the website and of the Internet. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged or combined with other data by Google. You can prevent cookies from being stored by applying the appropriate settings in your browser software; please note, however, that in this case you may not be able to use all of the functions of this website to their full extent.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may also prevent Google from collecting data generated by the cookie referring to your website usage (including your IP address), and from processing these data by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available from the following link tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de . As an alternative to the browser add-on or within browsers on mobile devices, please click on this link to prevent Google Analytics from collecting data in this website in future (the opt-out only works in this browser, and only for this domain).

            <h2>Google Fonts</h2>
            <p>
                This site uses web fonts provided by Google to uniformly display fonts. When you open a page, your browser loads the required Google Fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                To do this, your browser must connect to Google's servers. This gives Google knowledge that our website has been accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Fonts is in the interest of a consistent and user-friendly presentation of our website. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your browser does not support Google Fonts, your computer uses a standard font.

            <h2>Social Networks</h2>
            <h3>Facebook</h3>
            <p>
                Facebook is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA and is available online at www.facebook.de . Individual social media plugins feature one of the Facebook logos or the extension 'Facebook Social Plugin'. A list of the visuals and functions of the individual plugins can be seen here: developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins. Whenever you visit a page on our website which contains one of these social media plugins, your browser will establish a direct connection with the Facebook servers. The content of the social media plugins are transferred from Facebook to your browser, which incorporates them into the website. We therefore have no influence over the scope of the data which Facebook collects using its social media plugins, and are able to provide information to you about this only to the best of our knowledge: Because the social media plugin is embedded, Facebook is informed that you have visited the page of our website in question, even if you are not a registered user of Facebook or are not logged into Facebook at the time. This information is transferred from your browser along with your IP address to a Facebook server in the USA and stored there. According to information provided by Facebook, only an anonymised IP address is stored for non-registered users in Germany. If you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can directly attribute it to your Facebook account whenever you visit our website. Facebook receives information about your visit to our website, regardless of whether you interact with the social media plugins. If you interact with the social media plugins (for example, click the 'Like' button or leave a comment), the relevant information is transferred by your browser directly to Facebook and stored there. Additionally, the information is published on Facebook and displayed to your Facebook friends. To find out about the purpose and scope of this data gathering, further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as your rights and options for protecting your privacy, please review the Facebook privacy policy www.facebook.com/about/privacy . If you are a registered Facebook user, and prefer Facebook not to collect data about you via our website and connect it with your membership data stored at Facebook, you must log out of Facebook before visiting our website. It is also possible to block the social media plugins using add-ons for your browser, such as the Facebook Blocker: webgraph.com/resources/facebookblocker
            </p>
            <h3>Youtube</h3>
            <p>
                This website uses plugins from Youtube.de/Youtube.com which is operated by Youtube, LLC (901 Cherry Avenue, San Bruno, CA 94066, USA). If you visit a website that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection with the YouTube servers. These plugins transfer data to the YouTube servers about which websites you have visited. If you are logged in as a member of YouTube, YouTube attributes this information to each of your personal user accounts on these platforms. When using these plugins (for example, clicking the 'Play' button on a video or leaving a comment), this information is attributed to your YouTube user account, which you can prevent by logging out of your account before using the plugin. For more information, please review the privacy policy: <a href="www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy" target="_blank">www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy</a>

            <p>
                This website uses buttons for the Twitter service which is offered by Twitter Inc. (1355 Market St., Suite 900, San Francisco, CA, 94103, USA). These plugins can be identified by terms such as 'Twitter', 'tweet' and/or the Twitter logo. They make it possible, among other things, to share a comment or a page of this website via Twitter. When you visit a website which contains such a button, your browser establishes a direct connection with the Twitter servers. The content of the Twitter button is transferred directly from Twitter to your browser. We therefore have no influence over the scope of the data collected by Twitter via this plugin, and can only provide information on this to you to the best of our knowledge. Log data (for example, the user's IP address and previously visited websites, etc.) are transferred to Twitter. For more information, please review the Twitter privacy policy: twitter.com/privacy

                The "XING Share Button" is installed on this website. When accessing this site, your browser
                will briefly connect to the servers of XING AG, Dammtorstraße 29-32, 20354 Hamburg
                ("XING"), which establishes the "XING Share Button" functions (in particular the
                calculation/display of the counter value). XING does not store any of your personal data regarding

            <p>
                Plug-ins from LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (LinkedIn) are incorporated in this website. The LinkedIn plug-ins are identifiable from the LinkedIn logo or the "Share Button" on this website. If you visit this website, a direct connection will be generated between your browser and the LinkedIn server through the plug-in. In this way, LinkedIn receives information on the fact that you visited this website with your IP address. If you click on the LinkedIn "Share Button" while you are logged in to your LinkedIn account, you can link the contents of this web page to your LinkedIn profile. In this way, LinkedIn can allocate the visit to this website to your user account. Please note that we as website operators receive no knowledge of the content of the data transferred or their use by LinkedIn. You can find details on data collection (its purpose, extent, further processing and use) as well as on your rights and the possibility to amend settings in LinkedIn's privacy policy.

                this website. These 'AddThis' plugins enable you to place bookmarks and/or share interesting website
                content. When you visit this website, the plugin creates a direct connection between your browser and
