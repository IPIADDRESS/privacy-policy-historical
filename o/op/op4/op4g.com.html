      <h3 class="subhead_orange">Gathering and Handling <br>of Personal Information</h3>
      <p>Op4G is committed to maintaining the highest possible level of protection for Member-provided information.
        Op4G does not distinguish between personal and non-personal information.
        All information provided is considered personal and its protection is an utmost focus of the organization.
        Specifically, all Member-information will be stored in a database physically separated from Op4G’s interactive website.
        Member provided input will include demographic information necessary to establish response groups or pools tailored to the requirements set forth by Client requests.
        Unless specifically approved by a Member, through a pro-active, opt-in election, any information conveyed to Clients is on an anonymous basis.
        Externally, Members are identified strictly by their chosen username and there is no means by which a Member’s true identity can be determined.</p>

      <h3 class="subhead_orange">Member, Client and Non-Profit Interaction</h3>
      <p>Member activity on the Op4G website is strictly on an opt- in basis.
        While internal messaging will occur, it will be only as a means to inform Members of relevant pending information on the Op4G message board.
        Through notices on the message board, Members will be invited to participate in specific activities (i.e. surveys, focus groups, product evaluations, etc.) based on profiles requested by our Clients.
        Members will be identified through their username with Op4G certifying the Member’s authenticity to the Client.
        Member responses will be compiled, consolidated and delivered to the Client in a pre-agreed upon format.
        All respondent profile information will be non-traceable to any Member’s actual identity.
        In the event a Member agrees to participate in an open online forum or any other medium requiring Internet contact with a Client, all such Clients will be required to agree in writing that no Member contact information will be recorded or kept on file for any reason.
        Also, all such Clients will have agreed not to contact any Member for any function outside the scope of the activity to which the Member has agreed to.</p>

      <p>Member designated Charities will be provided information identifying donor Members.
        As all Member earnings are 100% taxable, Charities are required to provide donors with annual donation statements.
        The information provided to the Charities will be limited to the names and addresses of donor Members.</p>

      <h3 class="subhead_orange">Third Party Interfacing</h3>
      <p>While Op4G provides links to third party websites, Members utilizing them will connect autonomously with no associated transfer of information from Op4G.
        Any subsequent Member activity with a third party is not subject to Op4G’s Terms and Conditions (including this Privacy Policy).
        Members are wholly responsible for their interaction with any third party associations.
        Members should be aware of that particular third party’s privacy policy prior to disclosure of any personal information.</p>

      <h3 class="subhead_orange">Membership Status</h3>
      <p>Members will have the ability to update their personal information at anytime via their personal page at myOp4G.com.
        Additionally, Members can likewise terminate their relationship with Op4G at any time for any reason via the “Gone 4 Good” link at myOp4G.com.
        In the event of termination, all Member information will be permanently deleted from all company data bases except in the event the retaining of personal information is required by law (i.e. for tax purposes, notices, etc)
        or for Op4G’s obligations to Members (i.e. retaining information relative to tax deductible donations, etc).</p>

      <h3 class="subhead_orange">Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>Op4G reserves the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy.
        All changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on the Op4G website 7 days prior to enactment.
        Notice of any such posting will be given to the full Membership.
        The continued use of the Op4G website after notice and institution of any changes to this policy, will constitute acceptance of those changes by the Member.</p>

      <h3 class="subhead_orange">Information Sharing</h3>
      <p>Applicable laws may require the disclosure of personal information in the event of certain legal processes, including but not limited to court orders, criminal investigations and certain civil proceedings.</p>

      <p>In the event a Member’s annual income through participation on theOp4G website is equal to or greater than six hundred dollars ($600.00), government requirements necessitate the distribution of a 1099 Earned Income Statement from Op4G to the Member.
        Consequently, in this instance, a Member’s Social Security number must be provided to Op4G, solely for the use of this purpose.
        However, Members shall have the option to withhold disclosure of their Social Security number.
        In that event, all earnings exceeding $600 shall be forwarded directly to that Member’s chosen Non-Profit.
        This will be the only instance in which a Member’s Social Security number will be requested.
        While Op4G must report the issuance of the 1099 Statements to the responsible government  authority, it is the individual Member’s responsibility to account for any applicable tax liabilities.</p>

      <p>No entities outside of Op4G shall ever have access to both personal and demographic Member information.
        For the purpose of check processing for Member compensation, only the name and address of the Member shall be provided to a third party processing entity (a nationally recognized, SAS 70 compliant bank), and this information is to used for the sole purpose of Member payment.
        If a Member chooses to be compensated through PayPal, they must provide account information to Op4G which in turn shall be used by the payment processing entity.</p>

      <h3 class="subhead_orange">Cookies</h3>
      <p>A cookie is a short text file which is sent to your browser from a web server.
        Op4G employs the use of cookies solely for improving the efficiency and enhancement of Member interaction with the Op4G website.
        Op4G employs both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Specifically, the use of session cookies enhances the Member’s ability to navigate the website.
        Persistent cookies are used to enhance the experience of the Op4G website by tracking and targeting the interests of our Members.
        Additionally, a persistent cookie is used to store your account ID to eliminate the need for entering profile information more than once.
        While a session cookie expires when you close your browser, a persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
        Member’s can remove persistent  cookies at any time by following directions provided in their Internet browser’s “Help” file.</p>

      <h3 class="subhead_orange">Transfer of Ownership</h3>
      <p>In the event of any pending transfer of ownership or controlling interest of Op4G, the full Membership will be informed prior to such a change
        Members will have an opportunity to evaluate the Terms and Conditions, including the privacy policy, under which any new ownership anticipates operating.</p>

      <h3 class="subhead_orange">Client Provided Information</h3>
      <p>Client information provided in any form in support of Member activities (i.e. surveys, focus groups, product evaluations, etc.) is considered the proprietary property of that Client unless notice to the contrary has been conveyed.
        Consequently, all such information is protected through applicable intellectual property laws and is not to be used for any purpose beyond the scope of the activity for which it was intended.</p>

      <h3 class="subhead_orange">Minors</h3>
      <p>Membership on the Op4G website is restricted to individuals who are eighteen (18) years of age or older.
        No information from individuals under the age of 18 will be knowingly solicited or recorded.
        In the event such an instance occurs, all information related to that specific transaction will be immediately deleted and all correspondence terminated.</p>
