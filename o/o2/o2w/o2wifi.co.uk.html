        <h2>How to connect to O2 Wifi</h2>
        <p>These terms, our Fair Usage Policy and our Privacy Policy together make up the terms and conditions (the "Terms") for Telefónica UK Limited's O2 Wifi wireless communication service (the "Service"). Please read them carefully, so that you fully understand the Service that you are signing up to and plan to use. The Terms explain what you can use the Service for and the ways in which we will provide the Service and how we will use data that we collect as part of your use of the Service.</p>
        <p>If anything's unclear, contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@o2wifi.co.uk" title="Email admin@o2wifi.co.uk">admin@o2wifi.co.uk</a> or before accepting the Terms or using the Service.</p>
        <p>If you're already an O2 customer then these Terms are in addition to the terms of the other services that you already take from O2.</p>
        <h2>Using the Service</h2>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>O2 Wifi is a free service. Because of this, we retain the right to change the Terms at any time. If we are going to make changes to the Terms or the Service to your significant disadvantage, we will try to give you notice of the changes before they take place. For changes that we need to make in a hurry (for instance, to meet legal and regulatory requirements) we may not be able to give you advance notice. In this case we will try to notify you as soon as we can. We may charge for certain elements of the service in the future. If we do intend to charge for any part of the Service, we'll let you know well in advance.</li>
          <li>Any changes we do make will be posted on our website. We may also give you notice in writing, by text to your nominated mobile phone number, and/or by email where you have supplied your email address to us for this purpose (you can see when the Terms were last changed by checking the "Last Updated" date at the bottom). Your continued use of the Service following the updating of the Terms indicates you accept those changes. As there is no minimum subscription period for the Service, if you do not like any changes that we make then you will be free to stop using the Service.</li>
          <li>The Service is only available to users who register with a valid mobile phone number in selected locations.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Joining and leaving the Service</h2>

        <h2>The Service and what you can expect from us</h2>
        <ol start="8">
          <li>O2 Wifi is a wireless LAN data service which allows you to access data services while you're near one of our [hotspots].</li>
          <li>If you're within an appropriate distance of one of our hotspots (usually no more than 25 metres), you can connect to the Service using your compatible phone or computer device ("Equipment"). The Equipment must be able to use wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11b or later). If you don't have compatible Equipment then the Service will not work for you. You may only have five different pieces of Equipment registered to use the Service at any time.</li>
          <li>The Service is intended for e-mail, instant messaging, browsing the internet, using apps and accessing corporate intranets.</li>
          <li>The service may be subject to content filters which either prohibit or require age verification to access content on the internet which we may classify is suitable for over 18s only. We will use our discretion to determine what is or isn't adult content. If you do not agree with our classification you can contact us at admin@o2wifi.co.uk to raise concerns or obtain more information. Ultimately though, if you don’t agree with our classification then you are free to stop using the service at any time. The availability of content on the internet may vary from hotspot to hotspot.</li>
          <li>The Service is available at hotspots in locations around the UK. You should be able to use the Service at most hotspots. You may not be able to access it from all of them if certain venue operators have put restrictions on the Service. </li>
          <li>We'll do our best to provide uninterrupted access to the Service and whenever we can we'll let you know in advance if there's going to be any maintenance or other suspension of the Service on our website. But we may have to modify or temporarily suspend the Service or any part of it without giving you notice for emergency technical repairs.</li>
          <br>
	        We cannot be, and are not, responsible for the security of your information which includes without limitation data you transmit on the Service, nor are we responsible for the accuracy, completeness or timeliness of any information obtained through the Service from the Internet.

        <h3>Why do we have your personal information?</h3>
        <p>We collect information to help us manage your account:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>To deliver products and services to you (whether we provide them or not)</li>
         <li>To improve our products and services and develop new ones</li>
         <li>And to manage our network and help us run and grow our business</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also collect information so we can tell you about our products and services or allow partners we've chosen to tell you directly about their products. The law requires us to keep some information, too.</p>
        <p>Sometimes we create and anonymise information so you can't be identified.</p>
        <p>To find out more, click on any of the sections below.</p>

        <h3>The type of Information we have</h3>
        <p>Without some of your information, we couldn't do our job (or get better at it.) This includes things like who you are, where you are, and how you're going to pay for your services.</p>
        <p><strong>Who you are, which includes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
         <li>Your name, address, gender, age, interests and such.<br>You can find these in your MyO2 under <strong><a href="https://mymobile.o2.co.uk/mydetails" title="MyO2">My Details</a></strong> </li>
         <li>Your debit or credit card details, bank details and other payment information</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What you use your O2 products and services for</strong></p>
        <p>Your call, text, surfing and billing records (for example) Or any other products from us you use, like our apps - this includes the date and time you use them, how long for, where you use them and how much it costs. We don't look at the content of your messages or listen to your calls (unless you are talking to one of our customer service advisors).</p>
        <p><strong>Where you use our network</strong></p>
        <p>So we can connect you to our network, we need to know your location when you make or receive phone calls, messages or use the internet. We call this network location, it finds you through phone masts nearby and only knows roughly where you are so that we can put calls through or connect you to the Internet.</p>
        <p>Your smartphone might have also a Global Positioning System (GPS) location that is used by your phone and certain apps. It's more accurate than network location alone, because it uses satellites. We don't use your GPS location for calls, messages or internet access, generally. It's only if you're using some of our apps, like Priority Moments, that we might collect some of your GPS location information.</p>
        <p><strong>What you do with your O2 account(s)</strong></p>
        <p>This includes things like when and how much you top up and pay your bill or how often and why you access your account with us.</p>
        <p><strong>How you use O2 Money</strong></p>
        <p>For example: what you use O2 Money products and card services for. And what payments and transactions are going through at shops and with our partners.</p>

        <h3>Where do we get your information?</h3>
        <p>We collect information mainly when you sign up with us, contact us and when you use our products and services.</p>
        <p>For example when you::</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Register as an O2 customer or take part in market research</li>
         <li>Get in touch with us to ask something</li>
         <li>Buy from us – whether it's in one of our shops, online, over the phone or somewhere else</li>
         <li>Enter any promotions, competitions or prize draws through one of our services</li>
         <li>Make changes to or close your O2 account</li>
         <li>Go to our website, or the sites of any other companies in the Telefónica Group</li>
         <li>Use any of our networks – mobile, wifi or other O2 products and services</li>
         <li>Sign up for a service with us and we need to check with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies</li>
         <li>Apply for a job with us online</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also collect information from other sources, including business directories and other commercially or publicly available sources.</p>

        <h3>How we use your information</h3>
        <p>We use and analyse your information to keep in touch with you and to supply and improve our products and services. Sometimes we'll aggregate and anonymise this information so you won't be identified as an individual.</p>
        <p>In particular this means using your information to:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Give you access to parts of the O2 website, like MyO2</li>
         <li>Sort out a payment, put your order through our system or send you anything you order</li>
         <li>Get in touch with you (like if we need to tell you about any problems with a service, or help you with any questions you have about our services or products)</li>
         <li>Keep things secure and prevent crime and fraud</li>
         <li>Look into any complaints or questions you may raise</li>
         <li>Check whether you qualify for credit. This is so we can assess and decide on whether we can give you (and members of your household) credit, credit-related services, other similar facilities or insurance.</li>
         <li>Trace and recover debts, manage credit, detect and prevent fraud and money laundering</li>
         <li>Recover any money you might owe us</li>
         <li>Assign your debt to permitted third parties. And look after any credit you might have</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Or to:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Tell you if we've changed the way a service works. Or tell you about a new service that we think may interest you</li>
         <li>Check what you're interested in, so we can offer (and develop) products and services you're actually interested in</li>
         <li>Look at markets. Write reports. Do research and number crunching. And (if the law allows it) look at information about you (including the calls you make, your spending, what you use the internet for and where you are when you do it). As an individual or as a group</li>
         <li>Send you information about our products and services (or those from chosen third parties we think you'd be interested in).By phone, post, email, text, picture message, online banner advertising, or other ways – unless you opt out</li>
         <li>Tell you about products and services from other companies we think you'd be interested in, or let chosen third parties tell you directly about their products and services. You can opt out of messages like this too</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How we share your information</h3>
        <p>To run our business and provide you with our services, we may share your information with others.</p>

         <li>Our partner companies or agencies and their sub-contractors or prospective partners who help us run our services, for example our <a href="http://www.ibm.com/uk/en" title="IBM">billing</a> or <a href="http://www.capita.co.uk" title="Capita">customer service centres</a></li>

For example, location information is used by apps like our <a href="http://www.o2priority.co.uk/moments" title="Priority Moments">Priority Moments</a> .

         <li>With any public authority or law enforcement agency (if they ask for it)</li>
         <li>To comply with law or regulations. Or for possible legal proceedings</li>
         <li>If you give us personal information that's wrong or we find out (or think) you're responsible for fraud</li>
         <li>If one of our partners who are processing information for us are compelled to do so by law</li>
         <li>If there's an emergency and we think you or other people are at risk.</li>

        <h3>We keep hold of your information</h3>
        <p>There are certain reasons we have to keep hold of your information.</p>
        <p>We keep information while you're our customer or after you've left us, but only as long as we need it. How long we keep it depends very much on the type of information and purpose. For example, we might need to sort out disagreements, stop fraud and abuse, prove that you had an account with us or follow our legal obligations. Or if the police needs it as evidence. We may also keep information about how you use our products or services.</p>

        <h3>Want to check and update your information?</h3>
        <p>It's your information. Just ask if you want a copy.</p>
        <p><strong>Your personal information</strong></p>
        <p>Go to o2.co.uk and <a href="https://accounts.o2.co.uk/signin" title="sign in to My O2">sign in</a> to My O2'(link to: https://accounts.o2.co.uk/signin) to look at your personal information. You can change how we get in touch with you – and your account details – whenever you like.</p>
        <p><strong>Marketing communications</strong></p>
        <p>If you don't want us or our partner companies to send you relevant offers or marketing information, you can opt out anytime via your PC in <strong>My O2</strong>, by clicking on the <strong>My Choices</strong> link in the My Mobile section. These changes can only be made using your PC - you won't be able to see this option if you are accessing My O2 via the app or the mobile website on your phone.</p>
        <p><strong>Your location</strong></p>
        <p>Network location uses our network to find your phone so we can connect your call. If you don't want us to share your network location for some or all of your services, call us on 1300. It's free from your O2 mobile. </p>
        <p>GPS location is different network location. We don't control it, so there's no need to call 1300. GPS is based on satellites and is set up on the mobile phone itself. Look at your phone's settings to configure it.</p>
        <p>Please remember, if you choose not to share your location you might not be able to use certain services that need to know where you are in order to work.</p>
        <p><strong>Find out more about your information</strong></p>
        <p>If you want, we can send you the information we have about you. There are a couple of ways to do this and some requests have to be in writing because of legal requirements. Details on how to do this <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk/help/everything-else/how-to-get-a-copy-of-the-information-we-store-about-you#qs">can be found here</a>.</p>
