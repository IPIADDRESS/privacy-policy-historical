</ul>
<p>We may also share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.</p>

<p>For example, we may use Google Analytics or other remarketing tools to advertise online. This enables third-party vendors, including Google, to show our ads on sites across the Internet. &nbsp;Such third-party vendors, including Google, may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our Site. &nbsp;For information on how you can opt out of Google’s use of cookies for interest-based ads please visit Google’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Ads Settings</a>.</p>
