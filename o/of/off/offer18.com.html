<h6 class="heading-alt">Tracking systems on our Website : </h6>


<h6 class="heading-alt">Facebook Social Plugins</h6>
<p>

This website uses social plugins (“plugins”) from the social network facebook.com which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). The plugins are identified by one of the Facebook logos or the amendment “Facebook social plugin”. The list and the look of the Facebook social plugins can be viewed here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.

If you access a page on our website that includes such a social plugin, your browser sets up a direct connection to the Facebook servers. Facebook transfers the social plugin’s content directly to your browser which will then integrate it into the website. Therefore we have no influence on the extent of the data that Facebook collects via its social plugins, and thus, can only inform you based on our state of knowledge: Through integration of the plugin, Facebook obtains the information that you have accessed the respective page on our website, even if you are not a registered user of Facebook or are not logged into Facebook. This information as well as your browser’s IP address is transferred to Facebook’s server in the United States and is being stored there. According to Facebook, only anonymized IP addresses are stored from non-registered users in Germany. If you are logged in to Facebook, Facebook can allocate the visit to our website to your Facebook account. Facebook receives such information irrespective of whether you interact with the social plugins or not. If you do interact with the social plugins, e.g. by using the «Like-it-Button» or by posting a commentary, your browser will transfer such information directly to Facebook where it is being stored. Such information will also be published on Facebook and be displayed to your Facebook friends. For information on the purpose and extent of data collection, the further processing and use of such data by Facebook, as well as your rights in this regard and your setting options for the protection of your privacy, please refer to Facebook’s privacy policy: http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy

If you are a Facebook member and do not want Facebook to collect data on you via our website and to combine such data with your Facebook membership data, you need to log off from Facebook before accessing our website. Furthermore, you may also block social plugins by downloading and installing add-ons for your browser, such as the Facebook blocker: http://webgraph.com/resources/facebookblocker/
