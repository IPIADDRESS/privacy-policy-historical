  From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys  or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary  but the information collected may be disclosed as per this privacy agreement.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name  and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact  information will be used/shared with the contest/survey sponsors (if any) to  notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for  purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.  Unless mentioned in this privacy policy, users' personally identifiable  information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and  choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests,  they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary  purposes. <br>
  www.officialemailmarketing.com can not be liable for the actions of any  "friend" who may give out your personal information, other than what  is permitted in this privacy policy. Any abuse of this service will lead to  suspension or termination of use of this website. </p>
<p><strong>Security </strong> <br>
  This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is  protected both online and off-line. <br>
  When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive  information, if ever applicable, (such as credit card number and/or social  security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best  encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our  order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape  Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to  un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. <br>
  While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we  also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of  our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is  restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a  specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service  representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a  secure environment. <br>
  www.officialemailmarketing.com will make every effort to protect your  information. However, www.officialemailmarketing.com can't be liable (for any  damages whatsoever) for security breaches that occur outside of www.officialemailmarketing.com. <br>
  If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users  can contact us on our web site. </p>
<p><strong>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information </strong> <br>
  If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip  code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our  service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users'  personally identifiable information. This can usually be done on line with www.officialemailmarketing.com. </p>
<p><strong>Notification of Changes </strong> <br>
  If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to  this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so  our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and  under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in  accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. <br>
  If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable  information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we  will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we  use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted  out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account,  then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in  this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy  practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database,  we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change.  In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted  to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy  practices. </p>
