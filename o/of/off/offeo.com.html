<p><strong>1.4&nbsp;</strong><strong>Basic Account Information</strong>: When you create or reconfigure an account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, email address or phone number with OFFEO. On the OFFEO Services, your name, username and company name are listed publicly, including on your profile page and in search results, and you can only use your real name.</p>
<p><strong>1.5&nbsp;</strong><strong>Contact Information</strong>: You may use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to customize your account or enable Services, for example, for login verification. If you provide OFFEO with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages to that number from OFFEO. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, to market to you, to help prevent spam, fraud, or abuse, and to help others find your account, including through third-party services and client applications. You may use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from the OFFEO Services.</p>
<p><strong>1.6&nbsp;</strong><strong>Additional Information</strong>: You may provide us with profile information to make public on the OFFEO Services, such as a short biography, your location, your web site, or a picture. You may choose to upload your address book so that we can help you find users you know or help other users find you. We may later make suggestions to you and other users based on imported address book contacts. You can delete your imported address book contacts at any time. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your account on our Services to your account on another service in order to cross-post between our Services and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from our Services within a few weeks of your disconnecting from our Services your account on the other service.</p>
<p><strong>1.7&nbsp;</strong><strong>Location Information</strong>: OFFEO may receive information about your location. We may also determine location by using other data from your device, such as precise location information from GPS, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as posting with your location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local offers, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to connect with. We may also share your data with other services like Google Maps that will help us to determine your exact location.</p>
<p><strong>1.8&nbsp;</strong><strong>Links</strong>: OFFEO may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
<p><strong>1.9&nbsp;</strong><strong>Cookies</strong>: Like many web sites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional web site usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile device. OFFEO may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the web sites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>
<p><strong>1.10&nbsp;</strong><strong>Log Data</strong>: When you use our Services, we may receive information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information ("<strong>Log Data</strong>"). We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our web sites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, or visit a third-party web site. We may also receive Log Data when you click on, view or interact with links on our Services, including links to third-party applications. OFFEO uses Log Data to provide, understand, and improve our Services. If not already done earlier, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after a maximum of 18 months.</p>
<p><strong>1.11</strong><strong>&nbsp;Subscriptions</strong>: You may provide your payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address (collectively, "<strong>Payment Information</strong>"), to complete a commerce transaction with our Services. To facilitate future transactions, we store your Payment Information, excluding CVV code, and billing address, which you can remove from your account at any time using your account settings. We consider your Payment Information and billing address private and do not make such information public. We collect and store information created by your subscriptions made with us ("<strong>Transaction Data</strong>"). OFFEO may also use a third party service to store the credit or debit card data or other data needed for future payments. OFFEO will each time inform about the third party data handler.</p>
<p><strong>2. Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1</strong><strong>&nbsp;Disclosure:&nbsp;</strong>OFFEO discloses personal data (a) for the primary purpose for which it was collected or (b) for purposes that a reasonable person will consider appropriate in the circumstances or (c) where the individual has consented or (d) for direct marketing by OFFEO where consent has been given but giving individuals the opportunity to opt out of such direct marketing or (e) where permitted under the PDPA or other applicable law or if required by law.</p>
<p><strong>2.2</strong><strong>&nbsp;Limits to Disclosure</strong>: OFFEO does not disclose your personal data for any secondary purposes unless your consent has been given or if so permitted or required under PDPA or other applicable laws and regulations. OFFEO will not sell or license any personal data that it collects from an individual. When a situation arises where OFFEO may collect and use personal data, which are outside a person's reasonable expectation, OFFEO is committed to providing the individual with an explanation for the possible use of the personal data when asking for the individual's consent.</p>
<p><strong>2.3&nbsp;</strong><strong>Service Providers</strong>: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in Singapore. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We share your Payment Information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit or debit cards. We may share your credit or debit card number with payment services providers or card networks to monitor card transactions at participating merchants and track redemption activity for the purposes of providing card-linked services.</p>
<p><strong>2.4&nbsp;</strong><strong>Law</strong>: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect OFFEO’s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.</p>
<p><strong>2.5</strong><strong>&nbsp;Business Transfers and Affiliates</strong>: In the event that OFFEO is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.</p>
<p><strong>2.6</strong><strong>&nbsp;Withdrawal of Consent &amp; Access</strong></p>
<p>2.6.1 You may withdraw your consent to our continued use and disclosure of your personal data or seek access to your Personal data (to a reasonable extent and as permitted by PDPA) at any time by writing to our data controller. You may also withdraw your consent for specific forms of communication and on specific communications via the unsubscribe options as stated on our email or other marketing messages.</p>
<p>2.6.2 In withdrawing your consent, you acknowledge that we may not be able to provide or continue providing certain goods and/or services to you and that we may cease such provision accordingly without any liability. Please note that it may take up to <strong>30 working days</strong> for any request for consent withdrawal to be reflected in our systems.</p>
<p>2.6.3 We will, at your request, endeavour to provide you with an account of your Personal data in our possession or control within a reasonable time. Such account shall be in respect of how your Personal data has been or may have been generally used or disclosed within the year before the date of your request. We reserve the right to charge a reasonable administrative fee for carrying out your request.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>3.1 If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct, delete, or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.</p>
<p>3.2 You can also permanently delete your OFFEO account. If you follow the instructions here or send us a request to <a href="mailto:hello@offeo.com"><strong>hello@offeo.com</strong></a>, your account will be deactivated and then deleted.
