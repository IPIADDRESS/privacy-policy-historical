 Privacy Policy </h1> <p>
 Last updated: October 2017 </p> </div> <p>
1.	<strong>Marketing Punch Ltd </strong>(United Kingdom)(“we”,”us”) is the registered owner of these prize draw service websites and owns all rights, including the sites’ respective IP, copyrights and trademarks.  We are registered with the ICO office (The Information Commissioner's Office in the United Kingdom) as a Data Controller and Data Processor under the Trading Name Marketing Punch Ltd, with Registration Number Z1503626. <br> <br>
2.	This privacy policy applies to the following websites owned and operated by us (collectively to be called “the sites”: <br>
www.offerx.co.uk <br>
www.offerx.co.uk/gettestkeep<br>
www.adailyquiz.co.uk<br>
www.yourfreebiestyle.co.uk<br>
www.freecashpotlottery.co.uk <br> <br>
3. We are committed to protecting the security of the data that you provide us with and we will seek to ensure that your personal data, along with your consent usage permissions are handled and maintained in a secure and data-protection compliant environment at all times. <br> <br>
4. We seek to fully comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 and the Electronic EU Regulations 2011 as well with the forthcoming EU GDPR regulations expected to be in force in 2018. If you wish to find out more, please visit https://ico.org.uk/. </p> <br> <p><strong>Purpose of this Privacy Statement </strong></p> <p>
5. This statement discloses how we manage, use and protect their personal information obtained while using the sites.<br>
6. We will only use or share your personal information in a manner that is in accordance with this Privacy Statement, and as stated within the registration opt-in definition, unless we have obtained your prior consent. The consent statement is prominently displayed as part of the registration process on the sites. </p> <br> <p><strong>Collection and Use of Your Personal Information </strong></p> <p>
7.We collect personal information when you visit our websites. ‘Personal information’ or ‘personal data’ means the information you provide during the registration process and any information you provide when entering prize draws, quizzes, surveys or competitions. Registration is required to participate in any of the branded surveys on the site, however merely browsing does not require registration.<br>
8.	We may collect the following information on you:<br>
a.	Your name<br>
b.	Your title<br>
c.	Your date of birth<br>
d.	Your contact information, including email and phone numbers<br>
e.	Demographic information<br>
f.	Your address and postcode<br>
g.	Your IP address<br>
h.	Your response to specific surveys and questionnaires<br>
i.	Your consent to receive further marketing communications and us and our selected partners via various different media<br> </p><br> <p><strong>Use of Your Personal Information </strong></p> <p> 9.	We use your personal information collected via the Marketing Punch Scheme websites to:<br>
a.	Provide you with information about the products and services we offer<br>
b.	Provide you with a more personalised service<br>
c.	Conduct market research<br>
d.	Run prize draws and promotions<br>
e.	Pass on your details to selected companies which provide you with other offers and promotions of interest to you<br>
f.	Help other companies profile and extend their databases<br>
g.	Facilitate communication between yourself and others<br>
h.	For analysis purposes or to build data products. In these instances, the information is aggregated and wherever possible anonymised in line with the Information Commissioner’s code of practice. Again, these products are of a marketing nature.<br> <br>
10.	We may process your personal data ourselves or through data processors that will process data on our behalf (in which case we will remain responsible for ensuring the data processor complies with this policy and all current data protection regulations).<br>
11.	Depending on the consents that you set up at the time of registration and what personal information we hold about you, we may pass your personal information to Site Sponsors, Brand Partners or Data Partners (collectively third parties”) who may contact you by post, email and telephone for direct marketing purposes.<br>
12. Email and Telephone data will only be released to third parties where you have given your positive consent (usually at the time of registration) allowing you to fully understand your registration preferences.<br>
13.	You can change or update your communication preferences at any time here <a href="http://www.offerx.co.uk/communication-preferences-login" target="blank">http://www.offerx.co.uk/communication-preferences-login</a><br>
14.	Telephone data will only be released to carefully selected partners where it has been TPS’d (see section 45 below). Note : if you request a call from one of our sponsors or brand partners this will override the TPS.<br> </p><br> <p><strong>Profile Matching</strong></p> <p>
15. Our business is to match your profile to third companies that will have goods or services that will be of interest to you. It makes sense for us to ensure that you only receive offers that are relevant to you and fit within the context of your lifestyle and available purchasing power. For example, if you have provided your car insurance renewal data and have consented for third parties to contact you about one month before your renewal date, we will work with third party brand partners to send you a car insurance quote tailored to your needs – thus saving you time researching the entire market. <br>
16. The data that we provide our third parties may be added to the information that they already hold about you. So a car insurance company will check whether you have been a customer of theirs before. This is to ensure that they provide the right types of products, services and pricing to you. <br>
17.	When first contacting you, they always will seek your appropriate opt in and consent. <br>
18.	Data sharing in this way allows them to contact you in their own name about their products, services, promotions, offers and competitions, and/or to update their records for fraud prevention, debt tracing and anti-money laundering purposes. <br>
19.	We will share your data with the Marketing Services Providers listed below, who will use it to create products and services to help organisations better understand the likely characteristics of their customers; communicate with them more effectively; and find others like them across a range of marketing channels.  This may mean that you receive advertising that is more relevant to you via direct mail or when you visit a website.

20.	Our Brand Partners, both sponsors of the site and particular surveys, may wish to contact you based on your profile, but will only do so subject to your consent and preferences.

22. Your 'Registration Details' (and other details depending on which activities you chose to participate in on the Site) will be shared, by way of either single or multiple use data licences, with selected Data Partners who may then contact you by email, text message, telephone or post depending on the consents that you supplied us at the time of registration or subsequently.<br>
23.	We usually only permit Data Partners to use these details to contact you for a pre-specified limited period And they, like us, are obliged to comply with all relevant data protection requirements regarding their holding and use of these details including screening (according to the method used to contact you) against the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) and Mailing Preference Service (MPS) prior to use. Your IP address (see 'Cookies' section 49-52 for more details) will not be shared with our Data Partners unless you participate in their Branded Survey (see below).<br>

29.

We do not place a specific timeframe on their use of the Registration and Survey Details.<br>
30.	Please note as part of the registration process, and completing the relevant consent boxes, you are agreeing to be contacted by the companies running the Branded Surveys by the methods referred to above, including by telephone. This will take preference over any registration that you may have with the TPS (Telephone Preference Service) of the number you have provided to us or updated with us.
