General disclosure of personal information</h2><h3>
Personally identifiable information</h3><p>
We share personally identifiable information with selected third-parties. We also
share the information that you have answered in the questionnaires with the relevant
client. The clients and third parties use this to profile you, this enables them
to send you targeted communications.</p><p>
Once you register with OfferX you consent to OfferX Ltd, its clients and selected
third parties being able to send you communications via email, post or telephone.</p><p>
The collection of data by OfferX through registration on third party sites may lead
to your data also being held by that third party site.</p><p>
The data that you provide to OfferX is held by both OfferX and the sponsors, of
the questionnaires that you answer. OfferX holds your data in a central database
and this database is only accessed by reference to interest or demographic categories
in order to provide you with information about those interests you have selected.
The process of supplying you with this information is at all times under the control
of OfferX although specialist third party suppliers may carry out the dispatch.</p><h2>
Security and storage of your personal information</h2><p>
OfferX is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We
use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal
information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store
the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which
are located in controlled facilities.</p><p>
The Internet is not a 100% secure medium for communication and, accordingly, OfferX
cannot guarantee the security of any information you send to OfferX via the Internet.
OfferX is not responsible for any loss or damage you or others may suffer as a result
of the loss of confidentiality of such information.</p><h2>

âBy registering and entering your details you consent to OfferX, its clients
and third parties sending you information about products and/or services that have
been selected based on your stated interests. You also agree to the terms and conditions
of the privacy that govern how your information will be processed.â</p><p>
At times it may be appropriate for OfferX, its clients or sponsors to contact you
with offers and information in respect of your interests or to inform you about
subjects upon which you have requested information through your mobile phone or
other PDA devices.</p><p>
You give your consent that OfferX or any third party it provides data to may contact
you by post or telephone. Where your telephone number is not provided, OfferX or

behalf or in partnership with OfferX with an offer of their own, and may choose
not to suppress you against the Telephone Preference Service, whilst you are a member

Your data may be provided to clients of OfferX to be appended to information they
already hold about you for the purpose of contacting you with information about
their products and services. When first contacting you these clients will seek your
appropriate consent.</p><p>
OfferX may from time to time use third party suppliers to provide all or part of
a service to you. OfferX will only supply such of your personal information as is
necessary to enable them to provide the relevant service to you.</p><p>
You should be aware that such outside service providers might be based in countries
outside the European Union whose laws provide for a different standard of protection
for your personal data than that provided under English law. In such circumstance
