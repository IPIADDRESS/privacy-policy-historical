 When you are registering with the OfferX website, it is not until you click the submit button
 that your information is transferred to the website. Once you have completed and submitted all
 your details you have then "completed" the registration confirming you
 are a valued member of OfferX. </p> <p>
 Marketing Punch may use other reputable partners to provide its services in connection with
 your registration. However this will not affect your statutory rights under the Data
 Protection Act. </p> <h2>Winner Information</h2> <p>The winner will be notified by phone or e-mail after verifying their identity and address.</p> <h2>

 General disclosure of personal information </h2> <p>
 We share personally identifiable information with selected third-parties. We also
 share the information that you have answered in the questionnaires with the relevant
 client. The clients and third parties use this information so as
 to send you personally-tailored communications. </p> <p>
 Once you register with the OfferX website you consent to Marketing Punch Ltd, its clients and selected
 third parties being able to send you communications via email, post or telephone, until such times as 
 you exercise your right to opt-out of receiving such communications. </p> <p>
 The collection of data by Marketing Punch through registration on third party sites may lead
 to your data also being held by that third party site. </p> <p>
 The data that you provide to Marketing Punch is held by both Marketing Punch and the sponsors of
 the questionnaires that you answer. Marketing Punch holds your data in a central database
 and this database is only accessed by reference to interest or demographic categories
 in order to provide you with information about those interests you have selected.
 The process of supplying you with this information is at all times under the control
 of Marketing Punch although specialist third party suppliers may carry out the dispatch. </p> <h2>
 Security and storage of your personal information </h2> <p>
 Marketing Punch is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We
 use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal
 information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store
 the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which
 are located in controlled facilities. </p> <p>
 The Internet is not a 100% secure medium for communication and, accordingly, Marketing Punch
 cannot guarantee the security of any information you send to the OfferX website via the Internet.

 You give your consent that Marketing Punch or any third party it provides data to may contact
 you by post or telephone. Where your telephone number is not provided, Marketing Punch or

 Your data may be provided to clients of Marketing Punch to be appended to information they
 already hold about you for the purpose of contacting you with information about
 their products and services. When first contacting you these clients will seek your
 appropriate consent. </p> <p>
 Marketing Punch may from time to time use third party suppliers to provide all or part of
 a service to you. Marketing Punch will only supply such of your personal information as is
 necessary to enable them to provide the relevant service to you. </p> <p>
 You should be aware that such outside service providers might be based in countries
 outside the European Union whose laws provide for a different standard of protection
 for your personal data than that provided under English law. In such circumstance

 to be processed at least to a standard compliant with the Data Protection Act 1998. </p> <p>
 Except as provided above, Marketing Punch will not provide your personal information to any
 third party without your prior consent, however, under certain circumstances the
