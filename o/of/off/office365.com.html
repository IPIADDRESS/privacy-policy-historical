      </p><h3>What Are Cookies?</h3><p></p>
      <p>Cookies assign a unique identification to your computer and store the 
        details on your hard drive via a facility in your web browser. The cookie 
        does not contain any personally identifying information but does permit 
        our website to recognize you each time you return to the Office365 website. 
        On arrival your cookie then ‘handshakes’ with our system, 
        which identifies you and makes it faster for you to log in. If you do 
        not want to use “cookies”, most Internet browser programs 
        will permit you to turn them off. Should you do this, you will still be 
        able to access our website as normal. </p>
