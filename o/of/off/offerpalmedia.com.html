                    We hate spam more than you do!
                    <br><br>
                    Welcome to the Offerpal Media, Inc. web site (<a href="www.offerpalmedia.com">www.offerpalmedia.com</a>). Offerpal Media values the privacy of the users, subscribers, members, and others who visit and use the Offerpal Media Platform (collectively or individually, "you" or "Users").
                    <br><br>
                    By using the Offerpal Media Platform, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy, please do not use the Offerpal Media Platform.
                    <br><br>
                    This Privacy Policy should be read in connection with the Offerpal Media Terms of Use. Your use of the Offerpal Media Platform and any personal information you provide through the Offerpal Media Platform are subject at all time to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>1. The Information Offerpal Media Collects</h2>
                    User-provided Information: You may provide to Offerpal Media what is generally called "personally identifiable" information (such as your name, email address, postal mailing address, telephone number and billing information) if you upload or download certain content or products from the Offerpal Media Platform, enter contests or sweepstakes, take advantage of promotions, respond to surveys, register and subscribe for certain services, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the Offerpal Media Platform. You may also provide to Offerpal Media demographic information and information related to your favorite social networking site such as the name, address and description.
                    <br><br>
                    "Cookies" Information: When you access the Offerpal Media Platform, we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer. Offerpal Media may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Offerpal Media Platform. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Some of our business partners (e.g. advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Offerpal Media only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
                    <br><br>
                    "Automatically Collected" Information: When you access the Offerpal Media Platform or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This "automatically collected" information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique user ID, version of software installed, system type, screen resolutions, color capabilities, plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords, JavaScript enablement, the content and pages that you access on the Offerpal Media Platform, and the dates and times that you visit the Offerpal Media Platform, paths taken, and time spent on sites and pages.
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>2. Web Beacons</h2>
                    Our web pages may contain electronic image requests (called a "single-pixel gif" or "web beacon" request) that allow us to count page views and to access cookies. Any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are typically 1-by-1 pixel files, but their presence can usually be seen within a browser by clicking on "View" and then on "Source." We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters that we send to opt-in subscribers in order to count how many newsletters have been read. Offerpal Media web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any personally identifiable information about our web site visitors, they are just the technique we use to compile anonymous information about web site usage.
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>3. The Way Offerpal Media Uses Information</h2>
                    Offerpal Media uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Offerpal Media Platform, to allow us to charge and invoice you, as well as to track user-generated content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
                    <br><br>
                    We will use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major Offerpal Media Platform updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, or to contact you regarding any content that you have posted to or downloaded from the Offerpal Media Platform.
                    <br><br>
                    Offerpal Media uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Offerpal Media Platform works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.
                    <br><br>
                    Offerpal Media may use "Automatically Collected" information and "Cookies" information to: (a) automatically update the Offerpal Media application on your system; (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the Offerpal Media Platform; (c) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and (d) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>4. When Offerpal Media Discloses Information</h2>
                    Offerpal Media does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent. Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the Offerpal Media Platform or related sites becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.
                    <br><br>
                    We may disclose some limited User information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; validate credit card numbers; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist Offerpal Media in improving the Offerpal Media Platform and creating new services features. We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.
                    <br><br>
                    Offerpal Media may share aggregate statistical information gathered from you and other Users with advertisers, business partners, sponsor or other third parties. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of visitors visited a certain area on a web site or that Y number of men and Z number
                    <br><br>
                    Offerpal Media may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.
                    <br><br>
                    Offerpal Media also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; protect Offerpal Media from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Offerpal Media Platform; enforce the Terms of Use; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Offerpal Media, our Users, or others.
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
                    You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with Offerpal Media, in which case Offerpal Media will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Offerpal Media Platform. You may update, correct, or delete your user information and preferences on the account information page under "My Account - Account Settings".
                    <br><br>
                    We recommend you do not divulge your account password to anyone. Offerpal Media will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone call or e-mail. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES.
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>6. Our Commitment to Data Security</h2>
                    Offerpal Media uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Offerpal Media, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Offerpal Media makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
                    <br><br>
                    If Offerpal Media learns of a security systems breach, then we will attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Offerpal Media may post a notice on the Offerpal Media Platform if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.

                    IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE OFFERPAL MEDIA PLATFORM AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.
                    <br><br>
                    Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Offerpal Media does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age. If Offerpal Media learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Offerpal Media Platform, then Offerpal Media will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
                    <br><br>
