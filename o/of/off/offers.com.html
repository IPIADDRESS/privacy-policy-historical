    	<h3>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h3>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to respecting the privacy rights of users of the Offers.com services.  We have designed this policy to help you understand how we collect and use the information you decide to share, so that you make informed decisions when using the Offers.com services.</p>
    
        <p>If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@offers.com">support@offers.com</a>.</p>
    
        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>As with most websites, we collect the following two types of information:  (1) Personally identifiable information that is voluntarily provided by users (i.e., information that a user provides that allows us to identify and contact that user, such as their name, address or email), and (2)  Non-personally identifiable information (e.g., information that is automatically collected such as the type of web browser, IP address, etc., that does not by itself identify a specific individual).</p>
    
        <p>We only collect personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to us.  If you do not want this information to be collected by us, please do not submit it.</p>
    
        <h3>Account Registration</h3>
    
        <p>In order to become a registered member of Offers.com, you must register and create an account on Offers.com's website.  In creating an account, you are required to create a user name and password, and provide contact information (such as name, email address, city, country, ZIP/postal code, and a brief profile summary).  You have the option to provide additional personal or preference information to us.  We encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on Offers.com.</p>
    
        <h3>User Submissions</h3>
        <p>When you use Offers.com, you may perform and store searches and queries and transmit information through various channels.  We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features.  In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your contacts list.  When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.</p> 
    
        <p>Additionally, should a user contact Offers.com on their own initiative or respond to a communication from Offers.com, we may collect the information submitted.</p>
    
        <p>Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on Offers.com is a violation of the Offers.com Terms of Use and should be reported to <a href="mailto:support@offers.com">support@offers.com</a>.</p>
    
        <h3>Cookies, Log Files and Web Beacons</h3>
        <p>Like most websites, Offers.com uses cookies and web log files to track site usage.  A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows Offers.com to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser.  Like the information you enter at registration or in your profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the website.
    One type of cookie, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you've logged in to your Offers.com account.  The next time you visit the Offers.com website, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing member so that you will not need to log in before using the service.  If you log out of the Offers.com website you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account.  Another type of cookie, called a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Offers.com website.  Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.</p>
    
        <p>The cookies we use do not store any personally identifiable information about you. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies.  Please be aware, though, that if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features offered on our websites.</p>
    
        <p>Like most websites as part of the communication standards on the Internet, we use log files on our servers. These log files store various non-personally identifiable data regarding your visit with us, such as the internet protocol (IP) addresses, information regarding your browser, internet service provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, platform type, and number and identification of clicks. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Offers.com services.  Additionally, this information may also be used to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer the Offers.com services, or to display the content according to your preferences.  This and other anonymous information collected may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis.  The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law.</p>  
    
        <p>We also use standard Internet technology such as web beacons to track site usage.  Web beacons (also known as clear gifs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that function similar to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies.  Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in e-mail) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  Web beacons are used to track user navigation and usage patterns on our website, and to inform us as to the effectiveness of our content and/or communications.  Offers.com does not and cannot use web beacons to obtain personally identifiable information from your computer.  If a user follows a link on Offers.com (or in an email or newsletter from Offers.com) to a third-party website, we may use a cookie or web beacon to assign an anonymous, unique identifier to the user's browser to track the user's non-personally identifiable activities on that site, including whether the user clicks on a link, or makes a purchase.  If the user re-visits the third-party site directly, we are able to continue to track the user's non-personally identifiable activities on that site.</p>
        
        <p>These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads.  Offers.com NEVER provides personally identifiable information to any advertiser nor any third-party without your express permission.</p>
    
    
        <h3>Coupon Codes and Links to Merchants</h3>
        <p>When clicking on coupon codes or other links to merchants on the Offers.com site, you will be sent, via a new Web browser window, directly to the merchant's site to complete your transaction.</p>
    
        <h3>Contests and Survey</h3> 
        <p>From time to time, we may offer our members and other visitors the option to participate in contests or surveys.  If you would like to participate, we may ask you for contact information, preferences, or other information.  Such information is used for purposes such as to conduct research, improve our offerings and services, or award prizes. Our contests may have separate contest rules and we identify how the information that you may supply will be used in each case.</p>
    
        <h3>Children</h3>
        <p>No one under age 18 is eligible to use our services, and we do not direct any of our content specifically at children who are under 18 years of age.  Offers.com does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register.  If you are under 18, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.  No one under age 18 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Offers.com.  In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 18, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.  If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@offers.com">support@offers.com</a>.</p>
    
        <h3>Information Use</h3>
        <p>Offers.com uses information obtained from its users and other visitors as described in this Policy, with the primary goal being to enhance user's experiences on the Offers.com website.  We may use this information to deliver the services requested by users, to provide users with technical support, to enforce our Terms of Use, to communicate with users, to develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests, and to manage our business operations.  We may use information to perform other functions as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.  Offers.com may use information collected (without identifying you as an individual) to third-parties for purposes of aggregating data.  We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.</p>
    
        <p>Information that does not personally identify you as an individual that is collected by Offers.com from the site (such as, by way of example, patterns of utilization) is exclusively owned by Offers.com. This information can be utilized by Offers.com in such manner as Offers.com, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.</p>
    
        <h3>Communications with Offers.com</h3>
        <p>Offers.com will communicate with you through email and notices posted on the Offers.com website.  These include a series of up to 3 welcome emails that help inform new members about various features of the service.  Please be aware that you will always receive certain emails from Offers.com related to the proper functioning of your account, such as email notices alerting you when your registration is confirmed.  Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.  We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.  We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.</p>
    
        <p>Offers.com may also send you promotional information unless you have opted out of receiving such information.  Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications.  If you wish to opt-out of receiving promotional emails, please send a request to <a href="mailto:support@offers.com">support@offers.com</a>.</p>
    
        <h3>Information Sharing</h3>
        <p>Offers.com takes the privacy of our users very seriously.  We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to any third-parties for marketing purposes without your express permission.  Offers.com will only share collected information for the limited purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>Offers.com also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Offers.com believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our website, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Offers.com, our members or others.</p>
    
        <p>We may also share non-personally identifiable information with advertisers, business affiliates, publishers and other third parties for marketing purposes.

We may segment our users by attributes such as geographic location, industry or trade, etc.  If you would like to be excluded from the aggregated research or services based upon aggregated data about our users' activities on the site, please email customer service at <a href="mailto:support@offers.com">support@offers.com</a>.</p>

Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
