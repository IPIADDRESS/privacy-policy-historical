		to give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us.
		For more information, see the “Navigation” section of
		this Privacy Policy below.</p>
		<p>We
		request information from you (which may include your name, address,
		telephone number, email address, age, gender and, when necessary,
		credit card information) when you:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Register
			or set up an account</p></li>

		</ul>
		<p>In
		order to better understand your preferences and better serve you, we
		may combine information you give us online with other information
		from Otixo sources, transactions and communications. We may also
		combine that information with data that is publicly available and
		data that we receive from other reputable sources.  All data combined
		and stored with online data is protected by this Privacy Policy. 
		</p>
		<p>To
		provide you with certain social features, we may collect information
		about your contacts or friends from third party websites that provide
		access to this information, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, or
		email services.  We respect and follow the privacy policies of those
		third party services with regard to the data we collect from them.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b>USING
		INFORMATION</b></p>
		<p>We
		may use the information we collect to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Customize
			and/or personalize your communications and shopping experience</p></li>
			<li><p>Better
			respond to your customer service inquiries</p></li>
			<li><p>Communicate

		</ul>
		<p>We
		will not use your personal information to advertise or communicate
		promotional offers, directly or indirectly, using direct mail
		marketing or telemarketing, unless you give us permission to do so.</p>
		<p>We
		may extend any of our rights under this Privacy Policy to third
		parties performing services on our behalf.</p>

		<p><b>SHARING
		INFORMATION</b></p>
		<p>We
		may enable other users of our site and third parties to view or
		receive information from your profile, subject to your permission to
		share this information.  These third-parties may include social
		networking providers such as Facebook, Linked-In, Twitter and
		MySpace, as well as individual subscribers to these third-party
		services.  With your permission, we may publish or distribute
		selected information about you, such as your recommendations,
		interests and other data of possible interest to other users of our
		site and third parties.</p>
		<p>For
		the purpose of operating our business, we may transfer information
		between Otixo and our preferred service providers who use that
		information only to conduct Otixo business. For example, they may
		handle our credit card processing, shipping, data management, email
		distribution, market research, information analysis, and promotions
		management.  We provide our preferred service providers with the
		information they need to perform their services and work with them to
		respect and protect your information. 
		</p>
		<p>From
		time to time we might establish a business relationship with
		carefully selected persons or companies whom we believe trustworthy.
		In such cases we might share and cross-reference information,
		including personally identifiable information about you that will
		enable such persons or entities to contact you regarding products and
		services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not
		share any information with these companies, please contact us
		(info@otixo.com) to update your privacy settings.</p>
		<p>We
		may provide your information to our wholly-owned companies and
		affiliates, which may be outside the United States.  We may also sell
		or transfer your personal information to third parties in connection
		with any merger, acquisition, reorganization, change in capital
		structure or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Otixo.</p>
		<p>We
		may provide information to other companies for purposes such as
		reporting and marketing.  We may sell or transfer non-individualized
		information to third parties, including summary or aggregated
		anonymous information about all or sub-groups of users of our site.</p>
		<p>On
		rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon
		governmental request, in response to a court order, when required by
		law, to enforce our website policies, or to protect our or others'
		rights, property, or safety. We may also share information with
		companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not
		provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or
		commercial purposes.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b>PROTECTING
		YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>
		<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>
		We use a variety of security measures, including
		sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to maintain the
		safety of your personal information. Your personal information is
		contained behind secure networks and is only accessible to a limited
		number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and
		are required to keep the information confidential. When you place
		orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a
		secure server. All credit card information you supply is transmitted
		via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our
		databases to be accessed only as stated above. We will use the
		information for purposes of processing and completing only those
		transactions you approve, and the information will be disclosed to
		third parties only as necessary to complete a specific transaction. 
		Regardless of these efforts, no data transmission over the Internet
		can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

		Our site may contain hypertext links to the websites of
		one or more third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy
		practices or the content of these other websites.</p>
		<p>Advertising
		agencies, advertising networks, and other companies who may place
		advertisements on our site may use their own cookies, pixel tags, web
		beacons, web bugs and other technology to collect information about
		you.  We do not control these companies' use of such technology and
		we have no responsibility for the use of such technology by these
		companies to gather information about you.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b>NAVIGATION</b></p>
		<p>Like
		other interactive websites, we collect information about your use of
		our site and our services using cookies, log files, and techniques
		used to track who is reading a web page or e-mail, when, and from
		what computer, such as web bugs, web beacons or pixel tags.    
		</p>
		<p>A
		cookie is a small removable data file that is stored by your web
		browser on your computer. Cookies allow you to place an order on our
		website and allow us to enhance and personalize your online browsing
		and shopping experience.</p>
		<p>For
		example, we use cookies to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Recognize
			you when you return to our website</p></li>
			<li><p>Analyze
			visitor behavior</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p><br>
		</p>
		<p>You

		settings. 
		</p>
		<p>Pixel
		tags, also known as web beacons or web bugs, are tiny graphic images
		(referred to here as “<b>GI</b>”)
		that are unobtrusively placed on a website or in an e-mail. When the
		HTML code for the GI points to a site to retrieve the image, it
		simultaneously passes information to the our servers, such as the IP
		address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time and
		duration the GI was viewed, the type of browser that retrieved the
		image, and previously set cookie values.  
		</p>
		<p>We
		use GI to help us analyze your online behavior. We may use GI to
		collect information about your visit, including the pages you view,
		the links you click and other actions taken in connection with our
		sites and services. We also collect certain standard information that
		your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP
		address, browser type and language, access times and referring web
		site addresses.  We also use GI to allow us to send you email in a
		format you can read and to let us know when you have opened an email
		message from us.</p>
		<p>We
		also work with other companies who use tracking technologies to serve
		ads on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect
		non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our
		website and your interaction with our communications, including
		advertising. If you would like to opt-out of allowing third party
		companies to collect non-personally identifiable information about
		you during your visits to our site, please contact us
		(info@otixo.com) to update your privacy settings.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b>HOW
		TO REVIEW, MODIFY OR DELETE YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>

		want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you
		prefer not to receive information from us or would like to update or
		change your personal information or preferences, follow the
		instructions below to review, modify or delete your personal
