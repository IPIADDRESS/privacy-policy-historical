<p>Effective as of September 1, 2016</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Gateway Blend, LLC, a Missouri corporation (“Odometer”) collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (“you,” “your,” or “User”) of its www.odometer.com website, platforms, applications, and any derivative or affiliated websites on which this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively, the “Site”).

You understand that you have the affirmative obligation to check this Privacy Policy periodically for changes, and you hereby agree to periodically review this Privacy Policy for such changes. The continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes an acceptance of those changes.</p>
<p>Odometer is based, and this website is hosted, in the United States of America.

<p>If you are opposed to any of the terms listed below, we ask that you please abstain from using Odometer.</p>
<h3>1. Information Collected</h3>
<p>Odometer understands the importance of maintaining your privacy, and strives to provide services with your security in mind.

<h3>2. Information Disclosure</h3>
<p>By reading this, you acknowledge and accept that Odometer is not responsible for information that may be intercepted while being transferred through the Internet.

Please make sure you take time to read the privacy practices of these websites as well.</p>
<p>Odometer collects personally identifiable information, such as your name and e-mail address, with your knowledge and consent and uses your personal information to administer the Site and deliver the services you have requested. Odometer may use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Odometer and its affiliates. Odometer may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.</p>
<p>The Site automatically collects certain technical information, such as the Internet address from which you visit the Site and your browser type. Odometer compiles this information in aggregate form to help diagnose problems with servers and to gather broad demographic information. Odometer may use Internet addresses for identification purposes only when necessary to enforce compliance with the Odometer Site Terms of Use and to protect its service or any person, as otherwise permitted by law.</p>
<p>Odometer will not sell, trade, lend or otherwise voluntarily disclose any personal information that you have provided for any purpose not identified under this Privacy Statement.

<h3>3. How This Information is Used</h3>
<p>Your personal information may be accessed by affiliates of Odometer, such as our parent company, subsidiaries, or joint ventures, that are currently with us or have the potential to be with us in the future. These affiliates are obligated to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company obtains Odometer, that company will then possess your personal information. However, they too are under strict obligation to honor the claims of this privacy policy. Third parties that work with Odometer may receive submissions you make through the website, which may end up being published on their sites or platforms. This information includes your account name, but not your personal information, unless it was listed in the submission.</p>

<h3>4. Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
<p>Like most websites, the Site uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer that allows Odometer to recognize you as a User when you return to the Site using the same computer and web browser. Like the information you enter during account registration, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the Site. One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you have logged in to your Site account. The next time you visit our Site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to log in before using the Site. In order to access or change any of your private information, you must log in with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. Additionally, if you log out of the Site you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser. You can choose to disable cookies on your browser or allow your browser to notify you when a cookie is being sent, however this may prevent you from utilizing certain features of the Site.</p>
<h3>5. Security of Personal Information</h3>
<p>Odometer maintains reasonable and appropriate measures to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Odometer secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled environment. You are responsible for ensuring that the computer systems that you use to access the Site have appropriate security controls enabled and you expressly assume the risk of any unauthorized disclosure or intentional intrusion, or of any delay, failure, interruption or corruption of data or other information transmitted in connection with the use of the Site. You are solely responsible for providing, maintaining and ensure compatibility of all hardware, software, electrical and other physical requirements necessary for your access to and use of the Web Site, or any part thereof.</p>
<p>Information about Users that is maintained on Odometer’s systems is protected using industry standard security measures. In order to secure your personal information, access to your data is password-protected, and sensitive data is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and the Site. However, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and Odometer cannot guarantee that the information submitted to, maintained on or transmitted from its systems will be completely secure. Odometer is not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site by any Users or third parties.</p>
<p>Odometer is not responsible for the acts and omission of any third parties related to the security of your connection to the Web Site.</p>
<h3>6. Privacy Policy Enforcement</h3>
<p>To enforce our privacy policy or to comply with a legal investigation, any information, including personal information, may be referenced. In compliance with legal procedures such as warrants, statutes, or court orders, your personal information may be distributed to third parties, to take action against illegal activities or to enforce our privacy policy. Odometer is not obligated to question the legitimacy of any government request.</p>
<h3>7. Compliance with the California Privacy Protection Act; DO NOT TRACK</h3>
<p>If you are a California resident and have provided personal information to Odometer through the Web Site, you are entitled by law to request certain information regarding any disclosure that may have been made by Odometer to third parties of personal information for their direct marketing purposes.

Odometer is required to respond to only one request per customer each year, and is not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the above email address.</p>
<p>We will not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes if you request that we do not do so. If you would like more information about not having your information used by third parties, or if you would like to make such an opt-out request, you may send us an email at hello@odometer.com.</p>
<p>You may also request to opt-out of an advertiser’s use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance. You may request to opt-out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences">www.google.com/ads/preferences</a>. All applicable terms on these websites will apply to your request to opt-out in addition to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>When contacting us, please indicate your name, address, email address, and what personal information you do not want us to share with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Please note that there is no charge for controlling the sharing of your personal information or for processing this request. At this time, Odometer is unable to universally respond to “Do Not Track” or other “opt-out” mechanisms that have been activated by a user through their web browser, and except as otherwise provided herein, does not alter its policies if a user activates such mechanism.</p>
