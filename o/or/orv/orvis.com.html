<p><img src="/orvis_assets/corpimg/header_privacy.gif" alt="Privacy Policy Statement" width="600" height="95"></p>
<p class="style1"> Welcome to the Orvis website. Because your privacy is very important to us, we want you to understand our practices with regard to collecting and using your information both online and offline and the steps we take to safeguard it. This statement applies to personally identifiable information collected from our customers. When this Privacy Policy uses the term "personally identifiable information," we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual’s name, postal address, e-mail address, credit card number, and telephone number. When other information, such as, for example, consumer product preferences, or number of children, is directly associated with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy. Personally identifiable information is sometimes referred to in this Privacy Policy as "personal information." </p>
<p class="style1"> We welcome any and all questions and feedback. For privacy-related issues, please contact us at: </p>

<p class="style1"> An IP address is often associated with the place from which you enter the Internet like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. </p>
<p class="style1"> This information is not personally identifiable and we do not combine this type of information with personally identifiable information. </p>
<p class="style2"> Use of Data We Collect </p>
<p class="style3"> a. Personally Identifiable Information </p>
<p class="style1"> At Orvis, we always want to provide you with the best possible shopping experience and fulfill your orders exactly as you've requested. In order to do this, we use your personally identifiable information to allow us to: </p>
<ul>
  <li class="style1"> Process and track your order </li>

<p class="style1"> Your e-mail address will be used only for the Orvis E-mail Newsletter and will not be shared with any third parties, except as described below. Instructions for unsubscribing are included in every e-mail. </p>
<p class="style3"> b. Aggregate Information </p>
<p class="style1"> We use the aggregate information that we collect from our customers in a manner that does not personally identify any individual. We use aggregate information to make our sites more interesting and useful to you. We also track the pages or documents accessed within our site. This information is collected for systems administration and 


for analyzing and improving the value of the material available on our website. This aggregate non-personal information is used to help our advertisers or our site design team create advertisements our guests might like.</p>
<p class="style1"> Orvis contracts with Coremetrics, an outside service that helps us better understand your use of orvis.com. Coremetrics places cookies on your computer so we can collect information related to your use of orvis.com. This information allows us to refine and improve the site for our customers. Coremetrics does NOT collect any credit card, user name or password information or any other personally identifiable information nor are they allowed to use data that they collect for us for any other purpose. Additionally, Coremetrics is contractually required to keep all the information collected for us in strict confidence. </p>
<p class="style1"> As a visitor to orvis.com, you may "opt out" of Coremetrics' collection of data. To learn more about your Coremetrics options go to <a href="http://www.coremetrics.com/info_eluminate2.html">http://www.coremetrics.com/info_eluminate2.html</a>. </p>
<p class="style2"> Information We Share with Others </p>
<p class="style3"> a. Our Contractors </p>
<p class="style1"> We contract with other companies (credit card processors, shippers, sweepstakes promoters, website developers and others) to provide certain services to Orvis to fulfill orders, provide sweepstakes and create or maintain our website. In some instances, these contractors may have access to personally identifiable information but they contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the information and to use it only for purposes of carrying out Orvis business. </p>
<p class="style1"> These companies are usually prohibited by contract from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than Orvis. For example, when you submit a “product review” to the Orvis website, your information will be received and managed by an independent contractor that organizes the reviews and manages that element of the Orvis website. Before you submit a review, you should review the “Terms of Use” and “Standards for Reviews” that are linked on the Orvis website so that you can understand the terms and conditions for acceptance and use of your information. </p>
<p class="style1"> In some instances, you may choose to deal with some of  these contractors directly and provide your personal information to them. In those instances, you should check the privacy policies on their independent websites to make sure you are willing to have your personal information handled to your satisfaction. </p>
<p class="style1"> For example, when you make a purchase from Orvis with a credit card, you may choose to use an independent card processor, such as Google Checkout, or a particular form of credit, such as Bill Me Later (“BML”). When these or similar choices are available, you will be notified about the option of checking their respective privacy policies, which will govern the collection and use of personal information that you give to them directly. </p>
<p class="style3"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="listremoval" id="listremoval"></a></font>b. Third Parties </p>
<p class="style1"> From time to time, we make our postal mailing list (names and postal addresses only) available to carefully screened companies whose products we believe will be of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share any information with these companies, please contact us at: </p>
<p class="style1"> The Orvis Company<br>
Attn: Customer Service: 1711 Blue Hills Drive, Roanoke, VA 24012<br>
888-235-9763 </p>
<p class="style1">We may also share your personally-identifiable information, including your name, address, e-mail address, as well as a record of any transactions you conduct on our website or offline with us, with a third-party advertising partner that we contract with, and its service providers, in order to deliver banner advertisements and other advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain websites. In these instances, it will use the data we provide it anonymously, that is, without any of your identifying information. Our advertising partner is able to do this, in part, by using “cookies” to collect anonymous information about your visits to our Website, and your interaction with our products and services. As with the information we provide, no personally identifiable information is collected in this process and no personal information will be shared further with any other party. To choose not to have this information used by our third-party advertising partner, <a href="http://usucmweb.dotomi.com/2182/optout.html" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
<p class="style1"> Your e-mail address is never shared with any third party (except as described above to our contractors who use it ONLY to carry out Orvis business and our advertising partner, also as described above.) </p>
<p class="style2"> Disclosure Exceptions </p>
<p class="style1"> Notwithstanding the above policies, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information to appropriate third parties if we are required to do so by law or we believe that such action is necessary: </p>
<ul>
  <li class="style1"> To comply with legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order; </li>
  <li class="style1"> To protect the company's rights and property; </li>
  <li class="style1"> To investigate reports of fraud or of users sending material using a false e-mail address or users sending harassing, threatening, or abusive messages; </li>
  <li class="style1"> To protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our web site; or </li>
  <li class="style1">During emergencies, such as when we believe
  

  
someone's physical safety is at risk </li>
</ul>
<p class="style2"> <strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="catalogunsubscribe" id="catalogunsubscribe"></a></font></strong>Your Choices </p>
