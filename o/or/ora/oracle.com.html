  </p><p><span class="parahead1"> 3. The Data We Collect and How We Use It<a name="personal"></a> 
</span><br><span class="bodycopy">Oracle collects information from users for the following purposes: 
</span></p><p> <span class="boldbodycopy">To engage in transactions or communications. </span><span class="bodycopy">Name, address, e-mail, purchase details, and credit card/payment information 
may be collected and stored as part of the transaction history. The majority 
of the information collected under this category is business contact information. 
Oracle may need to share some of this information (address, payment) with delivery 
services, credit card clearing houses and other similarly situated third parties 
that are required to accomplish the transaction. </span> 
</p><p> <span class="boldbodycopy">To provide future service and support. </span><span class="bodycopy">Information 

collected for this purpose is both contact information and information related 
to products and service/support requested. This information is also used to 
provide service, product update, and similar notices. </span> 
</p><p> <span class="boldbodycopy">As a result of product download. </span><span class="bodycopy">Users who download 
products under trial licenses and purchasers of products will be contacted to 
confirm they did not experience problems in the download process and will also 
be alerted at the end of the license period. These communications are not subject 
to the general opt-out of marketing notices.</span>
</p><p> <span class="boldbodycopy">To select content. </span><span class="bodycopy">Information may be collected 
to help create Web site content and navigation that is most relevant and user 
friendly. This includes information collected as a result of site navigation 
as well as information provided in forms. </span> 
</p><p> <span class="boldbodycopy">To respond to user inquiries and requests for information. </span><span class="bodycopy">This information includes registrations for newsletters and specific requests 
for further information. </span> 
</p><p> <span class="boldbodycopy">To provide various Oracle communities, such as partners, 

with relevant product alerts and updates. </span><span class="bodycopy">These updates are related to product releases, prices, terms, special offers and associated campaigns. This information is sent out as part of the partner signing up for the relevant program or online account and is not subject to general opt-out. </span> 

</p><p> <span class="boldbodycopy">To better tailor marketing to user needs. </span><span class="bodycopy">We may use information from purchases and requirements to provide you with timely and pertinent notices of product releases and service developments that address your needs and requirements. Marketing notices are subject to the general opt-out elections. </span> 

</p><p> <span class="boldbodycopy">To better respond to requests for service or quotes 
for product and equipment purchase. </span><span class="bodycopy">Oracle will pass contact information to the appropriate Oracle sales person, distributor, reseller, or consultant for follow-up related to your request. Oracle may also ask if you wish to have your contact information shared with other selected partners that offer complementary products or services related to your inquiry. If you agree, information is provided to those partners for purpose of responding to your request for service or information. Please review the privacy policy of the specific partner regarding any further interactions with them. </span> 

</p><p> <span class="boldbodycopy">To provide information on educational events or 
relevant partner products. </span><span class="bodycopy">We occasionally co-sponsor events with partners that provide services of potential benefit to Oracle users. We may provide information on such events and services to users that have provided information indicating interest in the subject matter or service. To help assure respect of your information, we maintain control of the information or limit the use of the information by these partners. </span> 

</p><p> <span class="boldbodycopy">To power joint sales or product promotions.</span><span class="bodycopy">Oracle and its partners may engage in joint events or provide bundled products. Such promotions will always reference the partners <a href="#promos" class="bodylink">involved</a><sup>4</sup>. 
 Both Oracle and the partner(s) will have access to that information. While we carefully choose our partners, privacy is a very subjective concern and we advise you to review the privacy policies of these partners. </span> 

</p><p> <span class="boldbodycopy">From referral/"tell a friend" function. </span><span class="bodycopy">If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address.
Oracle will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.
Oracle stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

The friend may contact Oracle at <a href="mailto:privacy_ww@oracle.com" class="bodylink">privacy_ww@oracle.com</a> to be removed from the referral program. </span>
</p><p> <span class="boldbodycopy">As a result of your registration for/attendance at an Oracle conference or event.</span><span class="bodycopy">Those existing customers or registered Oracle.com users, that sign up for such a conference or event, may be contacted prior to the event to see if any meetings, special demonstrations or other customer facilitation may be provided.This contact is in addition to any contact that may be required to confirm payment or provide logistical information and updates related to the conference.Attendees of such events may also be contacted after the event to see if any further information is required or follow up is appropriate. This information will be used only by Oracle or by designated partners and will not be released to other third parties.To help assure respect of your information we maintain central control of the information and require that use of the information by these partners is limited to that which is expressly relevant to your profile. Please consult the supplemental privacy statement on the specific conference site for more detailed information. </span>
</p><p> <span class="boldbodycopy">As a result of your participation in interactive 
discussions and public forums. </span><span class="bodycopy"> There are parts of the Web site that permit you to participate in interactive discussions. Some of these are moderated; all are subject to access for technical reasons. Oracle does not control the content that users post and some may serve as public discussion fora. As in all interactive fora open to many users, you should carefully consider whether you wish to submit personally identifiable information and should tailor any other content submitted appropriately. </span> 
</p><p> <span class="boldbodycopy">As a result of your use of Outsourcing, Support 
or Consulting Services "Hosted Services". </span><span class="bodycopy">Some 
Oracle customers may provide information on their employees, vendors, 
or customers using various Hosted Services including Oracle E-Business 
Suite Online that we host and for which we provide application and systems 
management. As a result of this Hosted Services relationship, Oracle may 
access or process some of this information, but does not control the information 
collection or use practices related to this information. Oracle merely 
provides the relevant hosting or application management and support services 
required by the engagement. Oracle makes no independent use of the information 
outside of what is needed to provide the hosting service, applications 
management, and support or to complete specific actions requested by the 
customer. For a complete statement of our privacy practices related to 

hosted services, please review our <a href="/html/privacy_hosted.html">hosted 
services policy</a> </span> 
</p><p> <span class="boldbodycopy">To address performance and fix issues. </span><span class="bodycopy">On occasion, patches and other fixes to software, such as security patches addressing newly discovered vulnerabilities, are developed by Oracle. We may communicate the availability of these patches or fixes to registered owners of software and parties who have identified themselves to us as users or developers. These communications will not contain marketing messages and will not be subject to general opt-out elections, due to the potential importance of these patches and fixes. </span>
</p><p><span class="boldbodycopy">As a result of legal requirements. </span><span class="bodycopy">Oracle may be required to provide personally identifiable information to comply with legally mandated reporting, disclosure or other legal process requirements. </span>
</p><p><span class="parahead1"> 4.Customization, Preferences and Opt-Out<a name="customization"></a> 
</span><br><span class="bodycopy">
Oracle allows visitors to self-select into communities, through the registration process, as a way to provide initial customization to the Oracle Web site. There are also plans to provide more control over preferences and information delivery in the registration process.
</span></p><p> <span class="boldbodycopy">Communications Choices. </span><span class="bodycopy">Oracle recognizes that users may not wish to be contacted about new or related products. Oracle.com allows you to opt-out of e-mail marketing that may result from use of the site. These choices may be made as part of the registration process or from links in marketing mailings. You may also always return to the registration profile to change your election relating to opt-out or by sending an email to our automated link <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@oracle-mail.com" class="bodylink">unsubscribe@oracle-mail.com</a>. 
If you have any problems in using these opt-out mechanisms, please send an e-mail 
to <a href="mailto:privacy_ww@oracle.com" class="bodylink">privacy_ww@oracle.com</a>, indicate opt-out in the subject line and specify what problem you have encountered in the body of the message. There are a few limited exceptions to the opt-out, but notice is provided that the service includes certain communications. These exceptions include: patch and product security update related communications, defined communications related to product download,specific communications that are part of the reason for a specific trading or user community - such as price/product related communications to the members of our partner network or trade opportunity postings on an exchange and some limited communications related to registration for and attendance at conferences. </span> 
</p><p><span class="boldbodycopy">Third Party Permission-Based Lists. </span><span class="bodycopy">On occasion, Oracle may use a third party permission-based list. These are lists maintained by third parties that have received permissionfrom their users to receive e-mails from other companies, such as Oracle. We do not have access to the names on these lists as the third party that has the direct relationship with their user maintains the list and the opt-outs, removes, and unsubscribes to those lists. We require that the list owners we use identify themselves as the mailers of the e-mail and provide appropriate opt-out mechanisms. While we advise users of third party websites to avail themselves of the opt-out functionality provided in the particular e-mail, should you have trouble opting out, or should you wish to make us aware of any issues related to the mailing, you may contact us directly at any of the addresses provided below.</span></p><p><span class="boldbodycopy">Information-Sharing Choices. </span><span class="bodycopy">Oracle only shares information with selected companies after providing users with an ability to either opt-out of or opt-in to the sharing. There are limitations to such opt-outs/opt-ins:in the case of joint sale or joint events where the information goes to both Oracle and the other party at the same time, where the customer has requested follow up which involves Oracle partners, and as needed with third parties 
required to accomplish the transaction including delivery and credit card clearing services. There may also be some cases of sharing by definition of the service - for example posting comments to a bulletin board or posting an opportunity to an exchange - that provides that information to all users.Other cases may include attendance at educational or conference events where third parties and Oracle partners may be involved in providing services or sponsorship of a conference, seminar, training session, or event. As we further develop our preference tools we will endeavor to have our partners join in their use to provide the user with a more seamless and streamlined environment. </span>

<br><span class="bodycopy">
Oracle uses some third parties to administer a limited set of Oracle advertisements on its Web sites. No personally identifiable information is passed back to the advertisers as part of this process, but aggregate profile information, such as user community, may be used in the selection of advertising to make sure that it has relevance to the user.
