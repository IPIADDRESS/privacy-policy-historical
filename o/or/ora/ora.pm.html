The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.</li></ul><h2 id="use" class="mb4">How do we use the information we collect</h2><ul><li><b>To provide the Services to you</b> — We use information about you to provide the Services to you, to authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate and maintain the Services. For example, we use the name and picture you provide in your account to identify you to other Ora users.</li><li><b>To provide, update, maintain and protect our Services and business</b> — This includes the use of Profile Information and User Content to support delivery of the Services, prevent or address service errors, security or technical issues, analyze and monitor usage, trends and other activities or at an Authorized User’s request.</li><li><b>As required by applicable law, legal process or regulation</b></li><li><b>To communicate with you by responding to your requests, comments and questions</b> — If you contact us, we may use information about you to respond.</li><li><b>To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights</b> — Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.</li><li><b>With your consent</b> — We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above.

In addition, we sometimes send emails about new product features, promotional communications or other news about Ora. These are marketing messages so you can control whether you receive them.</li><li><b>For billing, account management, and other administrative matters</b> — Ora may need to contact you for invoicing, account management and similar reasons and we use account data to administer accounts and keep track of billing and payments.</li><li><b>To investigate and help prevent security issues and abuse</b></li><li><b>Legal bases for processing (for EEA users)</b> — If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.

Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests.</p><ul><li><b>Access and update your information</b> — Ora gives you the ability to update and change your information.
