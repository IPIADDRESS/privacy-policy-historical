            Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            Orkin, Inc. is committed to protecting your privacy. That is why we have adopted
            this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is intended to describe how your personal
            information is processed and used, and we will make every effort to ensure that
            our activities keep with the spirit of this Privacy Policy. Please note that by
            visiting and using Orkin.com, you are accepting the practices described in this
            Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h3>
            What Information is Orkin, Inc. gathering about its visitors, and how is it being
            used?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Every computer connected to the Internet is provided with a domain name (e.g. earthlink.net)
            and an IP Address (e.g. 192.164.13.145). When a visitor requests a page from within
            the Orkin.com Web site, our Web Servers automatically identify and log the HTTP
            request that is made to our Web Server. This information reveals nothing personal
            about you. In fact, the only information that we automatically gather and log is
            as follows:</p>
        <p>
            The IP address of the site that may have referred you<br>
            Your IP address<br>
            The web page that you may have linked to us from, if any<br>
            The product identifier for version and make of browser (e.g. Internet Explorer 4.5)<br>
            The operating system platform that you may be running (e.g. Macintosh or Windows)<br>
            Search words or terms that are passed from a search engine (e.g. Google, Yahoo or
            Lycos)</p>
        <p>
            There is absolutely nothing special about the information just described, and the
            practice of collecting this data has been generally standardized by virtually every
            Web Server on the Internet today.</p>
        <p>
            The purpose for this information is actually two-fold. One, Orkin, Inc. has found
            it advantageous to examine visitor traffic in its aggregate so that we can ensure
            maximum compatibility for the various Browsers and Operating Systems that visit
            our site. Additionally, as any business should attest, it is our desire to generate
            greater amounts of visitor traffic. By analyzing visitation patterns, referring
            URLs and Search Engine terms, we can provide content that is relevant to our visitor’s
            requests and behavior.</p>
        
            <h3>What about Cookies?</h3>
       <p>
            Cookies are small pieces of data that are transferred to your computer's hard drive
            through your Web browser from our Web Server. A cookie cannot read data from your
            hard disk or read cookie files that may have been created from other sites. The
            Orkin.com Web site utilizes cookies as a means of providing personalization features
            to our visitors. For example, we utilize cookies to remember settings (zipcodes,
            accessibility settings, etc.) that you may have made at our Web site.</p>
        <p>
            You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser.
            Typically, by accessing the browser's help feature you can obtain information on
            how to prevent your browser from accepting all cookies or to notify you when a cookie
            is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our
            Web site and other web sites may be diminished, and some features may not work as
            intended.</p>
            <h3>How does Orkin.com protect my personal data?</h3>
        <p>
            Orkin, Inc. uses reasonable precautions to keep the information disclosed to us
            secure. We have implemented security policies, rules and technical measures to protect
            your personal data from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure or unauthorized
            modification. All our employees who have access to, and are associated with the
            processing of personal data, are obligated to respect the confidentiality of your
            personal data.</p>

            <h3>What other information does Orkin.com request?</h3>
        <p>
            We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting
            a survey, adding you to our mailing list or to have someone contact you for additional
            information by your request. Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will
            clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested.
            We maintain a strict "No Spam" policy that means we do not intend to sell,
            rent or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third- party, without your consent.</p>
        <p>
            In addition, Orkin, Inc. will not send you e-mail that you have not agreed to receive.
            If you are a member of our Mailing List, you will be contacted with announcements,
            news and new products or services. You have the option of "Unsubscribing"
            from our Mailing List at any time, thereby disabling any further such e-mail communication
            from being sent to you. If you wish to have specific communications with a member
            of the Orkin, Inc. staff, you will be required to provide specific information that
            will be routed to the appropriate contact within Orkin, Inc.
        </p>

            <h3>How does Orkin.com support the Childrens’ Online Privacy Protection Rule?</h3>
        <p>
            We observe appropriate national laws and regulations on children's privacy, including
            the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 in the United States.
            Orkin does not actively market to children, and we never knowingly ask a child under
            13 to divulge personal information. If a child under 13 has provided us with personal
            information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian may e-mail
            us, and we will remove the information and unsubscribe the child from any promotional
            contact opportunities.</p>
            <h3>Will Orkin, Inc. disclose the information collected to Third Parties?</h3>
        <p>
            Orkin, Inc. will disclose your personal information or any of its log file information
            when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such actions are necessary
            to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on Orkin,
                Inc.</li>
            <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of Orkin, Inc., or visitors of Orkin,
                Inc.</li>
            <li>Identify persons who may be violating the law, the legal notice or the rights of
                third parties.</li>
            <li>
            Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities.
        </li></ol>
        <p>
            Orkin, Inc. uses reasonable precautions to keep the information disclosed to us
            secure. Orkin, Inc. reserves the right to transfer information in connection with
            the sale of all or part of Orkin, Inc. capital stock or assets to any third party.
            Furthermore, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions
            of any third parties that receive the information. Orkin, Inc. also provides "links"
            to a wide variety of other Web sites on the Internet. We are not responsible for
            their Privacy Policies or how those web sites manage information about their users.
            We strongly urge you to check with those web sites to determine their privacy policy.</p>
        <p>
            Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on this page so that you are always
            aware of the information that we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances
            we disclose it.</p>
