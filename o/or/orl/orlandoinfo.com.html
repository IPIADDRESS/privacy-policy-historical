	      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name.</p>

<p>We collect information about users who register for programs on our site, fill out surveys, request visitor information, enter contests, communicate with us by e-mail, and make purchases on our site. We also track page views and usage patterns. We track e-mail open rates in order to monitor the effectiveness and relevance of our newsletter content.</p>

<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be combined with similar information obtained from other users to help improve our site and services (for example, to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive), and to further our mission of promoting Orlando as a tourist destination. Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners.</p>

<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on orlandoinfo.com to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service&nbsp;and privacy policy; services and products offered by orlandoinfo.com, and our partners; information about travel to Orlando and other topics we think you might find of interest. We reserve the right to share this information with our advertisers and business partners. We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies.</p>

<p>Personally Identifiable Information may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. We will use your information only as permitted by law.</p>

<p>Upon request, we send out free vacation information packages to postal addresses. You will receive only the information, which you requested when you provided us your postal address.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>A "cookie" is a small data file transferred by a Web site to your computer's hard drive. When you surf our site, make purchases, request or personalize information, or register yourself for certain services, a cookie may be placed on to your computer. By accepting the cookie(s), it does not give us access to your personal information, but we may use it to identify your computer. This information helps us in tracking user activity and our Web site's useability. There are 2 cookies, "session" cookies and "permanent" cookies.</p>

<p>"Session" cookies do not stay on your computer after you leave our Web site or close your browser. The information collected permits us to analyze traffic patterns on our site. This can enable us over time to provide a better experience on our site by improving content or personalization and making our site easier to use.</p>

<p>"Permanent" cookies are those that remain on your computer. They are used to facilitate shopping, personalization and registration services. For example, cookies can keep track of what you have selected to purchase as you continue to shop and allow you to enter your password only once on Web pages where a login is required. You can remove these "permanent" cookies at any time.</p>

<p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can usually refuse cookies or selectively accept certain cookies by adjusting the preferences in your browser. If you turn off cookies, there may be some features of our site that will not be available to you and some Web pages may not display properly. You can find information on popular browsers and how to adjust your cookie preferences at the following websites:</p>

<p><strong>Web beacons</strong></p>

<p>Some of our Web pages and HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters use Web beacons in conjunction with cookies to compile aggregate statistics about Web site usage. A Web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on a visitor's computer, such as a visitor's cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. You may render some Web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.</p>
