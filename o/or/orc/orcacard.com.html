<h3>Preface</h3>
	<p>The ORCA agencies conduct public business and the records related to
		their businesses are generally available for public review. Nevertheless,
		the agencies are committed, to the extent allowable by law, to protect
		and secure your personal information contained in ORCA records. This privacy
		commitment must be balanced with the rights of public access under Chapter <a href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/rcw/index.cfm?fuseaction=chapterdigest&amp;chapter=42.17">42.17
		RCW</a> (external link, Washington Public Disclosure Act) consistent with <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/mkcc/code/05-Title%202.pdf">KCC
		2.14.030</a> (549K PDF; scroll down to 2.14.030) and any other applicable
		federal, state, and local statute or regulation.</p>
	<p>This privacy notice does not apply to personnel files, job applications,
		court records, law enforcement investigation, regulatory investigation,
		assessor records, and recorded documents maintained by the Records, Elections,
		and Licensing Services division.</p>
	<h3>Information privacy </h3>
	<p>The agencies gather personal information when it is relevant and necessary
		to accomplish ORCA business. We only obtain this information through legal
		means. When the agencies collect personal information from you, we:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Tell you why we are collecting this personal information; </li>
		<li>Limit the amount of your personal information that we collect to that
			which is necessary for the stated purpose; </li>
		<li>Take reasonable steps to use your personal information to the stated
			purpose; </li>
		<li>Take steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete
			and current; </li>
		<li>Provide your personal information only to authorized employees and
			private contractors or public organizations on a need-to-know basis; </li>
		<li>Do not sell or make your personal information available to others
			without your consent except when legally required, needed to complete
			your transaction with the agencies, or in an extreme emergency that presents
			a threat of serious injury or loss of life; </li>
		<li>Retain personal information only as long as necessary to conduct ORCA
			business or only to the extent required by law; </li>
		<li>Dispose of personal information in a secure manner that prevents disclosure; </li>
		<li>Take organizational, technological, and physical measures to securely
			safeguard personal information. </li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Information privacy specific to the Internet </h3>

			such as visiting an agency office during normal business hours or, for
			some services, completing your business by mail or telephone. </li>
		<li>When the agencies collect personal information from children using
			the Internet, it complies with the federal <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm">Children's

		agencies, non-profit organizations and private businesses. When you link

		to the privacy notice of that Web site.</p>

		that the agencies maintain about you and ask the agencies to correct errors.</p>
