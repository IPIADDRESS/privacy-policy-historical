<p>Subject to applicable law, we retain information as necessary for the purposes set forth above. We may delete information from our systems, without notice to you, once we deem it is no longer necessary for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Cookies and Similar Technologies </u></strong></p>
<p>ListnPlay Ltd. uses cookies and similar technologies to help personalize your experience and to personalize the ads we serve you. A “persistent” cookie may be used to help save your settings and customizations across visits. Third parties through which we provide the Services and/or our business partners may be placing and reading cookies on your browsers, or using web beacons to collect information in the course of advertising being served on different websites.</p>

Functional cookies are instrumental to the functionality of the service and expire after 10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Performance cookies</strong> - When you visit a Site, we may also place a performance cookie on your device. Performance cookies differ from functional cookies as they can exist on the user’s device for an extended period of time until expired or until they are deleted. These cookies are used to store and remember a user’s preferences such as the preferred music service or to detect recurring visits to the Site/s.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Advertising cookies</strong> - When you visit our Site/s, we also places third-party advertising cookies on your device, which help our partners deliver or enable the delivery of advertising that is customized to your interests and to keeps track of how many ads users have seen.</p>
<p>Advertisers on mobile devices may use advertising (or ad) identifiers (non-permanent, non-personal device identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple's ID for advertising, or IDFA) to enable and optimize their advertising. You can reset these identifiers or indicate your preference that they should not be used for advertising purposes, as detailed below.</p>
<p><u>How to Adjust Your Preferences</u></p>
<p>Most Web browsers are initially configured to accept cookies, but you can change this setting so your browser either refuses all cookies or informs you when a cookie is being sent. In addition, you are free to delete any existing cookies at any time. We also provide a way for End Users to accept and change their cookie preferences directly on Feature.fm’s pages. Please note that some features of the Sites and/or Services may function improperly when cookies are disabled or removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By changing your device settings, you can prevent your device's ad identifier being used for interest-based advertising, or you can reset your device's ad identifier. Typically, you can find the ad identifier settings under “privacy” or “ads” in your device's settings, although settings may vary from device to device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adjusting your preferences as described in this section does not mean you will no longer receive advertisements, it only means the advertisement you do see will be less relevant to your interests.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>All use of third-party applications or services (including Third Party Services) is at your own risk and subject to such third party's privacy policies.</p>
