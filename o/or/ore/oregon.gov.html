<ol>

<li>The Internet Protocol (IP) address and domain name used (but not the e-mail address). The IP address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the Internet IP to respond to your browser request. &nbsp;<i>Example</i>: 122.125.36.42;</li> 
<li>The Domain domain name (DNS) assigned on the Internet to your IP Address (if there is one). &nbsp;<i>Example</i>: &nbsp;&nbsp;somename.com;</li> 
<li>The type of browser and operating system you used. &nbsp;Example: &nbsp;Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; Windows NT; IE4WDUS-1998101501);</li> 
<li>The date and time you visited this site;</li> 
<li>The web pages or services you accessed at this site; and</li> 
<li>The web site you visited prior to coming to this web site. (Note: this is included so that summary analysis can be done on how visitors get to your site, i.e., from a search engine, from a link on another site, etc.)</li> </ol>


<p>We do not track individual user navigation choices. We do, however, summarize 
  the information listed above to determine:</p>
<ul>
  <li>what organizations are our most frequent users (item 2 above) to better 
    target our content for the audience.</li>
  <li>what browsers are being used on our site to determine what techniques we 
    can use to develop pages that will work with different browsers (item 3 above). 
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li>how often our pages are being used (item 5 above). </li>
  <li>by the traffic from organization names such things as the search engines 
    that are good at directing people to the site (item 6 above)</li>
</ul>
<p>For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available 
  to all users, this site may monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized 
  attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. If security 
  monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, system personnel 
  may provide the results of such monitoring to appropriate officials. Except 
  for authorized law enforcement investigations no attempts are made to identify 
  individual users or their usage habits. Unauthorized attempts to upload information 
  or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable 
  under the state law and federal statutes including the Computer Fraud and Abuse 
  Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996.

<a name="public_disc"></a>
<p><b>Public Disclosure</b> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#INDEX"><font size="-1">(return to index)</font></a></p>
 
<p>All information collected at this site becomes a public 
  record unless an exemption in law exists. <a href="http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/192.html">ORS 
  Chapter 192</a> contains the Oregon Public Records 
  Law. and other program specific ORS's and OAR's.</p>

<p>In the State of Oregon, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that 
  the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed 
  by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's 
  right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy 
  of individuals. Both state and federal laws provide exceptions. We may request 
  personally identifiable information from you in order to provide requested services, 
  but such information is handled as it would be on an in-person visit to a governmental 
  office.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="personal_nondis"></a> 
<p><b>Personal Information 
  and Nondisclosure</b> <a href="#INDEX"><font size="-1">(return to index)</font></a></p>
<p>"Personal information" is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that individual, such as an individual's name, address and telephone number. Such personal information may be exempt from disclosure if disclosure would constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy under the circumstances. A domain name or Internet Protocol (IP) address is not considered personal information. Most information collected by state government is assumed to be open to the public unless specifically exempted. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/192.html">ORS Chapter 192</a> contains the Oregon Public Records Law. &nbsp;Under this law, individuals are permitted to request that public officials not disclose a public record that contains their home address and telephone number under certain circumstances. ORS 192.445 specifies how to request non-disclosure.</p>
<b><p>E-mail:</p>
</b><p>If you send us an electronic mail message with a question or comment that contains personal information, or fill out a form that e-mails us this information, we will only use the information needed to respond to your request. We may redirect your message to another government agency that is in a better position to answer your question.</p>
<p>The information collected is subject to the access and confidentiality provisions of the Oregon law including <a href="http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/192.html">ORS Chapter192</a>.</p>
 <b>
<p>Forms:</p>
</b> 
<p>Each electronic form that collects personal information on this site will have 
  a specific privacy statement or a link to the privacy statement that explains 
  the conditions (if any) under which information may be shared with other parties.

<p><b>Requesting Personal Information Inspection</b> 
  <a href="#INDEX"><font size="-1">(return to index)</font></a></p>

<p>You have the right to review information collected about you by this site. Contact the agency that provides the service you requested.</p>

<a name="secure"></a> 
  <b>Secure Transmission</b> 
  <a href="#INDEX"><font size="-1">(return to index)</font></a><p></p>
 
<p>For secured-data transmission, this site uses the industry standard encryption 
  software, Secure Socket Layer (SSL). The URL in your browser will change to 
  "HTTPS" instead of "HTTP" when this security feature is invoked. Your browser 
  may also display a lock or key symbol on its task bar to indicate invoked secure 
  transmission. If these indicators are not present, any information is susceptible 
  to interception by other parties. Most Internet e-mail communication will not 
  be secure. If you are communicating sensitive information, you might want to 
  consider sending it in by postal mail. </p>


<a name="cookies"></a>

<p><b>Cookies</b> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#INDEX"><font size="-1">(return to index)</font></a></p>
<p>A cookie file is a small text file created by a web site on your computer hard drive that contains unique information the site can use to track such things as passwords, lists of pages you've visited, the date when you last looked at a specific page or to identify your session at a particular web site. A cookie is often used in commercial sites to identify the items selected for a specific shopping cart application. If cookies are used on the web site their use will be clearly marked. While most browsers have an option that allows you to control the use of cookies, their use might provide some features that can not be used if cookies are turned off. Each application start page where cookies are used will have a specific statement that explains the use of the cookies, what information is being stored and whether the information is deleted or retained for future use when you complete your session.</p>
