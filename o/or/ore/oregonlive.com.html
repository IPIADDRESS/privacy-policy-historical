<b></b><h2><b></b><center><b>Oregon Live PRIVACY POLICY</b></center></h2><p></p><p>
The <b>Oregon Live</b> Web site is maintained by <b>Oregon Live, 815 SW Second Avenue, Suite 200, Portland, OR  97204.</b>  We can be reached  by e-mail at <a href="mailto:otalkback@oregonlive.com">otalkback@oregonlive.com.</a>.</p><p>

<b>HOW Oregon Live USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU: </b> This site does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals.  A user's personally identifiable information may be used by <b>Oregon Live</b> and its affiliates for editorial purposes.  Or if you choose to purchase items through our commerce site, we will forward your information to third parties for credit card processing and order fulfillment.  <b>Oregon Live</b> may also use such information for marketing and promotional purposes. We may share your personally identifiable information with other companies with which it conducts business.  For example, if you enter our contests, make a purchase or use our e-mail services, we sometimes rely on outside companies to provide these services to you. In such cases, we need to provide your personally identifiable information to them. We also sometimes provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs. While <b>Oregon Live</b> will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it was provided, <b>Oregon Live</b> does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of any third parties.</p><p>

<b>Except for purposes outlined above, we do not provide, sell or lease your personally identifiable information to any third parties, unless otherwise stated at the time of collection.

We also collect anonymous, aggregated data and provide it to our advertisers and other companies that we do business with for market research and statistical purposes.  For example, we might report to our advertisers that a certain percentage of users are between the ages of 30-35.</p><p>

Finally, you should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information  (e.g., first and last name, address, e-mail address, etc) on the forums or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.</p><p>

<b>COOKIES:</b> <b>Oregon Live</b> may place a "cookie" in the browser files of <b>Oregon Live</b> user's computer.  The cookie may contain personally identifiable information.

Additionally, anonymous aggregated data is sometimes provided to other companies which we do business with, for statistical and market research purposes as described above.  Finally, you should be aware that if your child voluntarily discloses his name,
