<b>HOW Oregon Live USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU: </b> This site does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals.

We also sometimes provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs. While <b>Oregon Live</b> will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it was provided, <b>Oregon Live</b> does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of any third parties.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">

<b>Except for purposes outlined above, we do not provide, sell or lease your personally identifiable information to any third parties, unless otherwise stated at the time of collection.

Finally, you should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information  (e.g., first and last name, address, e-mail address, etc) on the forums or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">
