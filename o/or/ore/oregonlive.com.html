            <p>This Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement (“Privacy Policy”) explains how Advance Local, and its Local
                Media Groups, process <a href="#personal_information">Personal Information</a> in relation to the
                <a href="#service">Service</a>. This Privacy Policy does not
                apply to websites, apps, destinations, or other offerings that we do not own or control, even if they
                are linked to from the Service. All capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy that are not otherwise
                defined have the meanings set forth in the <a href="#glossary">Glossary</a></p>
            <p>You can access this Privacy Policy any time in the footer of the Service's home page, via the menu
                button/hamburger icon or on the Service description screen, or as otherwise indicated depending on the
                Service you are using. By purchasing a <a href="#product">Product</a>, registering for any aspect of the
                Service, or otherwise
                accessing, visiting or using the Service, you consent and agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy
                Policy. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, you should not access,
                visit and/or use the Service, or request or receive a Product. We advise that you print or retain a
                digital copy of this Privacy Policy for future reference.</p>
            <p>In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, please also review our <a href="/user-agreement">User
                    Agreeement</a> and any other terms
                and conditions that may be posted elsewhere in the Service or otherwise communicated to our users,
                because the <a href="/user-agreement">User Agreeement</a> and all such terms and conditions are also
                part of the <a href="#agreement">Agreement</a> between you
                and us.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time, so check back often. So that you are aware changes
                have been made, we will adjust the “Last Revised” date at the beginning of this document. If we make a
                material change to this Privacy Policy, we will also post on the Service a prominent notice that a
                change was made. Continued access, visitation and/or use of the Service by you, or continued receipt of
                a Product, will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy. </p>

                        or attend a conference or event, you may be provided, or required to choose, a password and/or

                        Personal Information such as your age, gender, and preferences may also be requested. In

                        mail, social media interaction or messaging (e.g., email, SMS, MMS, or similar technologies). We
                        also may acquire Personal Information that you provide about other people, for example, when you

                    <p>Your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" (DNT) signal to
                        websites and online services that you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants
                        as to what DNT means in this context, and some browsers automatically apply DNT signals by
                        default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitors’ choice as to whether they wish to
                        receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result, like many websites and online
                        services, we do not alter our practices when the Service receives a DNT signal from a visitor's
                        browser. As discussed below, you may opt out of the use of your Personal Information for online
                        behavioral advertising by third parties at any time. To find out more about DNT, please visit

                        Service for purposes of “online behavioral advertising” (OBA). OBA allows the serving of
                        advertisements tailored to perceived interests inferred by your browsing on the Service and on
                        other sites, applications, destinations, and services, using the same or a different Device. To
                        enable OBA, we (and our Service Providers on our behalf), as well as Third Party Businesses,
                        independently use Tracking Technologies to collect certain information, some of which may be
                        deemed Personal Information, including for example the make, model, settings, specifications
                        (e.g., CPU speed, connection speed, browser type, operating system, device identifier, online
                        identifier) and geographic location of your Device, as well as date/time stamp, IP address,
                        pages visited, time of visits, Content viewed, ads viewed, the site(s), application(s),
                        destination(s), and/or service(s) you arrived from, and other clickstream data. The use of
                        Tracking Technologies by Third Party Businesses is subject to their own privacy policies, not
                        this Privacy Policy, and we have no responsibility or liability in connection therewith.</p>
