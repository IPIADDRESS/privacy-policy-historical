									<p>At O'Reilly Auto Parts maintaining your privacy is a top priority.

									<p>The following policy overviews our commitment to protecting our customers privacy and is broken down into the following areas:  Personal Information, Customer Rights, and Security.</p>
									<p><b><u>Personal Information</u></b></p>
									<p><b>What is collected?</b> On some O'Reilly web pages, you can order products or services, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are name, contact and billing information, transaction, and credit card information.</p>
								    <p>In order to tailor our website to continuously improve our products and services, we may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products, and contact preferences.</p>
								    <p><b>How is it used?</b>O'Reilly uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, to update you on service and benefits, and to personalize our web sites for you. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes.</p>
								    <p>Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide when you register your ownership of O'Reilly products.</p>
								    <p><b>Who do we share it with?</b> O'Reilly will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to any others. Unless we have your direct permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide online with other O'Reilly entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described above. Such O'Reilly entities and/or business partners, including those in the United States and/or any other countries, are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data and are bound by the appropriate confidentiality agreements.</p>
