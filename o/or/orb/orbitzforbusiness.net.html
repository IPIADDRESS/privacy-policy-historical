The Orbitz for Business website is accessible only to individuals whose organizations have elected to have us offer the Orbitz for Business services to them.  The Site is not intended for, nor is it accessible to, the general public.</p>

<p>BY SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US, AND/OR BY USING OUR SITE OR PERMITTING US ACCESS TO YOUR THIRD PARTY ACCOUNTS, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY COLLECT, USE AND DISCLOSE SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND AS PERMITTED OR REQUIRED BY LAW.  If you do not agree with these terms, do not provide any personal information to us. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, or if you choose not to provide us with any required personal information, we may not be able to provide you with products or services offered on our Site.</p>

<a name="p1"><h3> What personal information we collect </h3></a>
<blockquote>
<p>When you first register as a member, we require that you provide us with limited contact information, including your name, email address, and organization's name.  If you consented to have your organization share your personal travel information with us, we will match the limited information you provide with the travel profile you may have provided your organization.  If you did not give consent directly to your organization, then at the time you register we may ask for your consent to obtain from your organization your full travel profile.  Included in that profile will be more detailed personal information that you provided to your organization, such as your address, frequent flyer numbers, and credit card numbers for travel bookings.  Your consent for your organization to share your travel profile with us may be necessary for you to become a member of this Site.  At the time your register, you will also need to choose a password, which will be required to gain access our Site. We might also request your home zip code.</p>
<p>If you book Products or Services for other travelers using your Member ID and password, or if you provide us with contact information of a third party for OrbitzTLC Alerts, you must make sure that you have the right to do so. By providing the personal information of another traveler, you represent that you have all necessary authority and/or have obtained all necessary consents from such person to enable us to collect, use and disclose his or her personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>During your use of our Site, we may from time to time ask you to provide other information, for example, gender, activities and lifestyle preferences, preferred destinations, seat selection or meal request preferences, details about your participation in loyalty or awards programs and applicable membership numbers, or other ticketing options.  From time to time, we may also invite you to participate in an optional survey or a focus group.  When you book products or services, such as booking a flight or hotel, we will require that you provide payment or other necessary information. This includes, for example, billing information, driver information, or other information as required by a third party product or service provider (hotel or airline, for example).  </p>
<p>We may also offer you the option of permitting us access to your third party accounts, such as your TripIt account. We may view and use any information stored in such third party accounts in accordance with this policy.</p>
<p>Minors (as defined under the laws of their jurisdiction or residence) are not eligible to register for, use, or book the products or services available on our Site.  Since this Site is only accessible to corporate organizations, we do not believe we are collecting information from minors, nor do we knowingly collect information from any minor, and will not use information if we discover that it has been provided by a minor.</p>
