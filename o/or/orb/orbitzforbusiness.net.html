<p></p><ul>
<li>If required to comply with a subpoena or warrant issued or an order made by a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information or to comply with the rules of a court relating to the production of records;</li>

It may also contain other information so that you do not need to re-enter it each time you Book a Product or Service. For example, My Account may contain your billing information unless you tell us not to store it. It may also contain your preferences for seat selection or special meals, details about your participation in loyalty or awards programs and applicable membership numbers, passport number, visa number(s) and other travel preferences. We also keep in My Account all other information that your organization has provided or that you have elected to provide us, such as gender, travel loyalty numbers, travel special requests, Personal Information of your administrative assistant (if applicable) and emergency contacts.  My Travel Arrangers contains a list of individuals within your organization who have the ability to Book Products and Services on your behalf. </p><p>

<p><strong><a name="RS">Retention and Storage</a></strong></p>
<p>We will retain your Personal Information in our databases in accordance with our Records Management Policy and applicable laws. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later. For example, we may need or be required to retain information to allow you to obtain credit for a trip you Booked but had to cancel. We may also need to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or if we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.</p>

<p>Orbitz for Business employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of Personal Information. When Personal Information is sent to our service providers, we require in our contracts with them that they protect all Personal Information in a manner consistent with the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to contact Orbitz for Business through our Site, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be secure. Orbitz for Business assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web. However, if you provide your credit card information on our Site's credit card forms or if you choose to search for Products and Services, through the Orbitz for Business mobile applications, that are located near you and we collect your geo-location, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>In communicating with you, we may send e-mail as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that most Members and Guests cannot readily process encrypted e-mail.
