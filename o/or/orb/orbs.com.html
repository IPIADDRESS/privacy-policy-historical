      </p><p>
        Orbs.com is committed to protecting your personal information ("Personal Data"). 
        This privacy policy details what information Orbs.com collects, how it's 
        collected and what restrictions there are on sharing it.

      <h3>What Personal Information We Collect</h3>
      
      <p>
        When you sign up for a Orbs.com account, we collect personal information about 
        you including your name and e-mail address. We use such information to provide 
        the service you requested, to monitor internal usage of our Site, and to 
        contact you from time to time about us, our Site, and our products and services.
      
      </p><p>
        Please note that we are not responsible for any personal information that you 
        voluntarily provide through edits and submissions on any Orbs.com Site.  This 
        includes your user name and your user profile information if you've opted to 
        make it public.
      
      </p><p>
        If you send a communication to Orbs.com, we may hold onto that communication so

      <h3>What Information is Automatically Collected</h3>
      
      <p>
        When you visit our Site, some information is also automatically collected. For 
        example, your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's

      <h3>Restrictions on Sharing Personal Information</h3>
      
      <p>
        We do not sell, rent or share personal information with third parties without 
        your prior consent except in these limited circumstances:
      
      </p><p>
        <b>Aggregated Data</b> - We may from time to time, combine data from a group of users 
        but remove all personal identifying information about individual users. This 
        aggregate information helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we 
        can better consider new services and improve existing services to customers.  
        We may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties outside of 
        Orbs.com with certain restrictions.
      
      </p><p>
        <b>Service Providers</b> - We may enter into a relationship with a third party 
        who provides services to us (e.g. data storage services, data management).  In 
        those circumstances, we disclose information about you that is necessary for 
        such service providers to perform those services, but only if such service 
        providers agree not to disclose your information except as necessary to perform 
        their services.
      
      </p><p>
  
        <b>Other Circumstances</b> - Notwithstanding anything in this privacy policy to 
        the contrary, we reserve the right, unless limited by applicable law, to share 
        any information we have collected about you or that you have submitted: (1) in 
        response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal processes, or to establish, 
        protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; (2) if we 
        believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action 
        regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats 
        to the safety of any person or property; (3) if we believe it is necessary to 
        investigate, prevent, or take action regarding situations that involve 
        significant abuse of our website infrastructure or the Internet in general 
        (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to 
        compromise the security of information); (4) to our parent company, 
        subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us 
        (in which case we will require such entities to honor this privacy policy); and 
        (5) if we are acquired by or merged with another entity.
