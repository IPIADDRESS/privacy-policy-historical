      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Orbit.net is aware and understands that as an Internet user you are concerned about your personal privacy and the manner in which your personal information is used by the web sites that you visit.  This page has been established to address this concern by explaining Orbit.net’s Privacy Policy.  Orbit.net’s Privacy Policy describes the manner in which Orbit.net collects and uses information about you.  Please note that by accessing and using Orbit.net you agree to the following terms.  Please note that this policy applies only to Orbit.net and other web sites that carry the Orbit brand, and not to other companies’ or organizations’ web sites to which we link now and/or in the future.<br>
      <br>
      Our primary goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a customized experience while you are using our services.   The information we collect is restricted to that which is needed in order for us to  enhance the services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to make your experience easier, quicker and more secure.<br>
      <br>
      In the course of serving our customers, Orbit.net acquires, stores and transmits customer communications and information that customers may regard as private and/or sensitive.  Our customers provide some of this information – such as the customer’s name, address, telephone number, and credit card data – to Orbit.net in order to make a purchase or obtain services.  Orbit.net also creates and maintains other information – such as the customer’s account status, purchases, and customer logs – in the normal course of business.<br>
      <br>
      Certain information about you is automatically tracked while visiting our site.  This information is based upon your behavior on our site and is used for internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior so that we may better understand and serve our users.<br>
      <br>
      We may also use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, new services and promotions.  By accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy you expressly agree to receive this information.<br>
      <br>
      Our business changes constantly.  This Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use may change as well so we recommend you check our web site periodically for updates and changes.<br>
      <br>
      Cookies<br>
      As used herein, the term “cookie” refers to a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you.  Most (but not all) cookies are “session cookies,” meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session.  In any case, a cookie cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.<br>
      <br>
      We use cookies on certain pages of our site.  We may also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie.  Among the reasons we use cookies is the fact that cookies allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session.<br>
      <br>
      While Orbit.net uses cookies to track your visit to Orbit.net and our web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, this information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous unless you have agreed otherwise and provided Orbit.net with personal information.<br>
      <br>
      Children<br>
      Orbit.net does not sell products for purchase by children.  Any children’s products we sell are for purchase by adults.  If you are under the age of 18, you can only make purchases on Orbit.net in conjunction with your parent or guardian.  Furthermore, if you are under the age of 13, we ask that you not submit any personal information to Orbit.net.<br>
      <br>
      Disclosure<br>
      We release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law, enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements, or protect rights, property, or safety of Orbit.net, our users, or others.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<br>
      <br>
      Security<br>
      In our efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, Orbit.net uses security systems which exceed the currently accepted industry standards, including  firewalls,  SSL (Secure Socket Layers) and a range of other systems and security features.<br>
