<p>If you choose to contact Orbitz through the Site, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be secure.

However, should you choose to pay by credit card when making a booking, reservation or purchase on the Site, your card details are encrypted for the transaction.</p>
