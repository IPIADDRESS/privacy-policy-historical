				  <i>In this document, 'OrgSync.com' and 'OrgSync' are products owned by OrgSync, Inc. and may be used synonymously with 'OrgSync, Inc.' where appropriate.</i>
  <br><br>
  
  OrgSync knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate 
  your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy 
  policy. <strong>By visiting OrgSync.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.</strong> 
  <br><br>
  
  
  <strong>What Personal Information About Customers Does OrgSync Gather?</strong><br><br>
  The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your 
  experience at OrgSync.com. Here are the types of information we gather. 
  <ol>
      <li><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> We receive and store any information you enter on our 
          Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, 
          but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the 
          information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing 
          future visits for you, improving our services, and communicating with you. </li>
      <li><strong>Automatic Information:</strong> We receive and store certain types of information whenever 
          you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "session variables," and we 
          obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses OrgSync.com.  Unlike "cookies,"
          "session variables" reside on our server and not on your computer.</li>
      <li><strong>E-mail Communications:</strong> We store all e-mail correspondences between you and OrgSync.com in 
          order to improve your future experiences.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <strong>Does OrgSync Share the Information It Receives?</strong><br><br>
  Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business 
  of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries 
  OrgSync, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at 
  least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. 
  <ol>
      <li><strong>Agents:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. 
          Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail and processing credit card payments. They 
          have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it 
          for other purposes. </li>
      <li><strong>Promotional Offers:</strong> Sometimes we may send offers to selected groups of OrgSync.com customers 
          on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and 
          address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer Communication 
          Preferences. </li>
      <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, 
          subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of 
          the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing 
          Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely 
          event that OrgSync, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer 
          information will of course be one of the transferred assets. </li>
      <li><strong>Protection of OrgSync and Others:</strong> We release account and other personal information when 
          we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our 
          <a href="/master_subscription_agreement">Master Subscription Agreement</a>
          and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of OrgSync, our users, or 
          others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud 
          protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, 
          sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for 
          commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.</li>
      <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information 
          about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share 
          the information. </li>
      <li><strong>As part of our service:</strong> OrgSync is a form of social network.  As such, the information 
          you supply may be used to help connect you with other similar members.  Additionally, 
          administrators of any organization you join have the option of making several of the components 
          of your OrgSync enabled organization publicly accessible.  Please check with your organization's 
          administrators before you register if you are concerned that your activities within the club 
          may be made public.</li>
					<li><strong>Facebook Connect:</strong> OrgSync does not send or share information with Facebook in any manner. Facebook is aware when someone logs in to OrgSync through Facebook Connect, but none of that student's information is sent from OrgSync to Facebook.
					</li>
  </ol>
  
  <strong>How Secure Is Information About Me? </strong>
  <ol>
      <li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer 
          (SSL) software and randomized hashing.</li>
      <li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. 
          Be sure to sign off and close the browser when you are finished using the site. </li>
  </ol>
  
  <strong>Which Information Can I Access?</strong><br><br>
      OrgSync gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with 
      OrgSync.com for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.
  <br><br><br>
  
  <strong>What Choices Do I Have? </strong>
  <ol>
      <li>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be 
          needed to take advantage of some or any of OrgSync.com's features.</li>
      <li>You can add, remove or update certain personal information on appropriate pages. </li>
      <li>Regarding group services, such as OrgSync.com, if you do not want to allow others to see your 
          e-mail address, you have the option to hide it.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <strong>Children</strong><br><br>
      OrgSync.com does not sell products or services for purchase by children. When products are suitable for use
      by children, they are intended as products and services for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, 
      you may use OrgSync.com only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 
  <br><br>
  
  <strong>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</strong><br><br>
      If you choose to visit OrgSync.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this 
      Notice and our <a href="/master_subscription_agreement">Master Subscription Agreement</a>.  If you have any concern about privacy at OrgSync.com, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. 
  <br><br>
  
  Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the
  <a href="/master_subscription_agreement">Master Subscription Agreement</a>
  will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not 
  to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, 
  our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand 
  behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to 
  make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of 
  affected customers.
