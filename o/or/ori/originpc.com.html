              <p>ORIGIN PC knows that you care  how your information is used, and we appreciate your trust that we will use it  carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. <strong>By  visiting us, you are accepting the privacy policy described below. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>1. What Personal Information  Do We Collect? </strong> </p>
              <ul class="bullet">
                <li><strong>Information You Provide. </strong>We receive and store information you enter. For  example, when you search for or buy a product or service, or when you supply  information such as your address, phone number or credit card. You can choose  not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take  advantage of some of our features. We use the information that you provide for  such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for  you, improving our website, and communicating with you.</li>
                <li><strong>Cookies. </strong>Like  many websites, we use "cookies". Cookies are small programs that we  transfer to your hard drive that allow us to recognize you and to provide you  with a customized shopping experience. If you do not want us to use cookies,  you can easily disable them by going to the toolbar of your web browser, and  clicking on the “help” button. Follow the instructions that will prevent the  browser from accepting cookies, or set the browser to inform you when you  receive a new cookie. In addition, you may visit this and other websites  anonymously through the use of utilities provided by other private companies.</li>
                <li><strong>Other Information: </strong>Every computer has an IP (Internet Protocol) address. IP addresses of computers  used to visit this site are noted.</li>
                <li><strong>Information from Other Sources</strong>. We might receive information about you from other  sources and add it to our account information. This may include updated  delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we  can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more  easily. </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>2. How Do We Use Your  Information? </strong> </p>
              <ul class="bullet">
                <li><strong>Customized Shopping. </strong>We use your information to better serve you by  providing a customized shopping experience. As noted above, you may visit and  shop anonymously without logging in.</li>
                <li>                <strong>Agents. </strong>We  employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples include delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, and  processing credit card payments. They have access to personal information  needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</li>
                <li>                <strong>Special Offers</strong>.  We may send you special offers from time to time, unless you choose to  “opt-out” of receiving such offers.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>                <strong>Law Enforcement. </strong>If we receive a lawful court order to release account or other personal  information then we will comply with the law. We will also release information  when necessary to protect the life, safety or property of others. This includes  exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud  protection and credit risk reduction. </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>3. How Do We Protect the  Security of Your Information? </strong> </p>
              <ul class="bullet">
                <li> We work to protect the security of your information  during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which  encrypts information you input. </li>
                <li> We use encryption to protect your information  contained in our customer list. </li>
                <li> We use a firewall to protect against unlawful  intrusion. </li>
                <li> We limit access to your information on a “need to  know” basis. </li>
                <li> We reveal only the last five digits of your credit  card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit  card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. </li>
                <li> It is important for you to protect against  unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off  when finished using a shared computer. </li>
                <li> No system can guarantee absolute security, just as the  finest lock can not guarantee physical security. However, we take every  reasonable precaution to assure that your data is secure. </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>4. Your Choice: Opt-in or  Opt-out. </strong> </p>
              <p>              It is your choice whether to  receive emails or special offers from us.</p>
              <p>                <strong>5. Children </strong> </p>
              <p>              We do  not sell products or services to children. If you are under 18, you may use  this site only with involvement of a parent or guardian.</p>
              <p>                <strong>6. Other Websites </strong> </p>
              <p>              Various  Web sites may be linked to from this site. If you link to another site, your  privacy depends on the policy of that site. We strongly urge you to check their  privacy policy. Not all sites guarantee that they will not share your  personally identifiable information with others. You may also wish to consult  privacy guidelines such as those recommended by the Online Privacy Alliance  (www.privacyalliance.org).</p>
