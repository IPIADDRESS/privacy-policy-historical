			<p></p><p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND TO ALL THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT AND OUR WEBSITE TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, EXIT THIS PAGE AND DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE.</p>

<h4>1. Changes to Privacy Statement</h4>

<p>We may change this Privacy Statement at any time by posting them in the “Privacy Statement” section. The revised Privacy Statement is effective immediately when posted on the Website. It is the responsibility of each User to check the Privacy Statement occasionally to learn of any change to this Privacy Statement. Your continued use of the Website after the effectiveness of such revisions will constitute your acknowledgment and acceptance of the terms of the revised Privacy Statement.</p>

<h4>2. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information</h4>

<p>We collect two types of information about our Website Users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.<br>
Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific End User. When you engage in certain activities on the Website, such as subscribing to our newsletters, posting a comment, filling out our contact or hire us form, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address, email address…. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.</p>

<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, our product offerings, and to tailor your experience to the best. For example, if you send an email or post a comment we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your comment in our marketing materials or on our Website. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.</p>

<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific End User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are using and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies.</p>

<p>We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to administer the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.</p>

<h4>3. Release of Personally Identifiable Information</h4>

<p>We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided below:</p>

<p>We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of Others. We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or a court order; enforce or apply this Privacy Statement, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, its Users or others.</p>

<h4>4. Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h4>

<p>We use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our Users to administer our Website and constantly improve its quality. Please note that this is not Personally Identifiable Information, only general summaries of the activities of our Users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned and used by us.</p>

<h4>5. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</h4>

<p>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although it may be required to engage in a certain activity on the Website.</p>

<p>As a condition of subscribing to our newsletter, we will send you Administrative and Newsletters emails. We will send you information regarding your account activity as well as updates about our resources. You cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. “Administrative Emails” relate to a User’s activity on the Website, and include emails regarding a particular User’s account, requests or inquiries. In contrast to Administrative Emails, however, you do have a choice with respect to Newsletters Emails. Newsletters Emails advertise our resources and services. If you do not want to receive Newsletters Emails from us, you may elect to opt-out of receiving Newsletters Emails at any time after registering by e-mailing us at info [@] originalmockups [dot] com, or by hitting the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of any of our e-mails. When contacting us, please indicate your name, address, email address, and what Newsletters Emails you do not want to receive.</p>

<h4>6. Privacy Statement of Third Party Websites</h4>

<p>This Privacy Statement only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other websites that may be accessible through this Website have their own privacy statement and data collection, use and disclosure practices. If you link to any such website, we urge you review the website’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.</p>

<h4>7. Miscellaneous Privacy Issues</h4>

<p>Public Areas. We provide a commenting system areas on our Website where you can publicly post a comment. This information may be accessible by other users and may appear on other websites or web searches, and therefore this information could be read, collected, and used by others. No e-mail address is ever published when you login or post as a guest, however if you include your e-mail address in the comment itself you may receive unsolicited messages. We have no control over who reads your postings or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so please use caution when posting any personal information.</p>

<h4>8. Contacting Us</h4>

<p>We’d like to stay connected and want to hear from you!</p>
