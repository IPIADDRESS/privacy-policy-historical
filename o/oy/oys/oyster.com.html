                    <p>A cookie is a small piece of data that a web server places on a user's computer. Oyster employs the use of cookies and web beacons to ensure that you do not see the same ad repeatedly, to track marketing promotions, to estimate and report audience size and traffic, and to customize and personalize your experience at Oyster.com.</p><p>Furthermore, Oyster may, from time to time, use outside media companies to display advertisements on our site. These ads may contain cookies and web beacons, which are collected and tracked by the outside media company. Oyster has no access to or control over these cookies.</p><p>Most web browsers provide users the ability to limit the use of cookies and web beacons by allowing users to adjust privacy settings. If a user has their cookies disabled, Oyster will still be accessible, but some sections of the Web site will not perform as well as they normally would with cookies enabled.</p><p><i>Links to Other Web Sites</i></p><p>Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of STM. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements.

                        <h3>Site Registration, Email Subscriptions, Email Communications and Newsletters</h3>
                    <p>Oyster's registration form may require users to provide basic contact and demographic information. We use or may use your contact information (such as your email address) from the registration form to send you newsletters and occasional information about our services and partners, inform you if you are the potential winner of a contest or promotion, personalize your experience with Oyster, or investigate cases of suspected fraud or abuse. You may opt-out of receiving future communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link in an email from Oyster. In order to customize your experience with our email newsletters, we receive a confirmation when you open email from Oyster if your computer supports such capabilities. Clicking on a link in an Oyster newsletter is also tracked on a per user basis to allow us to present content which closely matches your interests. Demographic and profile data (such as state, zip code, age, or gender) is used to customize your experience at our site or in our email newsletters, showing you content and advertising that  best suits your needs. This information is shared with advertisers and other third parties on an aggregate or anonymized basis only. Personal information about individual users is never shared with advertisers.</p><p>If, in the future, you enter Oyster via a reward or incentive program, Oyster may share your email address with the program through which you entered Oyster to ensure you are credited with your incentive.</p><p>You may also register for Oyster and/or specific Oyster newsletters at Web sites operated by third parties. These third parties may share contact, demographic or profile data that you voluntarily provide during the registration process with Oyster. You also may provide personal information to third parties when you register at a third party Web site and specifically request that your information be forwarded to us so that we can send you information about our product and service offerings. Oyster does or may in the future use this information in the same manner as information collected directly by Oyster. This Privacy Policy does not bind sites that collect information on behalf of Oyster, and Oyster is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.</p><p>To better serve you, we may also store information you present to us via email or telephone communications with Oyster's Customer Service Department. This information is or may be used in the same manner as information directly collected using Oyster's registration form. We may also use information you provide us via email or telephone to pursue the matter for which you contacted us. Oyster also may obtain information from you in our online forums. This information may not be disclosed except as consistent with Oyster’s <a href="/about/terms/">Terms of Use</a>.</p><p>In order to better communicate with registered users about their registration status, Oyster may acquire information about users from third-party sources, including but not limited to a user’s mailing address. The information collected will be shared with third parties on an aggregate basis only, if at all.</p>

                        <h3>Display of Advertising/Your Choices</h3>
                    <p><i>Data collected to serve you with relevant advertising</i></p><p>Oyster and its affiliated Web sites are committed to providing you with relevant content and information across our sites. To do this, we may collect information about your travel-related searches, such as whether you are looking for hotels, and use this information to serve you with ads on our sites or elsewhere online that match your apparent interests. So, for example, if you search for a hotel room in Florida on Oyster.com, you may see an ad for a Florida travel package on Oyster.com or on another Web site you visit.</p><p>We do not share your personal information (such as email addresses) with unaffiliated third parties so they can serve you with advertisements. You can choose not to receive relevant online advertising on other Web sites based on your travel-related searches on Oyster.com by clicking <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>.</p><p>Many of the advertisements you see on the Oyster and STM family of sites are served by Oyster.com or its service providers. However, we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/privacy.html#cook">cookies and other technologies</a>. These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites, and (2) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different Web sites on the Internet. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our sites and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.</p><p>Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Some of these companies are members of the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative</a>, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. To learn more, please click <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>.</p><p><i>Data collected by companies that operate cookie-based exchanges to serve you with relevant advertising.</i></p><p>Like other companies operating online, Oyster participates in cookie-based exchanges where anonymous information is collected about your browsing behavior through cookies and other technologies and segmented into different topics of interest (such as travel). These topics of interest are then shared with third parties, including advertisers and ad networks, so they can tailor advertisements to your apparent interests. We do not share personal information (such as your email address) with these companies and we do not permit these companies to collect any such information about you on our site. Please click <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bluekai.com/consumers.php#optout">here</a> to learn more about cookie-based exchanges, including how to access information about the topics of interest associated with cookies on your computer and how to decline participation in these programs.</p>

                    <p><b>Automatic Information.</b> We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit Oyster. For example, we will collect your IP address, and information relating to your Web browser software and referring Web site. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as trips viewed. One of our goals in collecting this information is to help customize your user experience. We do not use this information to identify you.</p><p><b>Cookies and Other Web Technologies.</b> When you visit Oyster, we may assign your computer a "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file). You can always choose not to receive a cookie file by enabling your Web browser to refuse cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies from Oyster, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered by Oyster.</p><p><b>Information Collected Through Web Analytics.</b> Oyster uses a Web analytics company to track and generate reports on visitor use of our site. We use the Web analytics company to analyze visitor activity so that we may better understand how visitors make use of Oyster, and so that we may better tailor content to meet our visitors' needs. This data may include anonymized, individual visitor click behavior. No personally identifiable information is obtained or shared with the Web analytics company. Although our Web analytics company logs the information coming from Oyster on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used.</p>
