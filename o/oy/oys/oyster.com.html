                <p>Oyster's registration form may require users to provide basic contact and demographic information. We use or may use your contact information (such as your email address) from the registration form to send you newsletters and occasional information about our services and partners, inform you if you are the potential winner of a contest or promotion, personalize your experience with Oyster, or investigate cases of suspected fraud or abuse. You may opt-out of receiving future communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link in an email from Oyster.

                <h2>Display of Advertising/Your Choices</h2>

                <p><i>Data collected to serve you with relevant advertising</i></p><p>Oyster and its affiliated Web sites are committed to providing you with relevant content and information across our sites. To do this, we may collect information about your travel-related searches, such as whether you are looking for hotels, and use this information to serve you with ads on our sites or elsewhere online that match your apparent interests. So, for example, if you search for a hotel room in Florida on Oyster.com, you may see an ad for a Florida travel package on Oyster.com or on another Web site you visit.</p><p>We do not share your personal information (such as email addresses) with unaffiliated third parties so they can serve you with advertisements. You can choose not to receive relevant online advertising on other Web sites based on your travel-related searches on Oyster.com by clicking <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>.</p><p>Many of the advertisements you see on the Oyster and STM family of sites are served by Oyster.com or its service providers. However, we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/privacy.html#cook">cookies and other technologies</a>. These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites, and (2) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different Web sites on the Internet. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our sites and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.</p><p>Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Some of these companies are members of the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative</a>, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. To learn more, please click <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>.</p><p><i>Data collected by companies that operate cookie-based exchanges to serve you with relevant advertising.</i></p><p>Like other companies operating online, Oyster participates in cookie-based exchanges where anonymous information is collected about your browsing behavior through cookies and other technologies and segmented into different topics of interest (such as travel). These topics of interest are then shared with third parties, including advertisers and ad networks, so they can tailor advertisements to your apparent interests. We do not share personal information (such as your email address) with these companies and we do not permit these companies to collect any such information about you on our site. Please click <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bluekai.com/consumers.php#optout">here</a> to learn more about cookie-based exchanges, including how to access information about the topics of interest associated with cookies on your computer and how to decline participation in these programs.</p>
