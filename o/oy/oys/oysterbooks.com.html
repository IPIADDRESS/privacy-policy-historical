    <p><strong>Hi, and welcome to Oyster’s Privacy Policy.</strong> To provide you with the best possible service, including personalized book recommendations and social features, Oyster needs to collect some information about you. In the following paragraphs, we’ll explain our policy regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your information. We’ll also describe what types of data we gather, what we do with it, and how you can manage and control its use (as pertains to your personal information). As we update and grow our services, this Privacy Policy may change. We will notify you of changes to the Privacy Policy that we consider significant by posting a notice on the Services, but we encourage you to check back here from time to time to keep yourself apprised of any modifications.</p>

    <p> This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Studio SBV, Inc. d/b/a Oyster (“Oyster”, “we”, “our” or “us”) on the collection, use and disclosure of your information on www.oysterbooks.com (the “Site”) and the services, features, content or applications, including the Oyster mobile application (“Application”), we offer (collectively with the Site and the Application, the “Services”).</p>

    <p>We will receive information about you in various ways and from various sources. These include: </p>

    <ol>
      <li>if you register for the Site and the Services, through your user account on the Services (your “Account”)</li>
      <li>your use of the Services generally; and</li>
      <li>from third party websites and services. When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="question">
      <h5 class="question-title">What does this privacy policy cover?</h5>

      <div class="question-content">
        <p>This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. When you click on a third party logo displayed on or in the Services, and it links you to a different website or application, you are acknowledging that our Privacy Policy no longer applies to that website or application. You must read the privacy policies of the Third Party Services to see how your personal information will be handled on such Third Party Services.</p>

        <p>While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.</p>

        <p>In accordance with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly solicit or accept Personal Information from users known to be under thirteen years of age. If you are under the age of thirteen, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself.  If we learn that we have received any Personal Information from a user under thirteen years of age, we will take appropriate steps to remove that user’s Personal Information from our&nbsp;records.</p>

    <div class="question">
      <h5 class="question-title">What information do we collect?</h5>

      <div class="question-content">
        <p>The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information. We collect the following types of information from our users.</p>

        <div class="question-point">
          <h6 class="question-point-title">Account information:</h6>
          <div class="question-point-content">
            <p>When you create an Account, you will provide information that could be Personal Information, such as your username, password and email address. The information we collect here will be used to process your registration, your orders and payments, and to communicate with you about these topics, among others. We may also use the e-mail address provided to send you updates about us and the Services, including news about added features, special offers and promotions, surveys, and other general correspondence about the Services. If you do not want to receive certain types of communications from us, simply adjust your e-mail preferences through your Account settings.</p>

            <p>You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an account on the Services and providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not be anonymous. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, but as stated above, we will contact you only rarely when we feel such information is important.</p>

            <p>If you connect to the Services using your Facebook account, you are authorizing us to collect authentication information. This does not include your Facebook account password, but it does include your username, encrypted access credentials, and any other information that may be available on or through your Facebook account, including your name, profile picture, stated country of residence, hometown, e-mail address, date of birth, gender, and the names, pictures, and networks of your Facebook friends. We may store this information for two purposes: to personalize and improve your experience, and to verify your credentials with Facebook to ensure a smooth and optimal login flow. Your activities on Facebook are covered by the Facebook Terms and Policies. Additionally, if you connect the Services to your Twitter account, the Services will interact with Twitter in a number of ways, as described to you at the point of connection. As with Facebook, your activities on Twitter are covered by Twitter’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. We cannot and will not connect any of your accounts without your authorization.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-point">
          <h6 class="question-point-title">User content:</h6>
          <div class="question-point-content">
            <p>Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, such as written comments. All content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your account. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-point">
          <h6 class="question-point-title">Reading information:</h6>
          <div class="question-point-content">
            <p>We receive and record information regarding reading behavior on the services including, but not limited to, the books that users click or open, specific pages opened or read, and words displayed to end users.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-point">
          <h6 class="question-point-title">Financial information:</h6>
          <div class="question-point-content">
            <p>We may collect financial information, such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). &nbsp;In addition, such financial information is collected and stored by our third party payment processing company (the “Payment Processor”), and use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable terms of service and privacy policy.</p>

            <p>We may also collect some limited information related to processing your payment, such as your postal code, mobile number, and details of your transaction history with the Services. In addition, the Payment Processor may provide us with some limited information related to you, such as a unique token that enables you to make additional purchases using the information they have stored (this information may include your card’s type, expiration date, and the last four digits of your account number).</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-point">
          <h6 class="question-point-title">Information via find friends:</h6>
          <div class="question-point-content">
            <p>If you choose, you can use the Services to locate other people with Services accounts, and add them as your friends, either through (i) your contacts list (e.g., address book on your device), or (ii) through a search of e-mail addresses on the Service.  If you choose to find your friends through your device's contacts list, then we will access your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using the Services.  If you choose to find your friends through a search of our Services then simply type an e-mail address to search and we will perform a search on our Services.</p>

            <p>When you allow Oyster to access your contact list, the e-mail addresses in your contact list are hash encoded and sent to oyster's servers and compared to the hash-encoded email addresses of other oyster users. This process enables friends to find each other on the service. We do not store these hash-encoded email addresses. If you do not want oyster to have access to your contacts' email addresses, do not connect your contacts to Oyster using the “find friends” feature.</p>

We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.</li>

          <h6 class="question-point-title">Information related to advertising the use of web beacons:</h6>
          <div class="question-point-content">
            <p>To support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties to serve advertisements, through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called “ad networks.” &nbsp;Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.</p>

            <p>Advertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category, may be based on anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user, including Personal Information (e.g., gender or age), may be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use outside of the Services.</p>

            <p> To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>

      <div class="question-content">
        <p>The Services are designed to help you share information with others. As a result, some of the information generated through the Services is shared publicly or with third parties. </p>

If you do not want your activity on the Services to be public to other users, we generally give you settings to make your information more private if you so prefer.</p>

            <p>Registered users may have some of this information associated with their Accounts. Unregistered users will not have this association, but information concerning their use of the Services (such as what pages they have visited) may be tracked anonymously through the use of cookies and stored by us.</p>

            <p>Please also remember that, as with many social media, publishing and content-sharing platforms, if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the Services, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be publicly available. Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information.
