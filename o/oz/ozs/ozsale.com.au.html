                Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in a browser-related file
                on your computer's hard drive when you use our Web site. We use cookies to improve
                the member experience. We also use them to deliver information and fresh content
                specific to your interests. Cookies are widely used on most major Web sites.<br>
                <br>
                Ozsale mostly uses "session" cookies, which are removed from your computer once
                you leave Ozsale. These are used so our service can remember that you have logged
                in already and prevent you doing so more frequently. The technology we use (Microsoft
                .NET), requires the use of session cookies. Session cookies expire and are deleted
                after 30 minutes of no activity on Ozsale.<br>
                <br>
                Ozsale also uses persistent cookies to personalise the user experience, to help
                protect our members and to provide us with research information (such as how often
                members visit Ozsale each month). Persistent cookies allow us to track users on
                Ozsale and help us identify users abusing the Ozsale service.<br>
