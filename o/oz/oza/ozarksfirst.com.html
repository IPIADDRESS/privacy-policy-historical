("we," "us" or "our").&nbsp; We respect the privacy of visitors to our websites (each a "Site" and collectively the "Sites").<br><br>Because we gather certain types of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") from users of our Sites, we feel that you should know how we collect, use, disclose, manage and store your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy describes, among other things, the types of information collected about you when you visit a Site; how your information may be used and when it may be disclosed; how you can control the use and disclosure of your information; and how your information is protected.<br><br> This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may provide to us offline or through any means other than our Sites.&nbsp; For example, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you provide to us at a live event, when you respond to an invitation to enter a sweepstakes or contest, or to any other instances in which we may collect information from you offline.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy also does not cover any information collected through any other website, even if the other website is linked to our site. <br>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our online privacy practices. Your continued participation on our Sites indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information as described below.&nbsp; By visiting our Sites, you agree that your visit and any dispute regarding our privacy practices is governed by this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.<br>From time to time we may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our Personal Information collection and use practices, the features of the Sites or technology.&nbsp; Your continued use of the Site after we post a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.&nbsp; It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.<br><br>2.&nbsp; Your Disclosure of Information to Us<br><br>We believe that we can enhance your experience on our Sites through the information you share with us.&nbsp; However, you may choose to enjoy some of the content and features on our Sites without directly providing us with any information about you; but, as described below, some information is automatically collected when you visit our Site.&nbsp; In addition, in order for you to take advantage of certain features and services offered on our Sites, you may be required to provide us with Personal Information.<br>The Sites provide certain activities where we gather Personal Information from users of the Sites, such as an activity that requires that a user complete a registration process and receive/select a "user name" and password.&nbsp; Registration to participate in these Site activities may require the submission of your email address, zip code, date of birth and other Personal Information.&nbsp; Other Personal Information that may be submitted include your full name, postal address, phone number, password hints, gender, personal interests, industry you work in, occupation/role, household income, communication preferences, preferred news source, and any other information you provide to us in order to use a Site feature or service.&nbsp; If you choose to make a purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may also provide us with photographs or video materials that contain personal information about you.&nbsp; In addition, you may have the ability to opt-in to additional subscription services, such as email news alerts or promotional and marketing information to be received directly from our Advertisers (those who pay us to place advertisements on our Sites) which may require you to provide certain Personal Information.<br>We do not collect personal information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals except where you submit such information on their behalf (for example, if you submit a birthday notice with the person's name and email address).&nbsp; For certain activities you may be asked to submit a person's name, address, phone number or email address.<br>In addition to the information that you may provide to us, our servers also automatically collect information about you or your computer, including your browser type, operating system and computer monitor resolution; your Internet Protocol (IP) address (the number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet and that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area); sites you visited before and after visiting our Sites; web pages and advertisements you view and links you click on our Sites; unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers, that can identify the physical location of such devices in accordance with applicable law; information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies; information about your interactions with video content, such as the type of content viewed, and information about your interactions with email messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded; and standard server log information.<br>We also may collect information about you from other sources, including through interactive applications (such as mobile devices, third-party services, and embedded video players), from co-branded partners, and from commercially available sources (such as data aggregators and public databases).<br>Unless otherwise provided in a separate registration page, we do not request for marketing purposes contact information for a mobile phone, text messaging or any wireless device that includes a domain name address (such as "wireless.bellsouth.com") as part of the contact information.&nbsp; Federal law prohibits the sending of commercial marketing email messages directly to a wireless device that uses a domain name, unless you have first given your affirmative consent.&nbsp; We may inadvertently collect a wireless device number that includes a domain name when you send us an inquiry or register for a contest or membership club.&nbsp; However, we will not knowingly use that contact information for sending commercial marketing email.&nbsp; We reserve the right to respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless device that uses a domain name, as such messages are not deemed to be commercial marketing email.<br><br>3.&nbsp; Cookies and Similar Technologies<br><br>You should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected on the Sites through the use of "cookies," web beacons and other similar technologies.&nbsp; While such technologies do not contain personally identifiable information, once you choose to furnish our Sites with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in a cookie and such information may be used to personalize your experience with our Sites (for example, recognizing you by name when you return to a Site), saving your password in password protected areas or enabling you to use shopping carts on our Sites.&nbsp; Web beacons and cookies may also be used to collect, aggregate and analyze anonymous tracking data to help measure and track traffic and general user behavior.&nbsp; We may also use such technologies to help us offer you more relevant information or products and services of interest to you.&nbsp; Cookies also identify you to our servers allowing you the opportunity to avoid reentering your email and password each time you access the Sites.<br>Our third party service providers, advertisers and affiliates may use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies to manage or measure the performance of their information displayed or delivered over our Sites.&nbsp; For more information regarding this use, see our "Links to Third Party Providers" section below.<br>If you do not want information collected through the use of "cookies" there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept cookies.&nbsp; You may set your browser to accept all or certain cookies, block all or certain cookies, or require your consent before accepting a cookie.&nbsp; Blocking our cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from experiencing certain features of our Sites. <br>We also may use technical methods in our HTML emails that we send to you to determine whether you have opened or forwarded an email and/or clicked on links in those emails, to customize the display of banner advertising and other messages to you, to determine whether you have made an inquiry or purchase in response to a particular email and other similar activities.&nbsp;
