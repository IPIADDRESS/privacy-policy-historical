<b>PRIVACY POLICY
Updated November 2013</b><br><br>

<b>1.  General</b>
<br><br>
Thank you for visiting OzarksFirst.com, which is operated by KOLR and LOZL, affiliates of Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. and Mission Broadcasting, Inc. (“we,” “us” or “our”).  We respect the privacy of visitors to our websites (each a “Site” and collectively the “Sites”).  Because we gather certain types of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) from users of our Sites, we feel that you should know how we collect, use, disclose, manage and store your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy describes, among other things, the types of information collected about you when you visit a Site; how your information may be used and when it may be disclosed; how you can control the use and disclosure of your information; and how your information is protected.
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may provide to us offline or through any means other than our Sites.  For example, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you provide to us at a live event, when you fill out and submit a paper entry form to enter a sweepstakes or contest, or to any other instances in which we may collect information from you offline.  This Privacy Policy also does not cover any information collected through any other website, even if the other website is linked to our Sites.  
<br><br>
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our online privacy practices. Your continued participation on our Sites indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information as described below.  By visiting our Sites, you agree that your visit and any dispute regarding our privacy practices is governed by this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. 
<br><br>
From time to time we may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our Personal Information collection and use practices, the features of the Sites or technology.  Your continued use of the Sites after we post a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.  It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.
<br><br>
<b>2.  Your Disclosure of Information to Us</b>
<br><br>
We believe that we can enhance your experience on our Sites through the information you share with us.  However, you may choose to enjoy some of the content and features on our Sites without directly providing us with any information about you; but, as described below, some information is automatically collected when you visit our Sites.  In addition, in order for you to take advantage of certain features and services offered on our Sites, you may be required to provide us with Personal Information.
<br><br>
The Sites provide certain activities where we gather Personal Information from users of the Sites, such as an activity that requires that a user complete a registration process and receive/select a “user name” and password.  Registration to participate in these Site activities may require the submission of your email address, zip code, date of birth and other Personal Information.  Other Personal Information that may be submitted include your full name, postal address, phone number, password hints, gender, personal interests, industry you work in, occupation/role, household income, communication preferences, preferred news source, and any other information you provide to us in order to use a Site feature or service.  If you choose to make a purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address.   You may also provide us with photographs or video materials that contain personal information about you.  In addition, you may have the ability to opt-in to additional subscription services, such as email news alerts or promotional and marketing information to be received directly from our advertisers (those who pay us to place advertisements on our Sites) which may require you to provide certain Personal Information. 
<br><br>
We do not collect Personal Information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals except where you submit such information on their behalf (for example, if you submit a birthday notice with the person’s name and email address).  For certain activities you may be asked to submit a person’s name, address, phone number or email address.
<br><br>
In addition to the information that you may provide to us, our servers also automatically collect information about you or your computer, including your browser type, operating system and computer monitor resolution; your Internet Protocol (IP) address (the number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet and that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area); sites you visited before and after visiting our Sites; web pages and advertisements you view and links you click on our Sites; unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers, that can identify the physical location of such devices in accordance with applicable law; information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies; information about your interactions with video content, such as the type of content viewed, and information about your interactions with email messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded; and standard server log information.
<br><br>
We also may collect information about you from other sources, including through interactive applications (such as mobile devices, third-party services, and embedded video players), from co-branded partners, and from commercially available sources (such as data aggregators and public databases).
<br><br>
Unless otherwise provided in a separate registration page, we do not request for marketing purposes contact information for a mobile phone, text messaging or any wireless device that includes a domain name address (such as “wireless.bellsouth.com”) as part of the contact information.  Federal law prohibits the sending of commercial marketing email messages directly to a wireless device that uses a domain name, unless you have first given your affirmative consent.  We may inadvertently collect a wireless device number that includes a domain name when you send us an inquiry or register for a contest or membership club.  However, we will not knowingly use that contact information for sending commercial marketing email.  We reserve the right to respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless device that uses a domain name, as such messages are not deemed to be commercial marketing email.
<br><br>
<b>3.  Cookies and Similar Technologies</b>
<br><br>
You should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected on the Sites through the use of “cookies,” web beacons and other similar technologies.  While such technologies do not contain Personal Information, once you choose to furnish our Sites with Personal Information, this information may be linked to the data stored in a cookie and such information may be used to personalize your experience with our Sites (for example, recognizing you by name when you return to a Site), saving your password in password protected areas or enabling you to use shopping carts on our Sites.  Web beacons and cookies may also be used to collect, aggregate and analyze anonymous tracking data to help measure and track traffic and general user behavior.  We may also use such technologies to help us offer you more relevant information or products and services of interest to you.  Cookies also identify you to our servers allowing you the opportunity to avoid reentering your email and password each time you access the Sites.
<br><br>
Our third party service providers, advertisers and affiliates may use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies to manage or measure the performance of their information displayed or delivered over our Sites.  For more information regarding this use, please see our “Links to Third Party Websites” section below.
<br><br>
If you do not want information collected through the use of “cookies” there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept cookies.  You may set your browser to accept all or certain cookies, block all or certain cookies, or require your consent before accepting a cookie.  Blocking our cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from experiencing certain features of our Sites.  
<br><br>
We also may use technical methods in our HTML emails that we send to you to determine whether you have opened or forwarded an email and/or clicked on links in those emails, to customize the display of banner advertising and other messages to you, to determine whether you have made an inquiry or purchase in response to a particular email and other similar activities.  These technical methods may enable us to collect and use your Personal Information.
<br><br>
<b>4.  Social Networking</b>
<br><br>
You also can engage with our content, such as video, games, applications, and other offerings, on or through third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter and other third-party social media plug-ins and applications. When you engage with our content on or through third party social networking sites, plug-ins and applications, you may allow us to have access to certain information from your social media profile (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the “likes” you make) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the application.  We may also obtain non-personally identifiable information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on,) from your interaction with our content.
<br><br>
When you provide information from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (1) give you exclusive content, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our applications or websites, and (3) contact you through the social networking sites or directly by sending you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards.  By doing so, you consent to the use of this information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.  When you provide Personal Information to us through an application, on our Sites, or on social networking sites, it may be publicly viewed by other members of these sites and we cannot prevent further use of the information by third parties.
<br><br>
Through some social networking sites’ privacy settings, you can control what data you share. For more information about how social networking sites handle your Personal Information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use.
<br><br>
<b>5. Our Use of Your Information</b>
<br><br>
We use your Personal Information to provide you with features, services or goods, or information you request, to respond to your questions or comments related to us or the Sites, and to enable you to participate in features such as surveys, polls, sweepstakes, and message boards. We also use your Personal Information to notify you about updates, new features, programming and activities that may be of interest to you.  We may use the information to communicate with you when you have won a contest or sweepstakes, or to contact you about your account with us.  We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards or emails you may wish to send them from our Sites.
<br><br>
We may use your information for hiring, operational and business purposes, or to find out how we can improve our company and Sites via surveys or online tracking mechanisms.  We may use aggregated Personal Information collected directly during the registration process and/or via cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to help us evaluate and modify existing services and features, as well as provide demographic and geographic information to advertisers.  We may also use your Personal Information to develop new services and features that may be of interest to you. 
<br><br>
We may use the information you provide about yourself or others to enforce the legal terms of use for our Sites and for any other purpose for which you provided the information.
<br><br>    
If you choose to submit content for publication we may publish your screen name and/or other information you have provided.
<br><br>
Although we hope you find the information we provide to you through our Sites to be useful, you may always opt out of receiving communications from us by changing your privacy preferences in your member profile, or by deleting your profile from our database.   Please see the opt-out procedures in “Your Choices Regarding Your Information” section set forth below for more information.
<br><br>
<b>6.  Our Disclosure of Your Information</b>
<br><br>
We may share information, including your Personal Information, with our affiliates, service providers and advertisers.  We also may disclose your Personal Information in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request; when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or to anyone that could be harmed by such activities; in situations involving threats to the physical safety of any person; where it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activity or suspected fraud; or as otherwise required by law.  We may transfer Personal Information about you if we are acquired by, sold to or merged with another company.  
<br><br>
Our agents and contractors who have access to your Personal Information are required to protect the information in a manner consistent with our Privacy Policy and may not use the information for any other purposes other than to carry out the activity they are performing on our behalf.  However, we may disclose your Personal Information to third parties who are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., marketers, retailers, non-profit organizations, participatory databases) that want to market products or services to you.  We may also share your non-personally identifiable information with third parties in order to provide you with more relevant product and service opportunities.
<br><br>
When you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to sponsors and third parties who help administer the promotion, including in connection with winner selection and prize fulfillment.  Your Personal Information also may be disclosed as required by law, such as on a winners list.  Also, by entering a promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, including allowing the sponsors to use your name, voice, and likeness in advertising and marketing associated with the promotion in accordance with applicable law.
<br><br>
We and our affiliated Sites continue to expand our online presence in order to offer users rich and deep interactive experiences.  We may share information we collect about you among our Sites so that we can provide you with information about products and services that might interest you.
<br><br>
We may share aggregated or anonymized information with third parties.  This information cannot be used to individually identify you.  Much of the information we collect is in the form of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic generated by visits on various pages within our Sites, and the habits and preferences of our audience.  Such aggregated information does not include any information that would identify you personally. We may use such aggregated information and disclose it to third parties as we see fit.
<br><br>
If you have signed up to receive our emails and prefer not to receive marketing information from our Sites, follow the unsubscribe instructions provided on any such email you receive from our Sites.
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy addresses only our use of information we collect from you online.   It does not apply to information you choose to disclose to other parties whether through chat rooms, forums, personal ads or interactive areas of our Sites that allow you to submit or post your own content or the like.  We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety.  Accordingly, information you disclose on message boards, in chat rooms and forums, through content you provide or in any other way can be viewed, collected and/or used by others and we are not responsible for information you disclose in this manner. 
<br><br>
<b>7.  Links to Third Party Websites</b>
<br><br>
We may sometimes offer content that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties.  The Sites also may contain links to the websites of third parties not affiliated with us.  In addition, if you click on an advertiser’s advertisement, you will link to the advertiser’s web site.  Some of the advertisements and other links on our Sites are delivered by third parties who also collect information through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies about your online activities.  These third parties include advertisers, advertising agencies, and ad networks that may collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements.
<br><br>
In all of the above instances this Privacy Policy will not apply to Personal Information collected by these third parties.  This collection of information is not under our control and such third party information practices may be different than ours.  Once you leave our Sites via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third parties or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any information that they collect from you.  You understand, acknowledge and agree that these links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by us.  We are NOT responsible for the privacy practices or the content on any of these other web sites, including any sites that may indicate a special relationship or “partnership” with us.  If you decide to access any of the third-party sites linked to the Sites, you do so entirely at your own risk.
<br><br>
Some of these third parties may collect information about your interests to deliver relevant advertising to you.  These companies may offer you a way to choose not to have your information used for advertising purposes. Please note that if you choose to opt out of having your information used to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, you will continue to see advertisements on our Sites, but these advertisements may not be as relevant to you.
<br><br>
<b>8.  Your Choices Regarding Your Information.</b>
<br><br>
We respect your privacy and your ability to choose what information you share with us.  If you receive any communication from us that you prefer not to receive you may opt out of receiving further communications from us.  To remove any personal information from our database or to not receive future e-mail communications from us, you may modify your contact options in your profile (if applicable) or send an e-mail to PrivacyAdministrator@nexstar.tv with the word “remove” in the subject line.  
<br><br>
You may “opt-out” altogether from providing us with any Personal Information by not registering on the Sites or for any Site sponsored promotion, contest or sweepstakes, etc.  Or you may choose to remove your name from our database at any time by deleting your registration profile.  You may also opt out of receiving commercial email or text messages by following the instructions contained in any such message.  However, even if you unsubscribe to commercial messages, we still may need to send you communications relating to your use of our Sites, such as service announcements.  
<br><br>
If you ask us to shut down your account or delete your information, we will disable your account within a reasonable period of time.  However, we may need to retain some information about you in order to satisfy our legal and security obligations.  For example, some of your information may remain in back-up storage even if you ask us to delete it. 
<br><br>

<b>9.  How You Can Review or Correct Your Personal Information</b>
<br><br>
If you created a password protected account within our Sites, you can access that account to review and update the Personal Information you provided.  You also may update or amend your information by contacting us at PrivacyAdministrator@nexstar.tv. We will provide you with a list of your Personal Information within thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of your request. There may be certain instances when we may not be able to provide the Personal Information, such as when access would violate the privacy of another individual or when access is prohibited by law.
<br><br>
<b>10.  Your California Privacy Rights</b>
<br><br>
California law allows California residents, once a year and free of charge, to request information about certain types of Personal Information (if any) that a business has disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year.  However, under the law, we are not required to provide this information as long as we: (1) notify you that you have the right to prevent disclosure of Personal Information, and (2) provide you with a cost-free means to exercise that right.  As noted in this Privacy Policy, we require California residents to opt in to activities where we would share their Personal Information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  If you are a California resident and you would like to prevent disclosure of your Personal Information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to participate in these activities.  If you are a California resident, and you have opted in to one of these activities, but you later decide that you would like to discontinue our disclosure of your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please see our opt-out procedures set forth above in “Your Choices Regarding Your Information” section for information regarding how to discontinue such disclosure.
<br><br>  
<b>10.  Security of Information</b>
<br><br>
We take reasonable security precautions to secure the Personal Information that you choose to provide against the loss, misuse, alteration or unauthorized access of such information.  Unfortunately, no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under our control to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully.  While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Information that you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk. 
We do not and will not ever request your login information, password or credit card information in an unsecured or unsolicited email or telephone communication.  This practice is commonly known as “phishing.”  For more information about “phishing” and protecting your Personal Information from identity theft, you may want to visit the Federal Trade Commission at www.ftc.gov.  
<br><br>
<b>11.  Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy</b>
<br><br>
Our Sites are intended for a general audience and we do not knowingly collect or store contact information about children under the age of 13.  We may ask for a birth date to ensure that we are not collecting information from children under 13 or to identify when additional steps may need to be taken in connection with information collected from children under 18.  In those instances where we have actual knowledge that we are collecting information from children or the Sites offer a service directed toward children, we will comply with applicable laws, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.
<br><br>
<b>12.  Applicable Law</b>
<br><br>
We control and operate our Sites from the United States. The Sites are not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. Please note that we do not represent or warrant that the Sites  are appropriate for use in any particular jurisdiction.  Those who choose to access the Sites do so at their own initiative and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations.  Further by using and participating in our Sites or providing us with your information, you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the United States.
<br><br>
<b>13.  Updates</b>
