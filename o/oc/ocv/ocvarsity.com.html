      <p>This is the Privacy Policy for all Web sites owned or operated by Freedom Communications,
       Inc. ("Freedom" "we" or "our"), including, without limitation the Web sites listed <a href="ppsites.html">here</a>
       (collectively, the "Site"). We respect your privacy and appreciate the confidence you have 
       placed in the Site. We are committed to protecting your privacy and preserving your trust. 
       Please carefully review this Privacy Policy to learn about how we collect, use, and protect 
       any personal information you provide us and your choices for managing your personal information. 
       This Privacy Policy is subject to the <a href="eula.html">User Agreement</a> posted on the Site.</p>
       
      <p><b>Managing Information Preferences</b></p> 
      <p>We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you have questions or 
        concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or if you wish to exclude your personal information 
        from our direct marketing purposes, please feel free to contact us at: <br><br>

        Irvine , CA 92614<br>
        E-mail: <a href="mailto:pp@freedom.com">pp@freedom.com</a><br><br>
        If you would like to correct, update, or change your personal information with us please contact us the same way.</p>
        
      <p><b>What Types Of Information Do We Collect?</b></p>
          
      <p>We collect information that may personally identify you (such as your name, address, 
      telephone number, email address, billing information, or other data which can be reasonably 
      linked to such information) only if you choose to share such information with us. For example, 
      we may collect personal information from you when you register on the Site, subscribe to one 
      of our services, enter sweepstakes, contests or other promotions, and at other times. We also 
      collect credit card information in connection with any purchase you make on or through the 
      Site. The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you decide not to 
      register or provide such information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Site 
      or other services.<br><br>
      We may automatically collect non-personal information that does not identify an individual 
      user, such as IP (internet protocol) address, ISP (internet service provider), the Web browser 
      used to visit the Site, the time the Site is visited, which Web pages were visited on the Site, 
      a unique mobile device identifier (in connection with the use of the Sites or related services 
      from mobile devices) and other anonymous Site usage data.<br><br>
      We also use cookies (a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies 
      your Web browser) and Web beacons (an electronic file placed within a Web site that monitors usage). 
      We use cookies and Web beacons to improve the quality of the Site. Most Web browsers are initially 
      set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate 
      when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the Site may not work if you delete or 
      disable cookies. Certain of our Service Providers (defined below) may use cookies and Web beacons 
      in connection with the services they perform on our behalf, including, without limitation, ad serving.
      </p>
      
      <p><b>How Do We Use The Information We Collect?</b></p>
      <p>We will not sell, share, or rent personal information to third parties, and we will not 
      otherwise disclose personal information to third parties, without your permission, except 
      as disclosed in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
      We use personal information and non-personal information for internal purposes, including: 
      </p><ul>
        <li>enhancing your experience at the Site;</li>
        <li>performing administration and technical support for the Site; </li>
        <li>enabling you to enter sweepstakes, contests and other promotions;</li>
        <li>enabling you to use certain services and features available on or through the Site;</li>
        <li>creating aggregate information about demographics and usage patterns; </li>
        <li>inviting our promotional vendors and advertisers—with your permission—to call to 
            your attention special offers, products and services that may be of interest to you; and </li>
        <li>enabling purchases of goods and services.</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>We may use aggregate information to measure general Site usage patterns and characteristics 
	  of our user base, and we may include such aggregate information about our audience in reports 
	  to our commercial vendors. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, a 
	  certain percentage of our users live in a certain area) without your permission in order to 
	  describe our audience to existing and prospective advertisers or other third parties. However, 
	  this aggregate information does not reference names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, or other 
	  personal information, and it is not traceable to a specific recipient or user e-mail address.
	  </p>
	  <p>We also may share personal information with entities controlling, controlled by, or under 
	  common control with Freedom. In the event that Freedom is merged, or in the event of a transfer 
	  of our assets, we may disclose or transfer your personal information and non-personal information 
	  in connection with such transaction.
	  </p>
	  <p>
        From time to time, we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom 
        we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent 
        with ours ("Service Providers"). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain 
        services including credit card processing, advertising, promotions, analytics tools, data management, 
        Web hosting, and Web development. We provide our Service Providers with the information needed for them 
        to perform these services. Each Service Provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security 
        procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of your information in order to protect your personal 
        information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.
        </p> 
      <p>We may work with third-party advertising companies which may use information about your visit 
      to the Site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest 
      to you on the Site and on third-party Web sites.  From the Site, these companies may place or 
      recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as Web beacons or pixel 
      tags. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party advertisement 
      serving company may collect from you. For more information about ad cookies and companies that 
      provide users the ability to "opt-out" of the collection of information from such cookies, 
      please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>  
	  <p>Although unlikely, in certain instances we may disclose your personal information when we have 
	  reason to believe it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or 
	  entities who may be causing injury to you, to Freedom or its affiliates, or to others. We may 
	  also disclose your personal information when we believe the law or legal process requires such 
	  disclosure. Please note that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, may have the 
	  authority under certain circumstances to permit your personal information to be shared or 
	  transferred to third parties without your permission.
      </p>
      
	  <p><b>Security</b></p>
	  <p>We use encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of personal information 
	  that you share with us. However, no data transmission over the Internet (or, with respect to 
	  our mobile services, over cellular phone networks) can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a 
	  result, while we strive to protect personal information, we cannot and do not guarantee or 
	  warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from the Site, and you do so at 
	  your own risk.</p>
	  
	  <p><b>Links To Third-Party Web Sites</b></p>
	  <p>The Site may contain links to Web sites operated and maintained by third parties, over 
	  which we have no control. Privacy policies on such linked Web sites may be different from 
	  our Privacy Policy. You access such linked Web sites at your own risk. You should always 
	  read the privacy policy of a linked Web site before disclosing any personal information 
	  on such site.</p>
	  
	  <p><b>Discussion Board, Forums and Other User Generated Content</b></p>
	  <p>Our online chat areas, bulletin boards, social networks, mobile messaging services, other 
	  public forums and user-generated content (i.e., photos, videos) can be a useful way for you 
	  to express yourself to other online users. When you post messages or otherwise use these 
	  features, the information that you provide (including personal information) may be publicly 
	  available to, collected by, and used by third parties. We are not responsible for the content 
	  of such messages or images posted by users or such disclosures of personal information.</p>
	  
	  <p><b>Children's Privacy Statement</b></p>
	  <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.  If 
	  we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a child under 
	  the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.</p>
	  <p><b>Policy Changes</b></p>
	  <p>If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, we will inform you by 
	  posting the changed Privacy Policy on the Site. Your continued use of the Site constitutes 
	  your agreement to abide by the Privacy Policy as changed. If you object to any such changes, 
	  your sole recourse shall be to cease using the Site.</p>
