<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Body" -->
  <p>We know that by choosing Ocado to deliver your groceries, you've placed
    a great deal of trust in us. We also understand that you want the personal
    information you give us to be kept private as well as secure. To reassure
    you that we feel the same way, here's how we will and, more importantly,
    will not use the personal information you give us.</p>
  <p class="smallgrey">This Privacy Policy was most recently updated on 5<sup>th</sup> January
    2004.</p>
  <h3 class="level3">What we collect and why</h3>
  <p> When you shop with Ocado, there are different ways we gather information
    about you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When you register with us, we ask for information such as your name,
      e-mail address, delivery address, contact details and, if you place an
      order, your credit card details. We keep a record of this information.All
      this is necessary for us to recognise you as a registered customer and
      to fulfil the orders you place with us. Storing this information means
      you do not need to re-enter these details each time you shop.</li>
    <li> We keep a record of your purchases with us, which means we can create
      lists of your favourite items to make your shopping experience quicker
      and more convenient. It also means we can deal a lot quicker with any problems
      you may experience with your order. </li>
    <li>We keep a record of any e-mail correspondence you send us. This helps
      us keep track of your likes and dislikes and any problems or concerns you've
      had with our products or services.</li>
    <li> Telephone calls made to our Customer Service Helpline may be recorded
      for monitoring and quality control purposes.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="level3">Cookies and Online Marketing Management Tools</h3>
  <p>Cookies are small text files that web sites can send to your computer. A
    cookie can be thought of as an internet user's identification card, which
    tells a web site when the user has returned. Cookies are not computer programs,
    and can't read other information saved on your hard drive. They cannot be
    used to disseminate viruses, or get a user's e-mail address etc. They only
    contain and transfer to the web site as much information as the users themselves
    have disclosed to that web site.</p>
  <p>Cookies make the interaction between users and web sites faster and easier.
    Without cookies, it would be very difficult for a web site to allow a visitor
    to fill up a shopping trolley or to remember the user's preferences or registration
    details for a future visit. The Ocado website uses cookies to allow customers
    to move from one part of the web site to another and to add items to the
    shopping trolley without having to login repeatedly. It also allows us to
    give you accurate information about your account and order history.</p>
  <p>Ocado uses digital marketing organisations to attract new customers to our
    site. In order to track where new customers come from the digital marketing
    organisations provide us with technology such as pixels and transparent GIF
    files. That technology works by recognising a cookie on your web browser
    enabling us to identify which advert brought you to us. The technology is
    not able to identify any of your personal details.</p>
  <p>The European Union Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the "Directive"),
    which came into force on 31st July 2002, recognises that cookies are a "legitimate
    and useful tool" for many activities, including verifying the identity
    of web site users. The Directive makes it compulsory for web sites to inform
    users if cookies are being used (which is exactly what we are doing here!),
    and to provide some information on how cookies are used. You can find more
    information on this subject at <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org">aboutcookies.org</a>.
    Lastly, the Directive places an obligation on web sites to make users aware
    that they can set their computers to reject cookies. You will find the instructions
    on how to do this at <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/controlcookies.html">aboutcookies.org</a>.
    However, you should be aware that the Ocado website (in common with most
    other shopping web sites) will not work without cookies. </p>
  <h3 class="level3">How We Use Your Personal Data</h3>
  <p> All the information we collect via our website or through correspondence
    with you is used to operate and improve the service we offer you. We are
    committed to using your personal information only for: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dealing with orders and accounts for the supply of our goods and services.</li>
    <li>Planning and managing Ocado business activities, including analysing
      customers' shopping habits and preferences.</li>
    <li>Research. </li>
    <li>Providing you with information about the products and services we offer.</li>
    <li>Providing you with any promotional offers that we can arrange from third
      parties.</li>
    <li>Assessing your request for delivery of groceries from us where we may
      make enquiries about you including searching your records held by organisations
      like Experian and Equifax and credit reference agencies. We may also disclose
      your address and postcode details to check against by the IMRG Security
      Alert scheme or any other fraud prevention schemes.</li>
    <li>Enabling our debt collection agency to collect payment from you should
      that be necessary.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>At all times where we use or disclose your information it will remain secure.</p>
  <p> There are only four circumstances where we may share some of your data
    with others:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>With Waitrose and other John Lewis Partnership companies.</li>
    <li>With agents (including credit reference agencies, fraud prevention and
      detection agencies and debt collection agencies) that we use to process
      the orders you place with us or who assist us in the service we provide
      to you. In these instances, we provide them with only the information they
      need to perform their function.</li>
    <li>In the unlikely event that our business assets are ever sold to or purchased
      by another company. (Our data records are part of our business).</li>
    <li> To outside research companies whom we may ask to contact you directly
      for your opinions on our products and services (in which case we provide
      them with only the information they need to perform their function).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="level3">How we DO NOT use your personal data</h3>
  <p>We will never to sell or rent your data to anyone else for their marketing
    purposes unless you agree otherwise.</p>
  <h3 class="level3">Data over the Internet</h3>
  <p>The internet is a global network - therefore there are cases where your
    data travels internationally, which may include places outside the European
    Union. We want you to know that if you visit or shop with Ocado, you're agreeing
    and authorising us to process data this way.</p>
  <h3 class="level3">Further information</h3>

    contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ocado.com">privacy@ocado.com</a>. To
    see all the information we have about you, and to correct any inaccuracies,
    write to:</p>
<p>The Company Secretary, 
    Ocado Ltd., 
    Titan Court, 
    Hatfield Business Park,
Hatfield, AL10 9NE.</p>
