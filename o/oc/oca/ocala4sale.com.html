					<p style="text-align: left"><b>Privacy Policy</b><br>
					At Ocala4sale.com, we take your privacy very seriously. 
					This policy states what happens to your personal information 
					when you use our Web sites. This policy does not apply to 
					the companies and websites that we advertise or endorse. 
					Please visit their Web sites for their policy regarding how 
					they handle personal information. </p>
					<p style="text-align: left"><b>What We Collect</b><br>
					When you use our sites we collect several pieces of 
					information including your name, email address, phone 
					number,  
					your ad, your feedback, discussions and posts to our 
					message boards, and where applicable physical or billing 
					address, and billing information. Additionally, our servers collect information when you view our site or post an ad, including 
					browser information, referrer information, timestamp, page 
					URL, and your IP address. We collect this information to 
					analyze trends, administer the site, improve site 
					performance and gather broad demographic information for 
					aggregate use. <br>
					<br>
					For free ads, we require a valid phone number and email address. Paid ads require all information 
					necessary for billing purposes including credit card, bank, 
					and check information.</p>
					<p style="text-align: left"><b>What Happens to Information 
					We Collect</b><br>
					Primarily you can expect that your ad, comments, feedback, and 
					phone number will be published for all the World Wide Web to 
					see. Most email addresses are hidden from public view. 
					However,&nbsp; any web user may responded to your ad. 
					Replying will disclose your email address to those who 
					respond to your ad. We publish not only to the Web, but also to a list of 
					email subscribers, partner websites, and print publications. Your ad may appear in 
					these places, as well. </p>
					<p style="text-align: left">We may retain all correspondence whether made by fax, email, 
					or an online form. We may aggregate, categorize, and analyze 
					the information received.&nbsp; Further, we may use the ideas, concepts, 
				know-how or techniques contained in your correspondence to develop, 
					manufacture, and market products or services. <br>
					<br>
					Electronic information is kept on secured networks. Printed 
					and written information is supervised or secured at all 
					times. Although we make a good faith effort to keep all 
					information secure, we cannot guarantee complete security. 
					All information is stored indefinitely. <br>
					<br>
					Much of our billing is done though PayPal. Click here for their 
					privacy policy. <a href="http://www.paypal.com/privacy">
					http://www.paypal.com/privacy</a> <br>
					<br>
					Many search engines and other sites archive or otherwise 
					make available the content published on our site. Presently, 
					we allow it so that people might find your ad more readily.</p>
					<p style="text-align: left"><b>What We Don't Do</b><br>
					Although we publish a website of ads that make people's 
					phone numbers and email addresses publicly available, we do 
					not make or sell a simplified list of such information. 
					Further, we discourage the use of number and address 
					harvesters. <br>
					<br>
					We do not knowingly collect information from a person under 
					the age of 13. If we discover an ad was submitted by someone 
					under 13, we will remove the ad from publication. Further, 
					we make every attempt to remove age information placed by 
					young people 13 years and older.<br>
					<br>
					We do not make available for download nor cause to download 
					to the computers of users of our sites, programs that 
					collect information about Web browsing habits or cause 
					unsolicited advertising such as ad-ware, spy-ware, or 
					browser hijacks. </p>
					<p style="text-align: left"><b>What we recommend.</b><br>
					We recommend a few ideas for safer buying and selling. <br>
					<br>
					1. Create and use an email address that is not your primary 
					address. Many sites offer free email -- Hotmail, 
					Yahoo!, etc.<br>
					3. Place in your ad only the things that you want to be 
					public.<br>
					2. Do not use an unlisted phone number. <br>
					4. Do not reply to messages offering more than the asking 
					price. For more details, read

					USA4SALE Networks sites may set and access cookies on your

					<p style="text-align: left"><b>Law Enforcement and Third Parties</b><br>
					Ocala4sale.com will provide information to law 
					enforcement agencies. We respond to subpoenas, court orders, 
					or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal 
					rights or defend against legal claims. We share information 
					in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding 
					illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving

					violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by 
					law. <br>
					<br>

					fraud, we may verify with third parties the information you 
					provide.</p>
					<p style="text-align: left"><b>Changes to this Privacy 
					Policy</b><br>
