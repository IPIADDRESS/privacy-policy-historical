	Ochsner’s Pledge Regarding Your Medical Information</h4>
<p>
	Your medical information is personal and Ochsner is committed to keeping this information confidential. Maintaining a record of the care and services you receive at the hospital and clinic enables us to provide you with quality care and comply with certain legal requirements. This notice applies to use and disclosure of all your medical records generated in the Ochsner Health System, including our hospitals, clinics and medical staff at Ochsner Medical Center, Ochsner Hospital – Elmwood, Ochsner St. Anne General Hospital, Ochsner Medical Center – West Bank, Ochsner Baptist Medical Center, Ochsner Medical Center – Kenner, Ochsner Medical Center – Baton Rouge, Ochsner Medical Center - North Shore and Ochsner Home Health.</p>
<p>
	In addition, there may be instances where Ochsner will share your protected health information with members of our Organized Health Care Arrangement as allowed under HIPAA regulations and as necessary to carry out treatment, payment or health care operations. These members include patient care settings affiliated with the Ochsner Health System, and all medical staff, employees, volunteers, trainees, students and other personnel providing services as employed by these facilities.</p>
<p>
	Ochsner Health System may elect to participate in secure statewide or regional health information networks designed and developed to promote healthcare continuity.</p>
<p>
	Your healthcare information may be included in this HIPAA compliant secure network and accessed only by healthcare personnel involved in your healthcare. This type of network will allow for secure and appropriate access to your important healthcare information in the event of a serious disaster or any displacement you may experience in the future.</p>
<p>
	This notice details the ways in which Ochsner may use and disclose medical information about you, describes your rights and explains certain obligations we have regarding the use and disclosure of your medical information. Additionally, if your doctor is not a member of the physician practice that is owned by Ochsner Clinic Foundation, he or she may have different policies about how to handle your information and a separate notice.</p>
<p>
	Ochsner is required by law to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Make sure that medical information that identifies you is kept private;</li>
	<li>
		Give you this notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to your medical information; and</li>
	<li>
		Follow the terms of the notice that is currently in effect.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	How Ochsner May Use and Disclose&nbsp;Your Medical Information</h4>
<p>
	Ochsner Health System may use or disclose your medical information for the following reasons:</p>
<p>
	<strong>Treatment</strong><br>
	Ochsner may use your medical information to provide treatment or services. Ochsner may disclose your medical information to doctors, nurses, technicians, medical students or other hospital/clinic personnel who are involved in taking care of you.<br>
	For example, a doctor treating you for a broken leg may need to know if you have diabetes because diabetes may slow the healing process. In addition, the doctor may need to tell the dietitian if you have diabetes to ensure meals are appropriate.<br>
	Hospital or clinic departments may share medical information about you to coordinate prescriptions, lab work and x-rays. Ochsner may disclose your medical information to individuals outside the facility who may be involved in your care.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Payment</strong><br>
	Payment Ochsner may use and disclose your medical information to bill for the treatment and services you receive at our facilities and to collect payments from an insurance company, third party or you.<br>
	For example, your health plan may require specific information about surgery you received at the hospital to pay Ochsner or reimburse you. Ochsner may also tell your health plan about a treatment you will receive to obtain prior approval or determine whether the treatment is covered by your plan.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Hospital/Clinic Operations/Home Health</strong><br>
	Ochsner may use and disclose your medical information to measure and ensure the quality of hospital/clinic/home health operations.<br>
	For example, Ochsner may use medical information to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Review treatment and services received to assess the performance of our staff in caring for you</li>
	<li>
		Combine medical information about multiple hospital or clinic patients to decide which additional services Ochsner should offer, which are not needed and whether certain new treatments are effective</li>
	<li>
		Educate doctors, nurses, technicians, medical students and other hospital/clinic personnel</li>
	<li>
		Compare medical information at Ochsner with other healthcare providers to improve the care and services Ochsner offers</li>
	<li>
		Ochsner may remove information that identifies you from this set of medical information so others may use it to study healthcare and healthcare delivery without recognizing the specific patients.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Business Associates</strong><br>
	Associates Ochsner may use and disclose your medical information to business associates who perform services on our behalf. The business associate must agree in writing to protect the confidentiality of the information.&nbsp;For example, Ochsner may share your health information with a company that bills for the services we provide.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Appointment Reminders</strong><br>
	Ochsner may use and disclose your medical information to remind you about an appointment for a treatment, service, annual exams or prescription refills.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Treatment Alternatives</strong><br>
	Ochsner may use and disclose your medical information to tell you about or recommend possible treatment options or alternatives that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Health-related Benefits and Services</strong><br>
	Ochsner may use and disclose your medical information to tell you about health-related benefits or services that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Fundraising Activities</strong><br>
	Ochsner may use and disclose your medical information to Philanthropy so they may contact you in an effort to raise money for our organization.<br>
	However, Ochsner will only release contact information such as your name, address, age, gender, phone Number and dates you received treatment or services. If you do not want to be contacted for fundraising efforts, you must notify Ochsner’s Philanthropy Department in writing.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Hospital Directory</strong><br>
	Ochsner may include certain limited information about you in the hospital directory while you are a patient at the hospital without your authorization unless you object to being included in the directory. This information may include your name, location in the hospital, general condition (e.g., fair, stable, etc.), and religious affiliation (if provided). The directory information (excluding your religious affiliation) may be released to people who ask for you by name so your family and friends can visit you in the hospital and find out how you are doing.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Individuals Involved in Your Care</strong><br>
	Ochsner may discuss medical information about you with a friend or family member who is involved in your medical care. Ochsner may also tell your family or friends your condition and that you are in the hospital. In addition, Ochsner may disclose medical information about you to an entity assisting in a disaster relief effort to inform your family of your condition, status and location.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Research</strong><br>
	Under certain circumstances, Ochsner may use and disclose your medical information for research purposes.<br>
	For example, a research project may involve comparing the health and recovery of all patients who received one medication with those who received another for the same condition.<br>
	All research projects, however, are subject to a special approval process. This process includes an evaluation to balance research needs with privacy concerns. The research project must be approved before Ochsner will use or disclose any medical information with one exception: your medical information may be disclosed to people preparing to conduct a research project.<br>
	For example, information may be needed to identify patients with specific medical needs. This is permitted; however, the medical information must remain within our institution.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Required By Law</strong><br>
	Ochsner will disclose medical information about you when required to do so by federal, state or local law.<br>
	For example, Ochsner will release information to comply with the law regarding reporting deaths.</p>
<p>
	<strong>To Avert a Serious Threat to Health or Safety</strong><br>
