and 
try 
to 
give 
some 
examples. 
Not 
every 
use 
or 
disclosure 
in 
a 
category 
will 
be 
listed. 
However, 
all 
of 
the 
ways 
we 
are 
permitted 
to 
use 
and 
disclose 
information 
will 
fall 
within 
one 
of 
the 
categories.</p>
<p>
<b>
For 
Treatment:</b> 
We 
may 
use 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
to 
provide 
you 
with 
medical 
treatment 
or 
services. 
We 
may 
disclose 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
to 
doctors, 
nurses, 
technicians, 
medical 
students, 
or 
other 
hospital/clinic 
personnel 
who 
are 
involved 
in 
taking 
care 
of 
you. 
For 
example, 
a 
doctor 
treating 
you 
for 
a 
broken 
leg 
may 
need 
to 
know 
if 
you 
have 
diabetes 
because 
diabetes 
may 
slow 
the 
healing 
process. 
In 
addition, 
the 
doctor 
may 
need 
to 
tell 
the 
dietitian 
if 
you 
have 
diabetes 
so 
that 
we 
can 
arrange 
for 
appropriate 
meals. 
Different 
departments 
of 
the 
hospital 
or 
clinic 
also 
may 
share 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
in 
order 
to 
coordinate 
the 
different 
things 
you 
need, 
such 
as 
prescriptions, 
lab 
work 
and 
x-rays. 
With 
your 
permission, 
we 
also 
may 
disclose 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
to 
individuals 
outside 
the 
facility 
who 
may 
be 
involved 
in 
your 
care.</p>
<p>
<b>
For 
Payment</b>: 
We 
may 
use 
and 
disclose 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
so 
that 
the 
treatment 
and 
services 
you 
receive 
at 
our 
facilities 
may 
be 
billed 
to, 
and 
payment 
may 
be 
collected 
from, 
an 
insurance 
company, 
a 
third 
party, 
or 
you. 
For 
example, 
we 
may 
need 
to 
give 
your 
health 
plan 
information 
about 
surgery 
you 
received 
at 
the 
hospital 
so 
your 
health 
plan 
will 
pay 
us 
or 
reimburse 
you 
for 
the 
surgery. 
We 
may 
also 
tell 
your 
health 
plan 
about 
a 
treatment 
you 
are 
going 
to 
receive 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
prior 
approval 
or 
to 
determine 
whether 
your 
plan 
will 
cover 
the 
treatment.</p>
<p>
<b>
For 
Hospital/Clinic 
Operations</b>: 
We 
may 
use 
and 
disclose 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
for 
hospital/clinic 
operations. 
These 
uses 
and 
disclosures 
are 
necessary 
to 
run 
the 
hospital/clinic 
and 
make 
sure 
that 
all 
of 
our 
patients 
receive 
quality 
care. 
For 
example, 
we 
may 
use 
medical 
information 
to 
review 
the 
treatment 
and 
services 
in 
order 
to 
check 
on 
the 
performance 
of 
our 
staff 
in 
caring 
for 
you. 
We 
may 
also 
combine 
medical 
information 
about 
many 
hospital 
or 
clinic 
patients 
to 
decide 
what 
additional 
services 
we 
should 
offer, 
what 
services 
are 
not 
needed, 
and 
whether 
certain 
new 
treatments 
are 
effective. 
We 
may 
also 
disclose 
information 
to 
doctors, 
nurses, 
technicians, 
medical 
students, 
and 
other 
hospital/clinic 
personnel 
for 
review 
and 
learning 
purposes. 
We 
may 
also 
combine 
the 
medical 
information 
we 
have 
with 
medical 
information 
from 
other 
health 
care 
providers 
to 
compare 
how 
we 
are 
doing 
and 
see 
where 
we 
can 
make 
improvements 
in 
the 
care 
and 
services 
we 
offer. 
We 
may 
remove 
information 
that 
identifies 
you 
from 
this 
set 
of 
medical 
information 
so 
others 
may 
use 
it 
to 
study 
health 
care 
and 
health 
care 
delivery 
without 
learning 
who 
the 
specific 
patients 
are.</p>
<p>
<b>
Appointment

We 
may

an

<p>
<b>

We 
may

that

<p>
<b>
Fundraising 
Activities</b>: 
We 
may 
use 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
to 
contact 
you 
in 
an 
effort 
to 
raise 
money 
for 
our 
organization. 
We 
may 
disclose 
medical

to 
our 
Philanthropy 
Department 
so 
that 
they 
may 
contact 
you 
in 
raising 
money 
for 
the

However, 
we 
would 
only 
release

like 
your

number 
and 
the

<p>
<b>
Hospital 
Directory</b>: 
We 
may 
include 
certain 
limited 
information 
about 
you 
in 
the 
hospital 
directory 
while 
you 
are 
a 
patient 
at 
the 
hospital. 
This 
information 
may 
include 
your 
name, 
location 
in 
the 
hospital, 
your 
general 
condition 
(e.g., 
fair, 
stable, 
etc.) 
and 
your 
religious 
affiliation. 
This 
directory 
information 
would 
only 
be 
given 
to 
clergy, 
for 
example, 
a 
priest 
or 
rabbi. 
The 
directory 
information, 
but 
not 
your 
religious 
affiliation, 
may 
also 
be 
released 
to 
people 
who 
ask 
for 
you 
by 
name. 
This 
is 
so 
your 
family 
and 
friends 
can 
visit 
you 
in 
the 
hospital 
and 
generally 
know 
how 
you 
are 
doing.</p>
<p>
<b>
Individuals 
Involved

We

about

with 
a

is 
involved

We 
may 
also 
tell

and 
that 
you 
are 
in 
the 
hospital. 
In 
addition, 
we 
may 
disclose 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
to 
an 
entity 
assisting 
in 
a 
disaster 
relief 
effort 
so 
that 
your

about

<p>
<b>
Research</b>: 
Under 
certain 
circumstances, 
we 
may 
use 
and 
disclose 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
for 
research 
purposes. 
For 
example, 
a 
research 
project 
may 
involve 
comparing 
the 
health 
and 
recovery 
of 
all 
patients 
who 
received 
one 
medication 
to 
those 
who 
received 
another, 
for 
the 
same 
condition. 
All 
research 
projects, 
however, 
are 
subject 
to 
a 
special 
approval 
process. 
This 
process 
evaluates 
a 
proposed 
research 
project 
and 
its 
use 
of 
medical 
information, 
trying 
to 
balance 
the 
research 
needs 
with 
people’s 
need 
for 
privacy 
of 
their 
medical 
information. 
Before 
we 
use 
or 
disclose 
medical 
information 
for 
research, 
the 
project 
will 
have 
been 
approved 
through 
this 
research 
approval 
process, 
but 
we 
may, 
however, 
disclose 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
to 
people 
preparing 
to 
conduct 
a 
research 
project, 
for 
example, 
to 
help 
them 
look 
for 
patients 
with 
specific 
medical 
needs, 
so 
long 
as 
the 
medical 
information 
they 
review 
does 
not 
leave 
our 
institution.</p>
<p>
<b>
As 
Required 
By 
Law</b>: 
We 
will 
disclose 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
when 
required 
to

so 
by 
federal, 
state 
or

Example,

<p>
<b>
