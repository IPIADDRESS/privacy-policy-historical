<p>
The record of the medical care you receive at Ochsner – your 
medical information – has always been treated as personal and private. However, 
federal privacy laws that we are required to communicate to you now also govern 
this medical information. </p>
<p>
There are circumstances under which we, as the provider of your health care, are 
permitted to use and disclose your medical information:</p>
<p>
In order to provide you with medical treatment and coordinate your care, 
physicians, nurses, technicians, medical students and other personnel within the 
institution may share your medical information with one another. We may 
communicate it to individuals outside the institution who are involved in your 
medical care. We may disclose medical information about you to your insurance 
company for the purposes of reimbursement. We may review your medical 
information to make sure that your care has met our standards, and we may use it 
to educate our own staff and students. The medical information of our patients 
may also be collected, tabulated and analyzed to help us improve overall clinic 
and hospital services. We may share these statistical data with other healthcare 
institutions in order to better evaluate our own performance. As the patient, 
you are entitled to request a restriction on the medical information we use or 
disclose about you for treatment, payment, or the improvement of clinic and 
hospital operations.</p>
<p>
Appointment reminders, and communications to you about other treatments or 
services, entail the disclosure of your medical information. You may request 
that we communicate confidentially with you. If you are a patient in the 
hospital, certain limited information about you will be entered in the hospital 
directory for the benefit of your visitors. If you give us your religious 
affiliation, it may be revealed to a priest, rabbi, pastor or minister. We may 
disclose your medical information to a family member or friend who is involved 
in your care, but you may request a limit to the information we share with them. 
Under certain circumstances your medical information may be used for research 
purposes. All research projects are carefully monitored. The philanthropic 
division of our organization may use your contact information to include you in 
its fundraising efforts.</p>
<p>
Entities to which we may disclose your medical information are funeral 
directors, the coroner or medical examiner, Workers’ Compensation programs, 
public health officials, state and federal agencies charged with oversight of 
the health care system, correctional institutions, military authorities, and 
national security and intelligence agencies. In serious situations we may 
release medical information about you to law enforcement agencies. We may 
disclose medical information in the defense of a malpractice claim, or in 
response to a court or administrative order. </p>
<p>
Except under special circumstances, you are entitled to view and/or copy your 
medical record. You have the right to amend your medical information if you have 
reason to believe it is incorrect or incomplete. You are entitled to receive a 
list of those entities or individuals to whom we may have disclosed your medical 
information. You are entitled to receive a paper copy of the full Notice of 
Privacy Practices. Finally, if you feel your privacy rights have been infringed, 
you may file a complaint, without fear of penalty, with our institution or with 
the Federal Government.</p>

<br>
HOW 
WE 
MAY 
USE 
AND 
DISCLOSE 
MEDICAL 
INFORMATION 
ABOUT 
YOU</b><br>
The 
following 
categories 
describe 
several 
different 
ways 
that 
we 
use 
and 
disclose 
medical 
information. 
For 
each 
category 
of 
uses 
or 
disclosures 
we 
will 
explain 
what 
we 
mean 
and 
try 
to 
give 
some 
examples. 
Not 
every 
use 
or 
disclosure 
in 
a 
category 
will 
be 
listed. 
However, 
all 
of 
the 
ways 
we 
are 
permitted 
to 
use 
and 
disclose 
information 
will 
fall 
within 
one 
of 
the 
categories.</p>
<p>
<b>
For 
Treatment:</b> 
We 
may 
use 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
to 
provide 
you 
with 
medical 
treatment 
or 
services. 
We 
may 
disclose 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
to 
doctors, 
nurses, 
technicians, 
medical 
students, 
or 
other 
hospital/clinic 
personnel 
who 
are 
involved 
in 
taking 
care 
of 
you. 
For 
example, 
a 
doctor 
treating 
you 
for 
a 
broken 
leg 
may 
need 
to 
know 
if 
you 
have 
diabetes 
because 
diabetes 
may 
slow 
the 
healing 
process. 
In 
addition, 
the 
doctor 
may 
need 
to 
tell 
the 
dietitian 
if 
you 
have 
diabetes 
so 
that 
we 
can 
arrange 
for 
appropriate 
meals. 
Different 
departments 
of 
the 
hospital 
or 
clinic 
also 
may 
share 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
in 
order 
to 
coordinate 
the 
different 
things 
you 
need, 
such 
as 
prescriptions, 
lab 
work 
and 
x-rays. 
With 
your 
permission, 
we 
also 
may 
disclose 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
to 
individuals 
outside 
the 
facility 
who 
may 
be 
involved 
in 
your 
care.</p>
<p>
<b>
For 
Payment</b>: 
We 
may 
use 
and 
disclose 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
so 
that 
the 
treatment 
and 
services 
you 
receive 
at 
our 
facilities 
may 
be 
billed 
to, 
and 
payment 
may 
be 
collected 
from, 
an 
insurance 
company, 
a 
third 
party, 
or 
you. 
For 
example, 
we 
may 
need 
to 
give 
your 
health 
plan 
information 
about 
surgery 
you 
received 
at 
the 
hospital 
so 
your 
health 
plan 
will 
pay 
us 
or 
reimburse 
you 
for 
the 
surgery. 
We 
may 
also 
tell 
your 
health 
plan 
about 
a 
treatment 
you 
are 
going 
to 
receive 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
prior 
approval 
or 
to 
determine 
whether 
your 
plan 
will 
cover 
the 
treatment.</p>
<p>
<b>
For 
Hospital/Clinic 
Operations</b>: 
We 
may 
use 
and 
disclose 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
for 
hospital/clinic 
operations. 
These 
uses 
and 
disclosures 
are 
necessary 
to 
run 
the 
hospital/clinic 
and 
make 
sure 
that 
all 
of 
our 
patients 
receive 
quality 
care. 
For 
example, 
we 
may 
use 
medical 
information 
to 
review 
the 
treatment 
and 
services 
in 
order 
to 
check 
on 
the 
performance 
of 
our 
staff 
in 
caring 
for 
you. 
We 
may 
also 
combine 
medical 
information 
about 
many 
hospital 
or 
clinic 
patients 
to 
decide 
what 
additional 
services 
we 
should 
offer, 
what 
services 
are 
not 
needed, 
and 
whether 
certain 
new

are 
effective. 
We 
may 
also 
disclose 
information 
to 
doctors, 
nurses, 
technicians, 
medical 
students, 
and 
other 
hospital/clinic 
personnel 
for 
review 
and 
learning 
purposes. 
We

also 
combine 
the 
medical 
information 
we 
have 
with 
medical 
information 
from 
other 
health 
care 
providers 
to 
compare 
how 
we 
are 
doing 
and 
see 
where 
we 
can 
make 
improvements 
in 
the 
care 
and

we 
offer. 
We 
may 
remove 
information 
that 
identifies 
you 
from 
this 
set 
of 
medical 
information 
so 
others 
may 
use 
it 
to 
study 
health 
care 
and 
health 
care 
delivery 
without 
learning 
who 
the 
specific

are.</p>

<p>
<b>
Hospital 
Directory</b>: We may include certain limited information about you in the 
hospital directory while you are a patient at the hospital. This information may 
include your name, location in the hospital and your general condition (e.g., 
fair, stable, etc.). If you give us your religious affiliation, this information 
would be included in the hospital directory. The directory information, but not 
your religious affiliation, may also be released to people who ask for you by 
name. This is so your family and friends can visit you in the hospital and 
generally know how you are doing.</p>
<p>
<b>
Individuals 
Involved 
in 
Your

We 
may 
discuss

with

In

we 
may 
disclose 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
to 
an

assisting

<p>
<b>
Research</b>: 
Under 
certain 
circumstances, 
we 
may 
use 
and 
disclose 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
for 
research 
purposes. 
For 
example, 
a 
research 
project 
may 
involve 
comparing 
the 
health 
and 
recovery 
of 
all 
patients 
who 
received 
one 
medication 
to 
those 
who 
received 
another, 
for 
the 
same 
condition. 
All 
research 
projects, 
however, 
are 
subject 
to 
a 
special 
approval 
process. 
This 
process 
evaluates 
a 
proposed 
research 
project 
and 
its 
use 
of 
medical 
information, 
trying 
to 
balance 
the 
research 
needs 
with 
people’s 
need 
for 
privacy 
of 
their 
medical 
information. 
Before 
we 
use 
or 
disclose 
medical 
information 
for 
research, 
the 
project 
will 
have 
been 
approved 
through 
this 
research 
approval 
process, 
but 
we 
may, 
however, 
disclose 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
to 
people 
preparing 
to 
conduct 
a 
research 
project, 
for 
example, 
to 
help 
them 
look 
for 
patients 
with 
specific 
medical 
needs, 
so 
long 
as 
the 
medical 
information 
they 
review 
does 
not 
leave 
our 
institution.</p>
<p>
<b>
As 
Required 
By 
Law</b>: 
We 
will 
disclose 
medical 
information 
about 
you 
when 
required 
to 
do 
so 
by 
federal, 
state 
or 
local 
law. 
Example,

about

deaths.</p>
<p>
<b>
