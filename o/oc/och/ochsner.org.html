</p><h4>Patient Privacy Statement</h4>
<p>
Notice of Privacy Practices
<br>
The record of the medical care you receive at Ochsner Clinic Foundation – your medical information – has always been treated as personal and private. However, federal privacy laws that we are required to communicate to you now also govern this medical information.
</p>
<p>
There are circumstances under which we, as the provider of your health care, are permitted to use and disclose your medical information:
</p>
<p>
In order to provide you with medical treatment and coordinate your care, physicians, nurses, technicians, medical students and other personnel within the institution may share your medical information with one another. We may communicate it to individuals outside the institution who are involved in your medical care. We may disclose medical information about you to your insurance company for the purposes of reimbursement. We may review your medical information to make sure that your care has met our standards, and we may use it to educate our own staff and students. The medical information of our patients may also be collected, tabulated and analyzed to help us improve overall clinic and hospital services. We may share these statistical data with other healthcare institutions in order to better evaluate our own performance. As the patient, you are entitled to request a restriction on the medical information we use or disclose about you for treatment, payment, or the improvement of clinic and hospital operations.
</p>
<p>
Appointment reminders, and communications to you about other treatments or services, entail the disclosure of your medical information. You may request that we communicate confidentially with you. If you are a patient in the hospital, certain limited information about you will be entered in the hospital directory for the benefit of your visitors. If you give us your religious affiliation, it may be revealed to a priest, rabbi, pastor or minister. We may disclose your medical information to a family member or friend who is involved in your care, but you may request a limit to the information we share with them. Under certain circumstances your medical information may be used for research purposes. All research projects are carefully monitored. The philanthropic division of our organization may use your contact information to include you in its fundraising efforts.
</p>
<p>
Entities to which we may disclose your medical information are funeral directors, the coroner or medical examiner, Workers’ Compensation programs, public health officials, state and federal agencies charged with oversight of the health care system, correctional institutions, military authorities, and national security and intelligence agencies. In serious situations we may release medical information about you to law enforcement agencies. We may disclose medical information in the defense of a malpractice claim, or in response to a court or administrative order.
</p>
<p>
Except under special circumstances, you are entitled to view and/or copy your medical record. You have the right to amend your medical information if you have reason to believe it is incorrect or incomplete. You are entitled to receive a list of those entities or individuals to whom we may have disclosed your medical information. You are entitled to receive a paper copy of the full Notice of Privacy Practices. Finally, if you feel your privacy rights have been infringed, you may file a complaint, without fear of penalty, with our institution or with the Federal Government.

HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT
<br>
NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES
<br>
Version: Number 2
<br>
Effective Date: December 16, 2002
</p>
<p>
THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN OBTAIN ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions about this notice, please call 1-866-842-7099 and ask to speak with the Patient Relations Department.
</p>
<p>
OUR PLEDGE REGARDING MEDICAL INFORMATION
<br>
We understand that medical information about you and your health is personal. We are committed to protecting medical information about you. We create a record of the care and services you receive at the hospital and clinic. We need this record to provide you with quality care and to comply with certain legal requirements. This notice applies to all of the records of your care generated in the hospital and clinic, whether made by hospital/clinic personnel or your treating doctor.
</p>
<p>
This notice will tell you about the ways in which we may use and disclose medical information about you. We also describe your rights and certain obligations we have regarding the use and disclosure of medical information.
</p>
<p>
We are required by law to
<br>
</p><ul>
<li>Make sure that medical information that identifies you is kept private;</li>
<li>Give you this notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to medical information about you; and</li>
<li>Follow the terms of the notice that is currently in effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>
HOW WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU
<br>
The following categories describe several different ways that we use and disclose medical information. For each category of uses or disclosures we will explain what we mean and try to give some examples. Not every use or disclosure in a category will be listed. However, all of the ways we are permitted to use and disclose information will fall within one of the categories.
</p>
<p>
For Treatment: We may use medical information about you to provide you with medical treatment or services. We may disclose medical information about you to doctors, nurses, technicians, medical students, or other hospital/clinic personnel who are involved in taking care of you. For example, a doctor treating you for a broken leg may need to know if you have diabetes because diabetes may slow the healing process. In addition, the doctor may need to tell the dietitian if you have diabetes so that we can arrange for appropriate meals. Different departments of the hospital or clinic also may share medical information about you in order to coordinate the different things you need, such as prescriptions, lab work and x-rays. With your permission, we also may disclose medical information about you to individuals outside the facility who may be involved in your care.
</p>
<p>
For Payment: We may use and disclose medical information about you so that the treatment and services you receive at our facilities may be billed to, and payment may be collected from, an insurance company, a third party, or you. For example, we may need to give your health plan information about surgery you received at the hospital so your health plan will pay us or reimburse you for the surgery. We may also tell your health plan about a treatment you are going to receive in order to obtain prior approval or to determine whether your plan will cover the treatment.
</p>
<p>
For Hospital/Clinic Operations: We may use and disclose medical information about you for hospital/clinic operations. These uses and disclosures are necessary to run the hospital/clinic and make sure that all of our patients receive quality care. For example, we may use medical information to review the treatment and services in order to check on the performance of our staff in caring for you. We may also combine medical information about many hospital or clinic patients to decide what additional services we should offer, what services are not needed, and whether certain new treatments are effective. We may also disclose information to doctors, nurses, technicians, medical students, and other hospital/clinic personnel for review and learning purposes. We may also combine the medical information we have with medical information from other health care providers to compare how we are doing and see where we can make improvements in the care and services we offer. We may remove information that identifies you from this set of medical information so others may use it to study health care and health care delivery without learning who the specific patients are.
</p>
<p>
Appointment Reminders: We may use and disclose medical information to contact you as a reminder that you have an appointment for treatment or medical care at the facility.
</p>
<p>
Treatment Alternatives: We may use and disclose medical information to tell you about or recommend possible treatment options or alternatives that may be of interest to you.
</p>
<p>
Health Related Benefits and Services: We may use and disclose medical information to tell you about health-related benefits or services that may be of interest to you.
</p>
<p>
Fundraising Activities: We may use medical information about you to contact you in an effort to raise money for our organization. We may disclose medical information to our Philanthropy Department so that they may contact you in raising money for the hospital and clinic. However, we would only release contact information, like your name, address and phone number and the dates you received treatment or services.
</p>
<p>
Hospital Directory: We may include certain limited information about you in the hospital directory while you are a patient at the hospital. This information may include your name, location in the hospital and your general condition (e.g., fair, stable, etc.). If you give us your religious affiliation, this information would be included in the hospital directory. The directory information, but not your religious affiliation, may also be released to people who ask for you by name. This is so your family and friends can visit you in the hospital and generally know how you are doing.
</p>
<p>
Individuals Involved in Your Care: We may discuss medical information about you with a friend or family member who is involved in your medical care. We may also tell your family or friends your condition and that you are in the hospital. In addition, we may disclose medical information about you to an entity assisting in a disaster relief effort so that your family can be notified about your condition, status and location.
</p>
<p>
Research: Under certain circumstances, we may use and disclose medical information about you for research purposes. For example, a research project may involve comparing the health and recovery of all patients who received one medication to those who received another, for the same condition. All research projects, however, are subject to a special approval process. This process evaluates a proposed research project and its use of medical information, trying to balance the research needs with people’s need for privacy of their medical information. Before we use or disclose medical information for research, the project will have been approved through this research approval process, but we may, however, disclose medical information about you to people preparing to conduct a research project, for example, to help them look for patients with specific medical needs, so long as the medical information they review does not leave our institution.
</p>
<p>
As Required By Law: We will disclose medical information about you when required to do so by federal, state or local law. Example, law about reporting deaths.
</p>
<p>
To Avert a Serious Threat to Health or Safety: We may use and disclose medical information about you when necessary to prevent a serious threat to your health and safety or the health and safety of the public or another person. Any disclosure, however, would only be to someone able to help prevent the threat.
</p>
<p>
SPECIAL SITUATIONS

</ul>
<p>
Health Oversight Activities: We may disclose medical information to a health oversight agency for activities authorized by law. These oversight activities include, for example, audits, investigations, inspections, and licensure. These activities are necessary for the government to monitor the health care system, government programs, and compliance with civil right laws.
</p>
<p>
Lawsuits and Disputes: If you are involved in a lawsuit or a dispute, we may disclose medical information about you in response to a court or administrative order or in the defense of a malpractice claim arising out of care provided by us. We may disclose medical information about you in response to a subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process by someone else involved in the dispute.
</p>
<p>
Coroner, Medical Examiners and Funeral Directors: We may release medical information to a coroner or medical examiner. This may be necessary, for example, to identity a deceased person or determine the cause of death. We may also release medical information about patients of the hospital to funeral directors as necessary to enable them to carry out their duties.
</p>

</p>

Inmates: If you are an inmate of a correctional institution or under the custody of a law enforcement official, we may release medical information about you to the correctional institution or law enforcement official. This release would be if necessary (1) for the institution to provide you with health care; (2) to protect your health and safety or the health and safety of others; or (3) the safety and security of the correctional institution.
