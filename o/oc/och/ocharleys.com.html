    <h2>1. OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to O'Charley's, LLC. ("O'Charley's"). To protect the privacy of the visitors
    ("you") to the O'Charley's website at <a href="http://www.Ocharleys.com">ocharleys.com</a>, O'Charley's
    ("we/us")
    has developed this Privacy Policy ("Policy") explaining our online information practices and the choices
    you can make about the way your information is collected and used. Please read below for more specific
    information on the type of
    information that we collect and how we use it.</p>
    </li>
    <li id="Information" class="clearfix">
    <h2>2. TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
    <p>This section of our Policy describes in detail the type of information that we collect. We collect
    information from you in various ways when you access or use various services (the
    “Services”), our websites and/or our mobile applications
    (collectively, the “Properties”). </p>
    <p>Much of the personal information collected through the Properties is voluntarily submitted by you. For
    example:
    </p>
    <ul class="voluntary-information">
        <li><strong>Account Information.</strong> We may collect personal information from you, such as your
        first and last name, email address, telephone number, date of birth, zip code, mailing address, and
        password or other unique identifier, when you create
        an account for one of our programs, e.g., our O’Club or other loyalty or rewards program
        ("Account").
        </li>
        <li><strong>Location Information.</strong> If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile
        device to send us your location or by entering your city, state and/or zip code information), we may
        collect information about your location and use
        that information to provide you with location-based information, such as the location of our
        restaurants near you. If you want to deactivate this feature, you can deactivate location services
        on your mobile device.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Store Preference Information.</strong> Our online order services may allow you to store
        preferences such as your location, recent orders and favorite menu items in order to make it more
        convenient for you to place additional orders in the
        future.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Online Ordering Information.</strong> When you order our Services online (e.g., menu items
        or gift cards), we will collect information to complete the transaction, including potentially: your
        name; email address; billing, shipping and delivery
        addresses; and payment information such as credit card number. We store this information (excluding
        credit card numbers) in order to make it easier for you to place orders in the future. We also
        collect information regarding the items
        you place in a basket and purchase, your time of visit and preferred store locations.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Information.</strong> If you provide us feedback or contact us by email, we may
        collect your name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to
        send you a reply.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sweepstakes/Contests.</strong> Periodically, we will sponsor sweepstakes or contests. Links
        to those sweepstakes or contests may be included on our website. Various types of information may be
        collected as part of the sweepstakes or contests,
        including, for example, your name, email address and phone number. The specific rules posted with
        the particular sweepstakes or contests will apply to entrants and will supersede the privacy policy
        and terms and conditions posted on
        our websites.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Contact Us Link.</strong> If you choose to contact us, we may collect your name, email
        address, postal address, telephone number, and the contents of your message. We use the information
        obtained when you contact us through the "Contact
        Us" link to process and respond to your suggestion or customer service request. We may respond to
        you by phone, email, or postal mail, depending on the information you choose to submit. We also will
        use this information to improve
        our Services. We also reserve the right to use your name and comments in our promotional material.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Application for Employment Information.</strong> If you would like to become one or our
        employees, you may choose to submit an employment application online through the "Careers" link. The
        pages listing employment opportunities are operated
        by a third party partner. When you visit those pages, you are visiting a separate website and are
        subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policy of that site. Your application information,
        once delivered to us, is used only
        to process your employment request, which includes corresponding with you to make arrangements for
        your association with us or to notify you of the results of our review of your application. The
        information, which will be protected
        in accordance with our internal policies, may be printed and stored, and administrative personnel
        may review the information.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Other Information.</strong> We also collect other types of personal information that you
        provide to us voluntarily, such as any information requested by us if you contact us by email
        regarding support for our Services.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to information you provide us voluntarily, we collect certain information from you
    automatically when you access and use our Properties. For example:</p>
    <ul class="collected-information">
        <li><strong>Information Collected by Servers.</strong> Our servers (which may be hosted by a third party
        service provider) collect information from you, including the referring/exit pages, your browser
        type, domain name, date/time stamp for your visit
        and your Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer or
        device when you use the Internet). We use this information for a variety of reasons, including to
        improve our Services to you, analyze
        trends and purchasing habits, administer the Properties and monitor for fraudulent activities.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cookies.</strong> We use cookies to collect information. A cookie is a small removable data
        file that is stored by your web browser on your computer. Cookies allow you to place an order on our
        websites and allow us to enhance and personalize
        your online browsing and shopping experience. For example, we use cookies to remember the items in
        your shopping cart and to recognize you when you return to our websites. You can choose to have your
        computer warn you each time a cookie
        is being sent or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (e.g.,
        Safari, Chrome or Internet Explorer) settings. If you turn cookies off, you will not have access to
        many features that make our websites
        more efficient and some of our Services will not function properly.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mobile Services.</strong> We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile
        device if you have downloaded an application of ours. We may use this information to help us deliver
        relevant information to you. Examples may include
        your geographic location, how you use the application(s), and information about the type of device
        you use.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Third Party Analytics.</strong> We may use third party service providers to help analyze how
        users use the Properties. These providers typically use cookies to collect information such as how
        often users visit a website, what pages they
        visit and what other sites they used prior to coming to a site. We use this information to improve
        our Properties.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Third Party Links and Websites.</strong> We may from time to time contract with advertisers
        or other third parties who place information, advertisements, or other promotional material or links
        on our websites. If you click on an advertisement
        or other link provided by a third party and leave our websites, whether through a link or through
        visiting another website framed within our sites, you are subject to the terms and conditions and
        privacy policies of these advertisers
        or other third parties. We do not have responsibility for or access to the information collected by
        these third parties.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="InformationUse" class="clearfix">
    <h2>3. How We Use Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>This section of our Policy describes in detail how we use the information that we collect. We describe
    below both how we use the information and with whom we share it.</p>
    <p><strong>How We Use Information</strong></p>
    <p>Generally, we use the information to respond to your requests as submitted through the Properties, to
    provide you the Services you request, or to assist us in serving your better. For example, we use the
    information to:</p>
    <ul class="example-information-use">
        <li>Facilitate the creation of and secure your Account;</li>
        <li>Identify you as a user in our system;</li>
        <li>Provide improved administration of our websites and other Properties;</li>
        <li>Provide the Services, including, for example, to process, deliver and bill you for your menu item or
        gift card order;</li>
        <li>Improve the quality of experience when you interact with our websites, Services or other Properties;
        </li>
        <li>Send you a welcome e-mail to verify ownership of the e-mail address provided when your Account was
        created;
        </li>
        <li>Respond to your inquiries related to employment opportunities or other requests;</li>
        <li>Solicit your feedback; and</li>
        <li>Send push notifications, text messages, emails, newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional
        materials related to our Services and for other marketing purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may create anonymous information records from personal information by excluding information (such as
    your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you. We may use this anonymous
    information to analyze request patterns
    and usage patterns so that we may enhance our Services. We reserve the right to use and disclose
    anonymous information to third parties in its discretion.</p>
    <p><strong>Who May Receive Information</strong></p>
    <p>We may share the information we collect with our affiliated companies and with third parties that assist
    us with our Services and other Properties. These companies may assist us in such activities as
    processing menu orders, conducting sweepstakes
    and contests, promoting our Services through marketing and advertising, conducting quality assurance
    testing, providing technical support, running customer loyalty or rewards programs and otherwise
    improving our third party service providers
    and other Properties.
    </p>
    <p>For example, we use certain services provided by Punchh, Inc. (“Punchh”) to run a customer
    loyalty program and present special offers on our Properties. As part of these services, certain
    personal information you provide may be
    shared with Punchh (including, without limitation, your name, email address, payment information and/or
    information regarding the purchases you make with us). In connection with such services, Punchh may use
    this information as permitted
    by Punchh’s privacy policy (available at:
    <a href="https://punchh.com/privacy_policy">https://punchh.com/privacy_policy</a>).
    </p>
    <p>We also may share this information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing,
    acquisition or dissolution transaction involving the sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all
    or a portion of our business or assets.
    In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, your information may also be transferred as
    a business asset. If our company, business or assets are acquired by another company, that company will
    possess the information collected
    by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in
    this Policy.</p>
    <p>We further may share this information with law enforcement officials, or when we believe that we must do
    so to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our rights, or may be
    causing injury to or interfering
    with our or another's rights or property.</p>
    <p>We further may share this information if we believe that disclosure is necessary: (a) to comply with
    relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; (b) to protect and defend our rights
    or property or the rights or property
    of others; (c) in connection with a legal investigation; and/or (d) to investigate or assist in
    preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Policy or other terms of use.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li id="DataCommitment" class="clearfix">
    <h2>4. OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY</h2>
    <p>The security of your personal information is important to us and so we employ reasonable and appropriate
    technical and organizational security procedures and processes designed to help protect against loss,
    misuse, and alteration of the personal
    information that we collect and process through the Properties. We further follow applicable laws and
    requirements to protect your information processed through the Properties. However, we unfortunately
    cannot guarantee 100% security for
    data collected or processed through the Properties. As a result, we do not ensure, warrant or guarantee
    the security or integrity of such information. </p>

    <li id="CaliforniaNotice" class="clearfix">
    <h2>5. SPECIAL NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS</h2>
    <p>California residents may request a list of certain third parties, if any, to which we have disclosed
    personally identifiable information about you for their own direct marketing purposes. You may make one
    request per calendar year. In your
    request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California
    address for your response. To request this information, please contact us using the
