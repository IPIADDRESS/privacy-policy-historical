    <h2>1. OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to O'Charley's, LLC. ("O'Charley's"). To protect the privacy of the visitors
    ("you") to the O'Charley's website at <a href="http://www.Ocharleys.com">ocharleys.com</a>, O'Charley's
    ("we/us") has developed this Privacy Policy ("Policy") explaining our online information practices and
    the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. Please read below for
    more specific information on the type of information that we collect and how we use it.</p>
    </li>
    <li id="Information" class="clearfix">
    <h2>2. TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
    <p>This section of our Policy describes in detail the type of information that we collect. We collect
    information from you in various ways when you access or use various services (the “Services”), our
    websites and/or our mobile applications (collectively, the “Properties”). </p>
    <p>Much of the personal information collected through the Properties is voluntarily submitted by you. For
    example:</p>
    <ul class="voluntary-information">
        <li>
        <strong>Account Information.</strong> We may collect personal information from you, such as your first
        and last name, email address, telephone number, date of birth, zip code, mailing address, and
        password or other unique identifier, when you create an account for one of our programs, e.g.,
        our O’Club or other loyalty or rewards program ("Account").
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Location Information.</strong> If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device
        to send us your location or by entering your city, state and/or zip code information), we may
        collect information about your location and use that information to provide you with
        location-based information, such as the location of our restaurants near you. If you want to
        deactivate this feature, you can deactivate location services on your mobile device.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Store Preference Information.</strong> Our online order services may allow you to store
        preferences such as your location, recent orders and favorite menu items in order to make it
        more convenient for you to place additional orders in the future.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Online Ordering Information.</strong> When you order our Services online (e.g., menu items or
        gift cards), we will collect information to complete the transaction, including potentially:
        your name; email address; billing, shipping and delivery addresses; and payment information
        such as credit card number. We store this information (excluding credit card numbers) in order
        to make it easier for you to place orders in the future. We also collect information regarding
        the items you place in a basket and purchase, your time of visit and preferred store locations.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Feedback Information.</strong> If you provide us feedback or contact us by email, we may collect
        your name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to
        send you a reply.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Sweepstakes/Contests.</strong> Periodically, we will sponsor sweepstakes or contests. Links to
        those sweepstakes or contests may be included on our website. Various types of information may
        be collected as part of the sweepstakes or contests, including, for example, your name, email
        address and phone number. The specific rules posted with the particular sweepstakes or contests
        will apply to entrants and will supersede the privacy policy and terms and conditions posted on
        our websites.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Contact Us Link.</strong> If you choose to contact us, we may collect your name, email address,
        postal address, telephone number, and the contents of your message. We use the information
        obtained when you contact us through the "Contact Us" link to process and respond to your
        suggestion or customer service request. We may respond to you by phone, email, or postal mail,
        depending on the information you choose to submit. We also will use this information to improve
        our Services. We also reserve the right to use your name and comments in our promotional
        material.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Application for Employment Information.</strong> If you would like to become one or our
        employees, you may choose to submit an employment application online through the "Careers"
        link. The pages listing employment opportunities are operated by a third party partner. When
        you visit those pages, you are visiting a separate website and are subject to the terms and
        conditions and privacy policy of that site. Your application information, once delivered to us,
        is used only to process your employment request, which includes corresponding with you to make
        arrangements for your association with us or to notify you of the results of our review of your
        application. The information, which will be protected in accordance with our internal policies,
        may be printed and stored, and administrative personnel may review the information.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Other Information.</strong> We also collect other types of personal information that you provide
        to us voluntarily, such as any information requested by us if you contact us by email regarding
        support for our Services.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to information you provide us voluntarily, we collect certain information from you
    automatically when you access and use our Properties. For example:</p>
    <ul class="collected-information">
        <li>
        <strong>Information Collected by Servers.</strong> Our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service
        provider) collect information from you, including the referring/exit pages, your browser type,
        domain name, date/time stamp for your visit and your Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that
        is automatically assigned to your computer or device when you use the Internet). We use this
        information for a variety of reasons, including to improve our Services to you, analyze trends and
        purchasing habits, administer the Properties and monitor for fraudulent activities.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Cookies.</strong> We use cookies to collect information. A cookie is a small removable data file that
        is stored by your web browser on your computer. Cookies allow you to place an order on our websites
        and allow us to enhance and personalize your online browsing and shopping experience. For example,
        we use cookies to remember the items in your shopping cart and to recognize you when you return to
        our websites. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent or you
        can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (e.g., Safari, Chrome or
        Internet Explorer) settings. If you turn cookies off, you will not have access to many features
        that make our websites more efficient and some of our Services will not function properly.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Mobile Services.</strong> We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you

        <strong>Third Party Analytics.</strong> We may use third party service providers to help analyze how users
        use the Properties. These providers typically use cookies to collect information such as how often
        users visit a website, what pages they visit and what other sites they used prior to coming to a

    <h2>3. How We Use Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>This section of our Policy describes in detail how we use the information that we collect. We describe
    below both how we use the information and with whom we share it.</p>
    <p><strong>How We Use Information</strong></p>
    <p>Generally, we use the information to respond to your requests as submitted through the Properties, to
    provide you the Services you request, or to assist us in serving your better. For example, we use the
    information to:</p>
    <ul class="example-information-use">
        <li>Facilitate the creation of and secure your Account;</li>
        <li>Identify you as a user in our system;</li>
        <li>Provide improved administration of our websites and other Properties;</li>
        <li>Provide the Services, including, for example, to process, deliver and bill you for your menu item
        or gift card order;</li>
        <li>Improve the quality of experience when you interact with our websites, Services or other
        Properties;</li>
        <li>Send you a welcome e-mail to verify ownership of the e-mail address provided when your Account was
        created;</li>
        <li>Respond to your inquiries related to employment opportunities or other requests;</li>
        <li>Solicit your feedback; and</li>
        <li>Send push notifications, text messages, emails, newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional
        materials related to our Services and for other marketing purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may create anonymous information records from personal information by excluding information (such as
    your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you. We may use this anonymous
    information to analyze request patterns and usage patterns so that we may enhance our Services. We
    reserve the right to use and disclose anonymous information to third parties in its discretion.</p>
    <p><strong>Who May Receive Information</strong></p>
    <p>We may share the information we collect with our affiliated companies and with third parties that assist
    us with our Services and other Properties. These companies may assist us in such activities as
    processing menu orders, conducting sweepstakes and contests, promoting our Services through marketing
    and advertising, conducting quality assurance testing, providing technical support, running customer
    loyalty or rewards programs and otherwise improving our third party service providers and other
    Properties.</p>
    <p>For example, we use certain services provided by Punchh, Inc. (“Punchh”) to run a customer loyalty
    program
    and present special offers on our Properties. As part of these services, certain personal information
    you provide may be shared with Punchh (including, without limitation, your name, email address, payment
    information and/or information regarding the purchases you make with us). In connection with such
    services,
    Punchh may use this information as permitted by Punchh’s privacy policy (available at:
    <a href="https://punchh.com/privacy_policy">https://punchh.com/privacy_policy</a>).
    </p>
    <p>We also may share this information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing,
    acquisition
    or dissolution transaction involving the sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion
    of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, your information
    may also be transferred as a business asset. If our company, business or assets are acquired by another
    company, that company will possess the information collected by us and it will assume the rights and
    obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Policy.</p>
    <p>We further may share this information with law enforcement officials, or when we believe that we must do
    so to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our rights, or may
    be causing injury to or interfering with our or another's rights or property.</p>
    <p>We further may share this information if we believe that disclosure is necessary: (a) to comply with
    relevant
    laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; (b) to protect and defend our rights or
    property
    or the rights or property of others; (c) in connection with a legal investigation; and/or (d) to
    investigate
    or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Policy or other terms of
    use.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li id="DataCommitment" class="clearfix">
    <h2>4. OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY</h2>
    <p>The security of your personal information is important to us and so we employ reasonable and appropriate
    technical and organizational security procedures and processes designed to help protect against loss,
    misuse, and alteration of the personal information that we collect and process through the Properties.
    We further follow applicable laws and requirements to protect your information processed through
    the Properties. However, we unfortunately cannot guarantee 100% security for data collected or
    processed
    through the Properties. As a result, we do not ensure, warrant or guarantee the security or integrity
    of such information. </p>

    SNS that we support, and then entering your SNS login credentials. In this case, we may receive
    information from Facebook or another SNS to make it easier for you to create an Account on
    the Properties and show our relevant content from your Facebook and SNS friends. Once you
    register on the Properties and connect with Facebook or another SNS, you will be able to
    post recent activity back to Facebook or the other SNS. Any information that we collect from
    your Facebook or other SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have with that
    SNS, so please consult the SNS’s privacy and data practices. You acknowledge and agree that
    you are solely responsible for your use of these third party SNSs and that it is your responsibility
    to review the terms of use and privacy policy of such SNSs. We and our affiliates and third
    party providers will not be liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such SNSs; (ii)
    the content, products or services on or availability of such SNSs; or (iii) your use of any
    such SNSs.</p>
