Ltd. ( “oCricket”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its  customers, visitors, and other users of the oCricket website (“the  Site”). We created this Website Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to  give you confidence as you visit and use the Site, and to demonstrate  our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of  privacy. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to  any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each  of which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and  policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact us at help@ocricket.com.<br><br><strong>Information Collection Practices</strong><br><strong><br>
Types of Information Collected</strong><br><br>
(a) Traffic Data Collected. We automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit our Site:<br>
(1) IP addresses;<br>
(2) domain servers;<br>
(3) types of computers accessing the Site; and<br>
(4)  types of web browsers used to access the Site (collectively “Traffic  Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally  identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving  your experience on the Site. We also use “cookies” to customize content  specific to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same  advertisement repeatedly, and to store your password so you do not have  to re-enter it each time you visit the Site. The information stored in  Traffic Data cookies is not linked to any Personal Information. Some of  our business partners use cookies on our site. We have no access to or  control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of  cookies by oCricket.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by  any third party. <br><br>
(b) Personal Information Collected. In order  for you to access certain premium, services and to purchase products  that we offer via the Site, we require you to provide us with certain  information that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”).  Personal Information includes the following categories of information:<br>
(1) Contact Data (such as your name, mailing address, and e-mail address);<br>
(2) Financial Data (such as your account or credit card number); and<br>
(3)  Demographic Data (such as your zip code, and age). If you communicate  with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin  boards, or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, or  contest entries, any information provided in such communication may be  collected as Personal Information. <br><br><strong>Uses of Information Collected</strong><br><br>
(a)  oCricket USE OF INFORMATION. We use Contact Data to send you  information about oCricket, our products or services, promotional  material from some of our partners, or to contact you when necessary.  You may opt-out of receiving such communication at any time by changing  your Notification Preferences on your My Account/Notifications page. We  use your Demographic Data to customize and tailor your experience on  the Site, displaying content that we think you might be interested in  and according to your preferences. When you log in to your account at  oCricket.com, we link the information we store in your log in session  cookie to Personal Information. Your Contact Data (e-mail address) is  required for the proper functioning of certain content (e.g., our  cricket games). We DO NOT store any personally identifiable data in our  cookies. <br><br>
(b) Sharing of Personal Information. We share certain  categories of information we collect from you in the ways described in  this Privacy Policy. We share Demographic Data with advertisers and  other third parties only on an aggregate (i.e.,  non-personally-identifiable) basis. We may share Contact Data and  Financial Data with our business partners who assist us by performing  core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfilment, or data storage  and security) related to our operation of the Site. Those business  partners have all agreed to uphold the same standards of security and  confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy,  and they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal Information  to carry out their specific business obligations to oCricket. We do not  share, sell, rent or trade Personal Information with third parties for  their promotional purposes. <br><br>
You will be given a choice to opt  out of sharing your Personal Information with our business partners at  the point of collection, but please understand that this will likely  limit or prevent you from using the features and services we offer on  the Site. In addition, we maintain a procedure for you to review and  request changes to your Personal Information; this procedure is  described below. <br><br>
(c) User Choice/Opt-out Regarding Collection,  Use, and Distribution of Personal Information. You may choose not to  provide us with any Personal Information. In such an event, you can  still access and use much of the Site; however you will not be able to  access and use those portions of the Site that require your Personal  Information (e.g, user registration).

The  security of your personal information is important to us. oCricket uses  industry-standard 128-bit SSL encryption to protect your information.

We  follow accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information  submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of  electronic storage, is perfectly secure. Therefore, while we strive to  use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information,  we cannot guarantee, and you cannot expect, its absolute security. <br><br>
