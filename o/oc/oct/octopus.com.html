      <p><b>Octopus privacy statement<br>
        </b>Octopus respects the privacy of its users and the security of the 
        data that users provide.&nbsp; This privacy statement explains what type 
        of information we collect from our users, what we do with that information, 
        and how users can update and control the use of information provided to 
        Octopus.&nbsp; This policy may change in the future without further notice.&nbsp; 
        Users are responsible for regularly reviewing this policy so please be 
        sure to check back frequently.</p>
      <p><b>What type of information do we collect?<br>
        </b>Octopus’ corporate site document download registration and the 
        Octopus Personal Edition registration require users to give us their contact 
        information (name, e-mail address, and phone number) and company information 
        (company name and address). We use the knowledge gained to modify products 
        and services to meet users’ needs, the contact information for marketing 
        and sales purposes, and the site registration form to personalize the 
        user’s Octopus Web experience. </p>
      <p>Octopus also captures information from browser cookies. Cookies are files 
        written to a user’s disk and read by the http server program so that the 
        server program knows if the user has previously visited our site. This 
        knowledge allows us to analyze our site, see what is successful or useful, 
        and modify our site based on common needs.</p>
      <p>We collect and store various kinds of personally identifying information 
        ("Personal Information") from users for both the Octopus Personal 
        Edition as well as on www.octopus.com for services such as unlimited use 
        of the free Personal Edition as well as for downloads of whitepapers and 
        data sheets (the "Service") on www.octopus.com. In addition 
        to the information we specifically ask users to provide, we may also collect 
        certain categories of information automatically as part of the operations 
        of this Service, such as the Internet Protocol address of the user’s originating 
        Internet Service Provider, or the type of browser the user is are using.&nbsp; 
        We also collect aggregate and individual information about the use of 
        our Service, including which pages are most frequently visited, how many 
        users visit the site daily, how long they stay on each page, and the types 
        of content they select and view.&nbsp; A brief description of the information 
        that we collect follows:</p>
      <p><b>IP address </b>– The user’s IP address is a number that is assigned 
        to the user’s computer by the Internet Service Provider each time the 
        user logs onto the Internet. The IP address enables sites that the user 
        may visit to send data such as the Web page to the user’s computer.&nbsp; 
        IP addresses are automatically gathered by our Web server and help us 
        diagnose problems with our server, ultimately helping us administer the 
        site.</p>
      <p><b>"Referrer"</b> - A "referrer" is the information 
        sent by the user’s Web browser that references the Web URL the user linked 
        from, and is automatically gathered by our Web server.&nbsp; This information 
        may be used to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide 
        information tailored to users’ interests.</p>
      <p><b>Environment variables</b> - Environment variables are things such 
        as time, Web browser type, operating system or platform, and CPU speed. 
        This information is generally used to ensure compatibility of our software 
        with users’ systems and to identify broad demographic statistics.</p>
      <p><b>Cookies</b> - Cookies are tiny text files stored on the customer's 
        computer by the Web server and can be read only by the Web server that 
        placed the file.&nbsp; Users can set their browser to notify them when 
        they receive a cookie, giving them the opportunity to decide whether or 
        not to accept it.&nbsp; Cookies are used for, among other things, remembering 
        the state of the site when users have left it so that when the user returns, 
        we can bring the user back into the same environment.&nbsp; If the user 
        chooses not to accept cookies, the user will still be able to use portions 
        of the site, but the user experience will be significantly altered and 
        some features might not function. Octopus uses <a href="http://www.websidestory.com/" target="new" class="pressLink">WebSideStory, 
        Inc.</a> to accumulate and report anonymous, aggregate, statistical information 
        that helps us understand and analyze the Web site experience of our visitors. 
        This information is stored in a cookie on your computer's hard drive. 
        However, none of this information is personally identifiable and we only 
        share this information in the aggregate, reflecting overall Web site or 
        Internet usage trends. Please visit the <a href="http://www.websidestory.com/cgi-bin/wss.cgi?privacy&amp;privacy&amp;index" target="new" class="pressLink">WebSideStory 
        Privacy Center</a>. </p>
      <p><b>GUIDs</b> - A Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) is an alphanumeric 
        identifier.&nbsp; A GUID is used to indicate a unique installation of 
        software and is found in many popular software applications.&nbsp; GUIDs 
        may be used for statistical purposes or to personalize the content, services, 
        and promotions offered to the user on this site, thereby enhancing the 
        overall user experience.&nbsp; GUIDs may also be used to uniquely identify 
        users of this site when they access it.</p>
      <p><b>Operating metrics </b>- Information regarding the usage of the Software 
        by users in aggregate such as the average amount of time spent on pages 
        or click-throughs sent.&nbsp; We may use the information to research users’ 
        habits in aggregate and understand the popularity and effectiveness of 
        the services we offer so we can improve them in the future.&nbsp; We may 
        also use the information on an individual basis to provide helpful tips 
        or special offers (including paid advertising) that are targeted to our 
        users.</p>
      <p><b>E-mail</b> - We only collect users’ e-mail address during the sign 
        up process.&nbsp; If the user enters an e-mail for any other operation 
        (such as sending a View) it is for the use of that function only and we 
        will not store it.</p>
      <p>In addition, Octopus will maintain the Octopus Views, communications 
        or other content that are saved or transmitted by our users through our 
        servers.&nbsp; It is our policy not to disclose the content of private 
        communications except as we believe necessary to comply with the law or 
        legal process or government inquiry.</p>
      <p>The user acknowledges that material available in publicly accessible 
        areas of Octopus constitute public and not private communications and 
        may be read by others without the user’s knowledge.&nbsp; Users should 
        always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information 
        about themselves or their children on or throughout the Octopus site.</p>
      <p><b>How do we use the information we collect?<br>
        </b>We use user contact information from the registration form to send 
        the user information about our company. The user’s contact information 
        is also used to contact the user when necessary. Users may opt-out of 
        receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. </p>
      <p>Use of browser cookies allows Octopus to provide a better, more relevant, 
        user experience, as well as to regulate Web site functions such as the 
        timing, frequency, and type of advertising. Cookies may also be used to 
        automate entry into password protected parts of Octopus’ site, or to automate 
        data entry functions, so that users don't have to reenter data with each 
        visit.</p>
      <p><b>With whom do we share information?<br>
        </b>Except as provided in this Privacy Statement and in our <a href="http://www.octopus.com/company/terms.htm" class="pressLink">Terms of Service</a>, 
        we will not share users’ personal information with any third party without 
        their consent.&nbsp; We may provide aggregate information about our users, 
        Web site traffic, or related activity for purposes of marketing or promotion.</p>
      </font> <font class="FontNS"> 
      <p>We may disclose information about our users if we have a good faith belief 
        that we are required to do so by law or legal process, to respond to claims, 
        or to protect the rights, property or safety of Octopus or others.</p>
      <p>Other companies that provide services on or through our Web site, or 
        that advertise or link on our Web site, may use cookies or collect other 
        information about our users when they go to their site.&nbsp; Octopus 
        does not control the collection or use of information by these companies.&nbsp; 
        Users should contact these companies directly if they have any questions 
        about their collection or use of information about themselves.</p>
      <p><b>How is user information protected?<br>
        </b>The accuracy and security of all user information is important to 
        Octopus. While we cannot guarantee complete security, Octopus operates 
        using state-of-the-art network, data, and physical security practices. 
        We use industry standard procedures and processes to safeguard the confidentiality 
        of users’ personal information, such as firewalls, encryption, token authentication, 
        application proxies, monitoring technology, and adaptive analysis of network 
        traffic to track abuse of our network and its data. </p>
      <p>Access to and use of password protected and/or secure areas of the Octopus 
        Support Web site is restricted to authorized users only. Users are responsible 
        for maintaining the confidentiality of any password(s) they are given 
        to access such areas of the site, and are fully responsible for all activities 
        that occur under their password(s). Users agree to notify Octopus immediately 
        of any unauthorized use of their password(s). Unauthorized persons attempting 
        to access these areas may be subject to prosecution.</p>
      <p><b>Special provisions for our non-U.S. customers<br>
        </b>If the user is an individual resident of a country outside of the 
        United States, please be aware that Octopus may collect, use and disclose 
        personal data about the user on or throughout this Web site or as otherwise 
        described in the Octopus Privacy Statement, or any amendments hereto.&nbsp; 
        Such data will be stored on servers located in the United States, which 
        may have less stringent privacy practices than in the user’s resident 
        country.&nbsp; Furthermore, Octopus may transfer users’ personal data 
        outside of their country of residence for purposes of processing their 
        requests or providing our service or for other lawful business purposes.</p>
      <p><b>How to opt out or change information<br>
        </b>Users can review or change the information they have provided to us 
        on the registration page at any time by clicking on the ‘user profile' 
        button that appears at the top of any page on the <a href="http://my.octopus.com" class="pressLink">Personal 
        Edition site</a>.&nbsp; From time to time, some information may be purged 
        for system or other technical reasons at our sole discretion.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Users may opt out of receiving information from Octopus by unselecting 
        the appropriate fields from the user profile menu mentioned above.</p>
      <p><b>Consent<br>
        </b>By using our Service, users consent to Octopus’ collection and use 
        of information as described in this statement.&nbsp; Should we change 
        the way in which we use your personal information, we will get your consent 
        before using your information in this new way.</p>
      <p><b>Questions or concerns?<br>
        </b>Please feel free to contact us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacy@octopus.com" class="pressLink">privacy@octopus.com</a> if there 
        are any questions or concerns about this privacy statement or about Octopus’
