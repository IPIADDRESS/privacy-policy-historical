            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>
                Welcome to Octopus Deploy! We offer a deployment automation tool that you can download, and install on your own servers, and that 
                we may also provide in a hosted/Software-as-a-Service capacity. As you use this website or our any of our products, we may collect 
                information about you. This privacy policy will help you to understand what information Octopus Deploy collects, how we use it, and some choices that you have.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This policy covers information that we (<strong>Octopus Deploy Pty. Ltd.</strong> and related entities) collect from your use of "Octopus Deploy Services". "<strong>Octopus Deploy Services</strong>" includes our:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Websites</li>
                <li>SaaS Products</li>
                <li>Downloadable Products</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Information we collect and receive</h2>

            <p><strong>1. Information that you give to us directly</strong></p>

            <p>
                Our Websites, SaaS products and Downloadable Products may ask for information about you and the company you work for. This is collected 
                as you register for an account, purchase licenses, register for product trials, or otherwise use or interact 
                with our website. Examples of the information we collect includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contact information, such as your name, email, mailing address and phone number</li>
                <li>Billing information, such as credit card details and billing addresses</li>
                <li>Profile information, such as a username, profile photo and job title</li>
                <li>Preferences, such as notification and email marketing preferences</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This information is provided by you when you enter it into our website or use one of our products, and so you naturally 
                consent to us collecting it. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In some cases information about you may be entered by someone else, typically a billing or system administrator 
                at your company - for example when they set up an account for you, or include you as a contact on an invoice. 
                If you are providing information about someone else, you must have the authority to act for them and to consent to 
                the collection and use of their personal information as described in this policy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When you use our Downloadable Products, the information that we collect is limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contact information you provide when registering for a product trial</li>
                <li>Statistical summaries of how you use our Downloadable Products, such as the number of projects or deployments</li>
                <li>Server-specific information such as operating system versions, CPU usage, memory and disk size information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We also collect <strong>content</strong> that you create, input, send, submit or upload when using the Octopus Deploy Services. 
                Examples of content you might provide includes comments on blog posts, support requests and emails that you send us, or data that 
                you enter in the the course of using the functionality in our Websites or SaaS Products (but not Downloadable Products). This content 
                includes any personal information, or sensitive information, that you choose to include.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>2. Information that we collect indirectly</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                We also gather information about you indirectly, through observing how you use our Websites or SaaS Products. This includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Web server logs</strong>, which capture information including your IP address, browser and operating system version, and URL's requested. 
                This information is typically not personally identifying, though it may incidentally capture personally identifiable information if that information is included
                as part of the request (for example, in a URL query string).</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics data</strong> which is captured either by us, or by third parties analytics partners.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                As at the time this policy came into effect, we use the following third party analytics partners:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics</a>. To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, refer to <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/">Google's Policies and Principles</a>. 
                    Use the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a> to prevent analytics information from being sent to Google Analytics.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.optimizely.com/privacy/">Optimizely</a>, which helps us to test changes to our Website or SaaS Products and their effectiveness.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/privacy">Crazy Egg</a>, which gives us a better idea of what information people use on our Website</li>
                <li><a href="https://raygun.com/privacy">Raygun</a>, which helps us to understand our Website and SaaS Product's performance, and errors users may encounter</li>
                <li><a href="https://rocketfuel.com/privacy/">Rocket Fuel</a>, to support and optimise our digital marketing efforts and advertising campaigns</li>
            </ul>

            
            <p>
                <strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong>: we and our third party analytics partners, use various technologies to 
                collect information, such as cookies and web beacons. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory. 
                We use cookies to improve and customize Octopus Deploy Services and your experience; to allow you to access and use the Websites or SaaS Products 
                without re-entering your username or password; and to count visits and understand which areas and features of the Websites and SaaS 
                Products are most popular. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before 
                accepting a cookie from websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of our Websites 
                or SaaS Products. Octopus Deploy and our third party analytics partners also collect information using web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"). 
                Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Websites or SaaS Products or in emails that help us to deliver cookies, count visits, 
                understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.
            </p>


            <h2>How we use the information we collect</h2>

            <p>
