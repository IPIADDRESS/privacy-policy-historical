We want to make your experience on the&nbsp;Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the&nbsp;Internet’s vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete&nbsp;confidence.</p>
<p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to&nbsp;privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects&nbsp;information from all end users of our Internet services (the “Services”)-those who&nbsp;access some of our Services but do not have accounts (“Visitors”) as well as those&nbsp;who may purchase Products -what we do with the information we collect, and the&nbsp;choices Visitors have concerning the collection and use of such information. We&nbsp;request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used</strong></p>
<p>Introduction. Our company collects information in different ways from Visitors&nbsp;who access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites&nbsp;accessible through our Service.</p>
<p>Registration: Members may be asked to provide certain personal information&nbsp;when they sign up for our Products or Services including name, address,&nbsp;telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the&nbsp;type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The personal&nbsp;information collected from Members during the registration process is used to&nbsp;manage each Member’s account (such as for billing purposes). This information&nbsp;may be shared with third parties, as stated herein, or in special circumstances.</p>
<p>However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our&nbsp;Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the&nbsp;name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a&nbsp;result of the joint promotion for the purpose of offering you other products and&nbsp;In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any&nbsp;other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from&nbsp;personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total&nbsp;number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we&nbsp;may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements&nbsp;that appear on the Services.</p>
<p>Also, with purchases, we supply our member’s contact information, to our&nbsp;business partners, who then may contact the member by telephone after the&nbsp;member purchase. Sales proceeds are collected by the that business partner&nbsp;company. We also may supply other companies with contact information, for mail&nbsp;offers we believe would be of interest to our members, with or without&nbsp;compensation from those companies. At times we may send an advertisement for&nbsp;a third party product, where we collect the sales proceeds, and forward the&nbsp;purchaser’s information to that third party.</p>
<p>Our Company Partners and Sponsors: Some products and services may be offered&nbsp;to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor&nbsp;seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members some of these&nbsp;products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>Online Shopping: At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or&nbsp;register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new product and&nbsp;service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information,&nbsp;such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent&nbsp;directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the&nbsp;recipient, such as the recipient’s name, address, and phone number. Our&nbsp;company has no control over the third parties’ use of any personal information&nbsp;you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so.</p>
<p>If you order services or products directly from our company, we use the personal&nbsp;information you provide to process that order. We do share this information with&nbsp;outside parties that we do business with.</p>
<p>Online Advertisements: Our company may display our online advertisements. In&nbsp;those cases we share information about our Visitors and Members collected&nbsp;through the registration process as well as through online surveys and&nbsp;promotions with these advertisers.</p>
<p>Additionally, in some instances, we use this information to deliver tailored&nbsp;advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture&nbsp;company tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an&nbsp;advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the information we have collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to the intended&nbsp;audience. Our company does share personal information about its Visitors or</p>
<p>Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies.</p>
<p>Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to&nbsp;our company, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we</p>
<p>Voluntary Customer Surveys: We may periodically conduct both business and&nbsp;individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these&nbsp;surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to&nbsp;improve the types of products and services we offer and how we provide them to</p>
<p>We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our&nbsp;Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey&nbsp;questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment,&nbsp;industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new&nbsp;services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information&nbsp;may be shared with third parties.</p>
<p>Promotions: Our company may offer polls, contests, sweepstakes, drawings,&nbsp;games, content, or other promotions that are sponsored by or cobranded with&nbsp;third parties. You may be entered in a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion,&nbsp;simply by making a purchase from us or by providing us with personally&nbsp;identifiable information for some other reason or purpose. Due to these third&nbsp;party relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable&nbsp;information that visitors voluntarily submit to our company. Our company has no&nbsp;control over third parties’ use of this information.</p>
<p>Additionally, personally identifiable information may be collected when you order&nbsp;products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe&nbsp;to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our&nbsp;online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information&nbsp;that may be collected at these pages include but may not be limited to: name,&nbsp;address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information,&nbsp;and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs,&nbsp;and services. Our sponsors or third parties may send you material that relates to&nbsp;our company’s services, products or activities.</p>
<p>Special Cases: It is our company’s policy to use or share the personal information&nbsp;about Visitors or Members in ways described herein without additional notice or&nbsp;means to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
<p>Also, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or&nbsp;information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through&nbsp;our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is&nbsp;reasonable to do so, including: credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant&nbsp;database agencies, law enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic&nbsp;Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or&nbsp;governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that&nbsp;is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may&nbsp;be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, or other user policies;&nbsp;to operate the Services properly; or to protect our company and our Members.</p>
