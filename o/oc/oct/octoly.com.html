This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Octoly website.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Octoly's public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others.</p>
<p>Octoly encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from Octoly so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. Octoly is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Octoly website.</p>
<h2>Use of your Personal Information</h2>

<h2>Use of Cookies/Targeted Advertising</h2>
<p>The Octoly website may use tracking technology such as "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Octoly pages, or register with the Octoly Website or Services, a cookie helps Octoly to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Octoly website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Octoly features that you customized.</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Octoly services or websites you visit.</p>
<p>Octoly may also use cookies, pixels, web beacons (which are usually small, transparent graphic images), operating system and device information and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, the features and information for which you searched and viewed, the email you opened, or on which advertisements you clicked.</p>
<p>Octoly works with third party companies (e.g., ad networks) that may use cookies for purposes including, without limitation, understanding Web usage patterns of users who see advertisements on the Website, controlling the sequence of advertisements you see, making sure you don't see the same advertisement too many times, determining your interests and tailoring advertisements and promotions based on those interests. The advertisement may appear when you are visiting a different section of this Website, another Website or any other website on the Internet if the website also has a relationship with Octoly's vendor. You can choose to limit Behavioral Advertising on the Website by clicking&nbsp;http://www.aboutads.info/choices/&nbsp;and opting-out of cookies placed by those vendors listed. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements but the advertising may not be as relevant to your interests. If you change your computer, change your browser, or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out.</p>
<p>Octoly adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance (for more information click here at&nbsp;http://www.aboutads.info/consumers).</p>
<p>Advertisers or other third parties on the Website may also engage in Behavioral Advertising and use cookies and web beacons in the manner described above. Octoly does not control these advertisers or other parties' use of cookies or web beacons or what they do with the information they collect. Many third party vendors that engage in Behavioral Advertising participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and abide by NAI and/or DAA principles. If you wish to opt out of participating in advertising programs conducted by NAI and DAA members or learn more about the NAI and DAA, please go to the&nbsp;NAI OPT-OUT&nbsp;website (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and&nbsp;DAA CHOICE PAGE&nbsp;(http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and follow the instructions. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements, but the advertising may not be as relevant to your interests. If you change your computer, change your browser or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out.</p>
<h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2>
<p>Octoly secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. Octoly does not warrant the security of its servers, nor does Octoly warrant that your information, including Personal Information, will be completely secure or not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet.</p>
<h2>Children Under Thirteen</h2>
<p>Octoly does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If you are under the age of thirteen, you must ask your parent or guardian for permission to use this website.</p>
