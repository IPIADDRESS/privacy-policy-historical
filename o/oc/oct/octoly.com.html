<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p>Effective Date: January 2nd, 2015</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy governs our policies and practices with respect to the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") and other data that is collected by The Octoly Project, Inc. ("Octoly", "we", "us" and/or "our") in connection with our website, located at http://www.Octoly.com (the "Site" and “the Service").
</p>
<p>
By using our Services you are consenting to our processing of your Personal Information and data as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended. As used herein, "processing" means using or accessing information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, combining and disclosing information. Our servers are located in the United States. Accordingly, if you reside outside the United States, by using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Information will be transferred to the United States, and processed and stored in the United States. By using our Services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h2>
<p>
<strong>A Note About How Octoly Works:</strong>
Octoly analyzes data that is made available publicly through the Internet in order to measure influence for Internet users, including, but not limited to, our registered users. Octoly presents some of this data on the Site, such data may also be available on other websites and Octoly may share this data with our third party partners (as described in more detail below). Octoly does not analyze non-public data from private networks (in other words, networks that are password-protected) unless you authorize us to access such data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Information Collected Upon Registration:</strong>
If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Services and/or to have access to or use of certain parts of the Services, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain Personal Information to Octoly. Personal Information that we may collect in such instances may include your full user name, password, email address, city, time zone, telephone number, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in your public profile.
</p>
<p>
With respect to the Octoly Service specifically, providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find opportunities in the Octoly system.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Geo-location Data:</strong>
Octoly receives location information from the Social Media Services (as defined below) that you enable within the Services and also (with your permission) from your mobile device ("Geo-location Data"). We use Geo-location Data to:
</p><ul>
<li>complete your Octoly profile (for example, to indicate that you are located in France</li>
<li>customize the Services to make them more relevant to you</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
<strong>Log Data:</strong>
When you interact with the Site or use our Services, our servers automatically receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information ("Log Data"). This Log Data is collected passively and may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the Site pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider, the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to provide you with the Services and pool it with other information to monitor the use of the Services, and for the technical administration of the Services. We do not associate your IP address with any other Personal Information to identify you personally, except in cases where we are asked to comply with a subpoena or other legal demand or where we suspect that there has been a violation of our policies, our Terms of Service and/or applicable law.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies:</strong>
Like many websites and services, we also use "cookie" technology to collect additional Site usage data and to improve the Site and Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect Personal Information. Also, our cookies only collect information with respect to your visits to and actions on our Site. Octoly may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Services and our Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our Services. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and Services and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
</p>
<h2>USE OF INFORMATION</h2>
<p>
Octoly uses the Personal Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. We will use your Personal Information in order to provide you with access to and use of our Services, to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services and to better understand our users. If you contact us by email through the Services, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you. In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about our products and services and the products and services of our partners that we believe may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such marketing information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.
</p>
<p>
In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of our Services, Octoly also often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Information and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Octoly may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents, advertisers and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Octoly may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes (including providing advertising use cases to actual or potential advertisers).
</p>
<h2>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</h2>
<p>
We consider your information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Service Providers:</strong>
We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your Personal Information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services. Partners: From time to time, Octoly may partner with third parties to improve your Octoly experience. Please be aware that the privacy policy of such partners will govern their use of your Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, in connection with the operation, promotion, advertising or marketing of our Services, we may provide certain of our partners with Personal Information (e.g., your name or Octoly username) and other content or information related to you (e.g., your profile picture), or provide certain of our partners with access to our application programming interfaces ("APIs") in order to access such information using information (such as YouTube handles) already in their possession.
</p>
<p>
Please note: each time we provide any of your Personal Information to our partners, we only provide information to these partners that is publicly available or publicly viewable in your Octoly profile at the time we provide it.
</p>
<p>
Business Transfers: Octoly may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Disclosures for Legal Purposes:</strong>
Octoly may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Octoly, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
</p>
<h2>SECURITY</h2>
<p>
Octoly is very concerned about the security of your Personal Information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored Personal Information to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
</p>
<h2>LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h2>
<p>
Our Services contain links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personally identifiable information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
</p>
<h2>OUR POLICY TOWARDS CHILDREN</h2>
<p>
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without his/her consent, he or she should contact us at support@octoly.com. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information via the Services without their permission.
</p>
<h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>
The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Octoly to make changes to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may be updated or modified from time to time for any reason without prior notice. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site or by emailing you. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
</p>
