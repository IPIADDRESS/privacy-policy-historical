<p><strong>OCEAN SAFETY LIMITED PRIVACY POLICY</strong> <br><br><strong>Information about our organisation and website<br><br></strong>Ocean Safety (“OS”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policy and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected online and how that information is used. OS is notified as a data controller with the UK Information Commissioner (registration number icn841) and details of OS's notification can be viewed on the website www.dataprotection.gov.uk. <br><br><strong>Data automatically collected</strong> <br><br>We log each User's domain and IP address automatically; this information allows us to log the activity of each User and to determine the date of each User's first log on, number of repeat visits, areas of the Website visited. We use this information internally for the sole purpose of evaluating the performance of the Website and how the Website is used. <br><br><strong>Cookies</strong> <br><br>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer as a result of visiting a web site. This allows the site to know that you have visited before and in some cases can be used to record your preferences. <br><br>We use cookies to remember the information which you input each time you use the Website and to store preferences entered by you for the sole purpose of personalising your visit to the Website and making it easier for you to use the Website. We also use cookies to measure the frequency of User visits to the Website. <br><br>Two types of cookies are used on this Website:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Session Cookies, which are temporary cookies that only remain until your browser is closed. They are used by our web application in order to maintain the information relating to your transaction from page to page following any input, such as when information is completed over several screens; and </li>
<li>Cookies used to save your selections made when using the Product search facility of the Website. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can still use most of this Website with cookies turned off. To stop cookies being placed on your terminal equipment refer to your specific internet browser. In a few cases blocking cookies may reduce the functionality of some sites or prevent access to them depending on your chosen browser options. Cookies can also easily be deleted through your specific internet browser, although this means your settings will not be retained. <br><br>For further information visit: <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/">http://www.aboutcookies.org</a>.

When emailing us, or subscribing for free news or information we need your e-mail address, name and other limited personal identifiers, typically name and contact number. When using the secure areas of the Website, Users and Customers will be required to enter their credit or debit card number, home address, delivery address where applicable and e-mail address. <br><br>We will ensure that collection and use of that personal information strictly accords with the principles of data protection and data privacy contained in the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and EU Directive 95/46/EC which governs the collection, use and handling of personal data and gives you certain rights including the right to request access to the data that we hold on you and to have any errors corrected. <br><br>Any information which you submit on the Website will be used solely for the purposes of either administering your contract for sale of a product between you and OS or, if you have requested information from OS, providing that information to you. <br><br>From time to time we conduct market research using the Website and we may ask you for information for these purposes. We cannot identify you from such information and any information you submit in response to any such request will be gathered, stored and used on an anonymous basis. Please note we will not send you marketing material unless you have requested it. <br><br><strong>Data retention</strong> <br><br>Personal information you submit on the Website will be held only for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which you have given that data.
