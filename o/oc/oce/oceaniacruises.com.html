Because we value the importance of our relationship with our users, we present to you the following policy and guidelines with which we conduct our online services to you.
								<br><br>
								<b>Acquisition of data</b><br>
								Oceania Cruises, Inc. collects information about users through voluntary submission, IP addresses and cookies.

								<b>Voluntary Submission of data</b> <br>
								When users elect to subscribe to newsletters or magazines, enter contests or to access special sections, users are required to supply certain personal information during the registration process. Information collected through these forms may be used by Oceania Cruises, Inc.  to gather broad demographic information about our users in general, for audits and to perform statistical analysis of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our Web site. 
								<br><br>
								Oceania Cruises, Inc. will not disclose (share, sell or divulge) any personal information, such as address, e-mail, telephone and fax numbers, to third parties unless we have informed you, been authorized by you or are required to do so by law. Oceania Cruises, Inc. will maintain this information in accordance with our strict security and confidentiality standards.

								<b>Agents</b><br>
								We employ an agency to perform functions on our behalf.
