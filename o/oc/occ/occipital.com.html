        <p><em>Legally required disclosure</em>. We reserve the right to disclose information if we believe  that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) protect or defend the rights or property of us or users of the services.</p>

        <p><em>Notice to California Residents</em>. A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (a "California Customer") may request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.  In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California Customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal data was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal data that were disclosed.  California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing privacy@occipital.com.  Please note that we are required to respond to one request per California Customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.</p>

        <h2>Managing your Content and information</h2>

        <p>You may opt-out of any promotional emails we send by following the instructions in the email you receive.  Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you emails related to your account or transactions thereunder, or notices of any updates to our Terms or this Policy.</p>

        <p>You may opt-out of sharing location from your device by disabling location features entirely for the Software from your device settings (the exact steps to do so will vary based on your device).</p>

        <p>You may choose not to create an account thus avoid giving us your name and email address, although many features may require the creation of an account.
