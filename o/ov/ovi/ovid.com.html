    <p>By entering or using our Web Services, you are consenting to our collection and use of your data in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

<h2><u>Information We Collect</u></h2>
   <p>
    </p><ul>
        <li><h2>Personal Information</h2></li>
	</ul><p></p>
    <p>When you use the Web Services, we may ask for or receive “Personal Information” about you. Personal Information is information that enables us to identify you or information that relates to you. Personal Information may include your name and physical address, email addresses, telephone numbers, online identifiers, location data, behavioral or demographic attributes, past transactional behavior on the Web Services, and information obtained from third parties. Information you make publicly available (e.g., in online forums or publicly available in social media) is not considered Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. </p>

    <p>As a user of the Web Services, you are under no obligation to provide us with Personal Information, but your refusal to do so may prevent you from using certain Web Service features.</p>

       <ul>
        <li><h2>Other Information </h2></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Like most websites, when you use the Web Services we collect “Other Information” which does not, on its own, reveal your specific identity nor directly relate to you as an individual. We use this Other Information to provide you with a personalized Web Service experience, to deliver the information, services, resources and products that are most relevant and useful to you and as described below. </p>
    
    <p>In some instances, we may combine the Other Information we collect with Personal Information to better understand your interests and to help us maintain data accuracy and provide and enhance the Web Service. For example, we may derive your geographical location from your IP address and combine data about your usage of the Web Services with your name. If we combine Other Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information. </p>
    
    <p>We only share Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy or as required by law.</p>

   <h2><u>How We Collect Information</u></h2>
    <p>We and our third-party service providers may collect both Personal Information and Other Information from the following sources:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><h2>Data from Third Parties</h2></li>
    </ul>

	<br>We may collect information about the computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access the Web Services. Such information may include your IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language and other transactional information.</p>
	
	<p><i>Location Information</i>
	<br>If you enable certain location-based features, our Web Services may be able to deliver content based on your current location. If you choose to enable the feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device, which will then be used by our application. If you elect to have a location-based search saved to your history, we will store that information on our servers. If you do not enable the location-based service, or if an application does not contain that feature, the application will not transmit to us, and we will not collect or store, location information.</p>
	
	<p><i>“Do Not Track” Signals</i>
    <br>Some Web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to Web sites that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. However, these Web browsers communicate “Do Not Track” signals differently, making it unworkable to consistently honor such requests. As a result, our Web Services are not designed to respond to “Do Not Track” signals.</p>

   </p>
   
			<h2><u>Interest-based Advertising</u></h2>
   <p>We use cookies, Web beacons and other similar automated tracking technologies to show targeted ads on your device(s). These ads are more likely to be relevant to you because they are based on inferences drawn from location data, web viewing data collected across non-affiliated sites over time, and/or other application use data. This is called “Interest-based Advertising”. In addition, certain third parties may collect data on our website and combine this data with information collected from other websites for purposes that include Interest based Advertising as described above in our “Third Party Collection of Information” section.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about this type of advertising or would prefer to “opt out” of having your information used for website interest-based advertising (if possible), you may visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>. To opt out of the use of your mobile device ID for targeted advertising, please see <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>. Please note, some third-party providers do not participate in the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and may limit your ability to “opt out”.</p>
<p>We do not control and are not responsible for such third-party advertisers’ and ad networks’ information practices or their use of cookies and other ad service technologies.</p>

 <h2><u>Security Measures</u></h2>
    
    <p>We have implemented numerous security features designed to help protect your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, when a user places an order on our website or application or accesses their account information, that user may be offered the use of a secure server. A secure server encrypts information a visitor inputs before it is sent to us and is also used to securely store Personal Information. Please be advised, however, that while we have endeavored to create secure and reliable Web Services for users, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to/from us via the Web Services or e-mail cannot be guaranteed. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will always be unable to defeat our security measures.
