provided in the registration process used for any purpose unrelated to the purpose for which the
information was provided to us.  When you sign up for an email list, you will be given instructions
at that time on how to remove yourself from that list.</p>

name, address, telephone and email, and allow you to set a password.    When you engage in certain
activities on our site, such as ordering products and downloading software, we require you to login
using your email address and password.  When ordering products on the site we do require your credit
card information.  We share only the information that is absolutely necessary with third parties
involved in the processing of your order such as the credit card clearing house.  All transactions
between the parties mentioned and ourselves are done so in a secure fashion.  In addition we may need
to share your shipping information with a carrier with whom we ship your product.</p>
<p>We request that you set a password for access to our download page.  The password and your email
identify you when you return to the download page so you do not have to enter your personal information
again. When you login to our site to access a password protected areas, such as our download page, we
set a security cookie that lasts as long as your browser is running. This keeps us from having to request
your password for each protected page that you access. If you have disabled cookies in your browser, you
can still browse our site, but you will not be able to place an order online or download software.</p>
<p>Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory
and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you
will not be able to engage in that activity. </p>
<p>If you order a product that is to be electronically downloaded, the information is used to register your
license and rights, if any, to technical support, upgrade discounts, and any other benefits that may be made
available to registered users. </p>
<h3>Registration Information</h3>
<p>Registration Information is protected in several ways. Access by you to your Registration Information is
available through a password selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge
your password to anyone. In addition, your Registration Information resides on a secure server that only selected
OverDrive personnel have access to via a password. </p>
<p>In addition to the information you provide, we automatically record your IP address when you place an order
to help us detect fraudulent activity. We may share this with the financial institution that issued the credit
card with which an order was placed, or with law enforcement authorities, if we determine use of the credit card
was fraudulent.</p>
<h3>E-Mail/Online Forms</h3>
<p>In various places on our site, you will find links for sending us an email message as well as online forms
to contact us through. We use your email address to send you a reply and we will retain your message only for
later referral should you ever decide to contact us again. Your message and email address remain confidential
unless you specifically give us permission otherwise.</p>
<h2>External Links</h2>
<p>We have provided links to other sites, outside the control of OverDrive, that we think you may find useful. If
you click these links, you will leave OverDrive and enter sites that may have different privacy policies than
OverDrive.</p>
<h2>Newsletter Subscription</h2>
<p>We make available an email newsletter and should you decide to subscribe we will send you newsletter
announcements from time to time.  We will use this information only to send you announcements in regards
to OverDrive products and services as well as related issues concerning OverDrive.  You may unsubscribe
at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@overdrive.com">info@overdrive.com</a> and requesting
to be removed.   </p>

<p>Aside from the previously mentioned third parties involved in the processing of your order, we do not
share your personally identifiable information with any other entities. In addition, we will not send you
any communications that you do not explicitly request from us. For example, the only way for you to receive
our email newsletter is if you choose to subscribe, either through the form on our home page or help desk
page or by having the appropriate box checked during the ordering process.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We utilize industry standard SSL encryption when accepting your credit card information during our online
checkout process. In addition, we utilize the same encryption standard when transferring your credit card data
to our internal fulfillment system. To further enhance our security measures, our fulfillment system is not
accessible via the Internet and we delete from our web site database all credit card information within 24
hours of receipt.</p>
<p>We have also taken the appropriate security measures to safeguard your personal information after it has
been transferred to our fulfillment system. For example, our computer network is password protected, and is
inaccessible via the Internet.  Paper copies, if any, are shredded before disposal.</p>

purchasing an OverDrive product is classified as Registration Information.  If there are any changes or
