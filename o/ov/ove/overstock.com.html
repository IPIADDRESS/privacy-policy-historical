</p><p><b>CERTAIN EXCEPTIONAL DISCLOSURES</b> </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>We may disclose your information if necessary to protect our legal 
      rights, if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful 
      conduct, or Overstock has good faith belief that such action is necessary 
      to (1) conform to the requirements of law or comply with governmental 
      orders, court orders, or legal process served on Overstock or (2) to 
      protect and defend the property or rights of Overstock, the users of its 
      website or the public. This includes exchanging information with other 
      companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk 
      protection. If Overstock.com should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with 
      another company, we may sell the information you provide to us on the 
      Overstock.com website to a third party or share your personal information 
      with the company we merge with. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>WHAT ARE COOKIES? WHY DO WE USE THEM?</b> </p>
      <p></p>
      
<p>Cookies are very tiny text files that are stored on your computer when you 
visit certain web pages that record your preferences. Overstock.com uses cookies 
to keep track of what you have in your shopping cart and to remember you when 
you return to our store. They cannot harm your computer and they do not contain 
any personal or private information. You must accept cookies to shop at Overstock.com. 
</p><p></p>
<p></p>
      <p><b>HOW DO WE PROTECT INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</b> </p>
      <p></p>
      
<p>We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and 
we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical 
and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity 
of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we 
believe the measures implemented by our web site reduce the likelihood of security 
problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. Overstock.com's 
servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption technology that works with 
Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and AOL's browser, so that only 
Overstock.com can read a customer's personal information. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP USER INFORMATION?</b> </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as 
      long as we reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to 
      changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to 
      free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the 
      law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum could 
      stay in the public domain indefinitely. 
      </p><p>Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the 
      extent feasible and within our direct control. Note: we have greater 
      control over recently collected data than for archived data. Once data is 
      removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to 
      accommodate specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention 
      policy applies. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>YOUR CONSENT TO THIS POLICY</b> </p>
      <p></p>
      
<p>By using the Overstock.com web site, you agree to this Privacy and Security 
Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy and Security Policy and it supersedes 
any earlier version. Our <a href="http://www.overstock.com/cgi-bin/d2.cgi?PAGE=STATICPAGE&amp;PAGE_ID=25">Terms 
and Conditions</a> take precedence over any conflicting Policy provision. We may 
change our Privacy and Security Policy by posting a new version of the policy 
on this page which it is your responsibility to review frequently. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>LEGAL DISCLAIMER</b> </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any 
      kind. We are not responsible for events beyond our direct control. This 
      Privacy and Security Policy is governed by Utah law, excluding conflicts 
      of law principles. Any legal actions against us must be commenced in Utah 
      within one year after the claim arose, or be barred. </p>
      <p></p>
