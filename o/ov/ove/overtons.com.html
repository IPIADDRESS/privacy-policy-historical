This Privacy Policy covers the “personal information” we collect
through our Sites. “Personal information” is information that
identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other
information available to us. Examples of personal information include
your name, address, email address, telephone number, and the
information you provide when you request a catalog, subscribe to a
newsletter, or make a purchase at one of our online stores.<br>
                      <br>
                      The terms “you” and “your,” when used in this Privacy Policy, mean any user of our Sites.<br>
                      <br>
This Policy is part of the Terms and Conditions that govern your use of
our Sites. To review our Terms and Conditions, click <a href="/customerservice/termsandconditions.shtml">here.</a><br>

                      <strong>Your Consent to This Privacy Policy<br>
                      </strong>Please
take a few minutes to review this Privacy Policy. By accessing or using
our Sites, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy. IF YOU
DO NOT AGREE TO THE COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL
INFORMATION AS SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE EXIT AND DO NOT
USE OUR SITES.<br>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong><br>
As we add new features and functionality to our Sites, we may need to
update or revise this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to do so, at
any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version on
our Sites. These changes will be effective as of the date we post the
revised version on our Sites. They will apply only to the personal
information we collect after we have posted the revised version. Your
use of one of our Sites following any such change constitutes your
consent to the terms of the revised Privacy Policy. For this reason, it
is important to review this Privacy Policy regularly. If we modify this
Privacy Policy, we will provide a notice at the top of this Privacy
Policy for at least 30 days after the new effective date. <br>
                      <br>
You may access the current version of this Privacy Policy at any time
by clicking on the link marked “Privacy Policy” at the bottom of each
page of our Sites.<br>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>Privacy Notices<br>
                      </strong>This
Privacy Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by
privacy notices (“Privacy Notices”) provided at the time we collect
your personal information. For example, certain pages of our Sites may
contain Privacy Notices providing details about the personal
information we collect on those pages, why we need that information,
and choices you may have about the ways we use that information. Our
Privacy Notices are part of this Privacy Policy.<br>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>What Personal Information Do We Collect When You Use Our Sites?<br>
                      </strong><em>Information You Provide.</em>
We collect the personal information you knowingly provide (using your
mouse and keyboard) when you use our Sites. The information we collect
depends on how you use our Sites. For example, if you sign up to
receive email communications from us, we collect your name and email
address and any related information you provide. If you make a purchase
at one of our online stores, we collect the information you submit when
you place your order, including your credit card and shipping
information. If you ship an item to another person, we collect the
information you provide about that person, such as their name, address
and other contact information.<br>
                      <br>
                      <em>Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser.</em>
We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your Web
browser. This information typically includes the IP address of your
Internet service provider, the name and version of your operating
system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your
visit, and the pages you visit. Please check your browser if you want
to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your
settings.<br>
                      <br>
                      <em>This information does not identify you personally.</em>
Generally, we use this information to improve our Site and make it more
compatible with the technology used by our visitors. In most cases, we
do not link the information sent by your browser to information that
identifies you personally. We do, however, review our server logs –
which contain visitors’ IP addresses -- for security purposes, such as
detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity,
we may share our server logs with the appropriate investigative
authorities who could use that information to trace and identify
individuals.<br>
                      <br>
                      <em>Cookies and Similar Technologies.</em>
We use "cookies" and other Web technologies to collect information and
support certain features of our Sites. For example, we may use these
technologies to<br>
                      <br> collect information
about the ways visitors use our Sites – which pages they visit, which
links they use, and how long they stay on each page;<br>
                      <br>
to support the features and functionality of our Sites – for example,
to track the items in your shopping cart; to save you the trouble of
reentering information already in our database; and to prompt the
settings you established on previous visits to our Sites; and<br>
                      <br>
                      to personalize your experience when you use our Sites.<br>
                      <br>
Generally, the information we collect using these Web technologies does
not identify you personally. If, however, you have created a user
identity, for example, by making a purchase or signing up to use a
password-protected area of our Sites, we may link this information we
collect using Web technologies to other information that identifies you
personally.<br>
                      <br>
If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to
reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your
computer. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave our
Sites. Although you are not required to accept our cookies when you
visit our Sites, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will
not be able to use all of the features and functionality of our Sites.<br>
                      <br>
                      <em>Supplemental Information.</em>
From time to time, we may supplement the information you give us with
information from other sources, such as information validating your
address or demographic information based on your zip code. We may also
supplement the information you give us with information we collect from
you through other channels. For example, if you shop at one of our
stores, we may supplement the information you provide online with
information we collect at the store.<br>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>How Do We Use Your Personal Information?<br>
                      </strong>Generally.  We use the personal information we collect through our Sites<br>
                      <br>
                      to provide the information, products and services you request;<br>
                      <br>
                      for security, credit or fraud prevention purposes;<br>
                      <br>
                      to provide you with effective customer service; <br>
                      <br>
                      to provide you with a personalized experience when you use our Sites;<br>
                      <br>
                      to contact you with special offers and other information we believe will be of interest to you; <br>
                      <br>
                      to contact you with information and notices related to your use of our Site; <br>
                      <br>
                      to invite you to participate in surveys and provide feedback to us; <br>
                      <br>
                      to better understand your needs and interests;<br>
                      <br>
                      to improve the content, functionality and usability of our Sites;<br>
                      <br>
                      to improve our products and services;<br>
                      <br>
                      to improve our marketing and promotional efforts; and<br>
                      <br>
                      for any other purpose identified in an applicable Privacy Notice or other agreement between you and us.</p>
                    <p>Third-Party
Information. If you ship an item to another person, we collect the
personal information you provide about him or her and will use that
information just as we use your personal information. For example, we
may add that person to our catalog mailing list. If that person does
not wish to receive catalogs or other promotional communications from
us, he or she may contact us using the contact information provided in
the catalog, on each electronic communication or on our Sites.</p>
                    <p>Employment
Information. Some of our Sites include “careers” areas. When you use
our Sites to search for job openings or submit an online employment
application, we may ask you to provide certain personal information,
such as your name, address, telephone number, email address,
educational background and employment history. You may also send us
your resume and other information relating to your job search or
application. We use the information you submit on the careers area of
our Sites only for recruiting and employment purposes, we do not use it
for marketing purposes. Please note that by submitting personal
information to us through the careers area of one of our Sites, you
authorize us to transmit and store your information in our recruitment
database and to circulate that information within the Gander Mountain
family of businesses for the purpose of evaluating your qualifications
for job vacancies. If you are hired by one of us, the information you
provide during the recruiting process will become part of our employee
records. The careers areas of our Sites may be “powered” by a
third-party service provider.<br>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?<br>
                    </strong><em>Service Providers.</em>
We may share personal information collected through our Sites with
companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf, for
example, companies that provide support services to us (such as credit
card verification services, online recruiting services, and web hosting
services) or that help us market our products and services (such as
third-party web analytics firms and marketing consultants).<br>
                    <br>
                    <em>With Other Members of the Gander Mountain Family of Businesses.</em>
When you provide personal information through one of our Sites, the
owner of that Site may share your personal information with other
members of the Gander Mountain family of businesses. Every member of
the Gander Mountain family of businesses is required to handle
information collected through our Sites in accordance with this Privacy
Policy and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.
Accordingly, if we share your personal information with other members
of the Gander Mountain family of businesses, they will use your
information only as permitted under this Privacy Policy and will honor
the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.<br>
                    <br>
                    <em>With Carefully Selected Third Parties.</em>
From time to time we may share our mailing lists with carefully
selected third parties (outside the Gander Mountain family of
businesses) for their own marketing purposes. For example, we exchange
our catalog mailing lists with other catalog companies. If you do not
want us to share your personal information with these third parties,
please let us know by following the procedure described below under
"Your Choices".<br>
                    <br>
                    <em>Business Transactions.</em>
We may decide, for strategic or other reasons, to sell, buy, merge or
otherwise reorganize one or more of our businesses. A transaction of
this type may involve the disclosure of personal information to
prospective purchasers. In such cases, we will take reasonable measures
to protect the personal information we disclose, for example, by
requiring the prospective purchaser to sign a non-disclosure agreement
limiting the use and protecting the confidentiality of the personal
information.<br>
                    <br>
                    <em>Business Transfers.</em>
Your personal information may be transferred to a company that has
acquired the stock or assets of a member of the Gander Mountain family
of businesses or one of its businesses, for example, as the result of a
sale, merger, reorganization or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs,
the acquiring company’s use of your personal information will still be
subject to this Privacy Policy and the privacy preferences you have
expressed to us.<br>
                    <br>
                    <em>Compliance With Laws and Protection of Our Rights and the Rights of Others.</em>
We may disclose personal information when we, in good faith, believe
disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, a court order or a
subpoena. We may also disclose personal information to prevent or
investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to
enforce or apply our online Terms and Conditions or other agreements;
or to protect our own rights or property or the rights, property or
safety of our users or others.<br>
                    <br>
                  <em>As Described in a Privacy Notice</em>.
We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as described
in any Privacy Notice posted on the Web page where you provide that
information. By providing your personal information on that Web page
you will be consenting to the disclosure of your personal information
as described in that Privacy Notice.<br>
                  <br>
                  <em>As Described in a Click-Through Agreement.</em>
We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as described
in any click-through agreement to which you have agreed.<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Your Choices<br>
                  </strong><em>In General.</em>
We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use
and disclose your personal information. In most cases, we will ask you
to indicate your choices at the time we collect your personal
information. We will also include an “opt-out” link in each electronic
newsletter or promotional email we send you, so that you can inform us
that you do not wish to receive such communications from us in the
future.<br>
                  <br>
                  <em>You May Ask Us to Remove Your Personal Information from Our Mailing Lists.</em>  If at any time you wish to be taken off our mailing lists, please <a href="/customerservice/contactus.shtml">contact us</a>.
Please provide your full name, postal address and email address so that
we can find you on our mailing lists. You may ask to be removed from
our catalog mailing lists and/or to be removed from our general direct
marketing mailing lists. Once we have the information we need, we will
remove you from our catalog and/or general direct marketing mailing
lists as you have requested. Please give us a reasonable amount of time
to honor your request.<br>
                  <br>
                  <em>You May Ask Us Not to Share Your Personal Information With Third Parties for Their Marketing Purposes.</em>
If you do not want us to share your personal information with third
parties (outside the Gander Mountain family of businesses) to use for
their marketing purposes, please <a href="/customerservice/contactus.shtml">contact us</a>.
