                          <p>As we add new features and functionality to our Sites, we may need to update or revise this Policy.  We reserve the right to do so, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version on our Sites.  These changes will be effective as of the date we post the revised version on our Sites.  They will apply only to the personal information we collect after we have posted the revised version.  Your use of one of our Sites following any such change constitutes your consent to the terms of the revised Policy.  For this reason, it is important to review this Policy regularly.  If we modify this Policy, we will provide a notice at the top of this Policy for at least thirty days after the new effective date. </p>

                          <p>This Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by privacy notices (âPrivacy Noticesâ) provided at the time we collect your personal information.  For example, certain pages of our Sites may contain Privacy Notices providing details about the personal information we collect on those pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information.  Our Privacy Notices are part of this Policy.</p>

                          <p><strong>Country-Specific Notices</strong></p>
                          <p>Privacy requirements vary from country to country. To meet these requirements we may include certain âcountry-specific noticesâ as part of this Policy. If any of the terms of a country-specific notice are different than the general terms of this Policy, the terms of the country-specific notice will supplement or amend this Policy, but only to the extent that the laws of that country apply to the collection of personal information through our Sites.</p>

                          <p><strong>What Personal Information Do We Collect When You Use Our Sites?</strong></p>
                          <p>Information You Provide.  We collect the personal information you knowingly provide (using your mouse and keyboard) when you use our Sites.  The information we collect depends on how you use our Sites.  For example:</p>

                          <p>If you sign up to receive e-mail communications from us, we collect your name and e-mail address and any related information you provide.</p>
                          <p>&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>If you make a purchase at one of our online stores, we collect the information you submit when you place your order, including your credit card and shipping information.  If you ship an item to another person, we collect the information you provide about that person, such as his/her name, address and other contact information.</p>

                          <p><em>Information Sent to Us</em> by Your Web Browser.  We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your Web browser.  This information typically includes your IP address, the name and version of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages you visit.  Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings. </p>

                          <p>This information does not identify you personally.  Generally, we use this information to improve our Site and make it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors.  In most cases, we do not link the information sent by your browser to information that identifies you personally. However, if you have created a user identity, for example, by signing up to use a password-protected area of our Sites, we may link your IP address to information that identifies you personally. We may also link your IP address to personally identifiable information you submit in placing an order. In addition, when you access our Sites by clicking on a link in an e-mail or other electronic communication you receive from us, your browser tells us that someone has clicked on a particular link in a communication addressed to you. We collect that information to improve the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. We may also review our server logsâwhich contain visitorsâ IP addressesâfor security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network.  If we suspect criminal activity, we may share our server logs with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.</p>
