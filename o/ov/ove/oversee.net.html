<ul type="disc">
<li>the information we collect about you,</li>
<li>how that information may be used,</li>
<li>with whom it may be shared,</li>

<p><strong>Information Collection</strong></p>
<p>We may collect personal information that can identify you such as your name and e-mail address, as well as other information that does not identify you.

<p><strong>Third Party List Information.</strong> We may also obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from third party data gathering sources. We may match this third-party collected information with the personally identifying information that you provide to us. When obtaining this information from third parties, Oversee.net seeks assurances from such third parties that they have the right to provide the information to us.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information Collection Technology.</strong> We and our business partners, such as advertisers, may use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our Site.<span>&nbsp; For example, we and our business partners may collect and store non-personally identifying information through technologies such as cookies, log files, clear gifs (also known as web beacons), and other tracking pixels and third parties to help determine user viewing preferences for advertising and other purposes.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><em>Third parties for legal process</em><em>:</em> In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from any law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.

California residents may, no more than once per calendar year, request information about our disclosures of certain categories of personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. To be valid, requests must be submitted to us at <a href="mailto:info@oversee.net">info@oversee.net</a>.

<p><strong>Aggregated and Non-Personal Information.</strong> We may rent, sell, or share aggregated demographic information not specifically identifiable to you, and other non-personal information we collect, with any third parties for any reason, including to develop and deliver targeted advertising, and to conduct general business analysis. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our Site and the most popular features or Services accessed.</p>
<p>Please note that our Privacy Policy does not cover any third party's use or handling of your information once it is shared. Rather, the privacy policies of the various third parties will govern. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Links.</strong> This Site contains links to other websites, including through advertisements. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third party linked websites, even if this Site frames the linked third party website. We encourage you to be aware of when you leave our Site and to review the privacy statements of each and every website that you visit that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information we collect.</p>
<p><strong>Choice/Opt-Out</strong></p>
<p>We give our users the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our Site at the point where we ask for the information.

If you choose to receive communications from us but later wish to discontinue receiving communications or our Services, you can opt-out by any of the following means:</p>
<p>Send an email to: <a href="mailto:info@oversee.net">info@oversee.net</a>.<br> Send mail to: Oversee.net, Attn: Opt-Out, 515 S. Flower Street, Suite 4400, Los   Angeles, CA 90071.</p>
<p>Please note that opting out of receipt of promotional e-mail communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you will have to change your preferences directly with that third party. To opt-out of communications from our third party business partners, please contact them directly.</p>
<p><strong>Updating Your Information</strong></p>
<p>If you have questions or want to update your personal information, please contact us by email at: <a href="mailto:info@oversee.net">info@oversee.net</a>, or by mail at Oversee.net, Attn: Privacy, 515 S. Flower   Street, Suite 4400, Los Angeles, CA 90071.</p>
<p><strong>Information Retention &amp; Security</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Oversee.net stores your information for no less than one year from the time of initial submission, as well as automated personal information we collect about you. However, if we collect your social security number or credit card number we will only store that information for a limited time unless extenuating circumstances or the law require otherwise.</p>
<p>Oversee.net takes appropriate security measures to protect our users' information against unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or destruction. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as digital encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information. We restrict access to personal information to employees, contractors, and agents who have a "need-to-know" that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services, and who are bound by confidentiality requirements. We want you to feel confident using our Site to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.</p>
<p><strong>Visitors Outside the United States</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our Site from residents of the United States. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. If you are visiting our Site from outside the United States, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United   States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. By using our Services, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in our practices and Services. We reserve the right to modify it at any time, so please review it frequently. When changes are made to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share personal information that may impact you, we will also prominently post notice of the changes on our Site and/or we may notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an e-mail address or you have opted-out of such communication). Your continued use of our Site or Services after we have posted any Privacy Policy changes indicates your agreement to the changes unless you notify us otherwise.</p>
