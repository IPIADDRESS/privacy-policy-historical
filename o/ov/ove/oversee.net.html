When you provide personal information through our Site, the information may be sent to our servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.</p>
	<p><strong>User Provided Information.</strong> We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our Site or provide to us in some other manner. This includes identifying information (such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number), and any other personal information you choose to provide while using our Site or the Services.</p>
	<p><strong>Third Party List Information.</strong> We may also obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from third party data gathering sources. We may match this third-party collected information with the personally identifying information that you provide to us. When obtaining this information from third parties, Oversee.net seeks assurances form the third parties that it has the right to provide the information to us.</p>
	<p><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information Collection Technology.</strong> We use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our Site. For example, we collect and store non-personally identifying information through cookies, log files, clear gifs ("web beacons"), and third parties to create a profile of our users that details the users' viewing preferences.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><em>Log Files.</em> Technical information from your browser is automatically collected when you visit our Site. This information includes your IP address, your browser type, operating system, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see "Cookies" below), and the referring website address.</p>
		<p><em>Cookies.</em> A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's computer that tracks non-personal information about the user. When using our Site, we may assign your computer one or more cookies which enable us to improve the quality of our Service and to personalize your experience. Cookies allow us to automatically collect information about your activity on our Site, such as the web pages you visit, the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions you conduct while using our Site.

		<p><em>Web Beacons.</em> We, or our advertisers, may use standard Internet technology such as web beacons (or "clear gifs") and other similar technologies, to gather aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about your use of our Site. We also may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.

If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because we do not collect such information, we have no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. The Site targets an audience that is over the age of 18 and some content may not be appropriate for all ages.

Within thirty days of receiving this request, we will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed for direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of the third parties.</p>

For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our Site and the most popular features or Services accessed.</p>
	<p>Please note that our Privacy Policy does not cover any third party's use or handling of your information once it is shared. Rather, the privacy policies of the various third parties will govern.

These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.</p>
	<p><strong>Links.</strong> This Site contains links to other websites, including through advertisements. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third party linked websites, even if this Site frames the linked third party website. We encourage you to be aware of when you leave our Site and to review the privacy statements of each and every website that you visit that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information we collect.</p>
	<h4>Choice/Opt-Out</h4>
	<p>We give our users the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our Site at the point where we ask for the information. Please be aware that this may result in our not being able to provide certain services to you that require us to share information with third parties. If you choose to receive communications from us but later wish to discontinue receiving communications or our Services, you can opt-out by any of the following means:</p>
	<p>Send an email to: <a href="mailto:info@oversee.net">info@oversee.net</a>.<br>Send mail to: Oversee.net, Attn: Opt-Out, 515 S. Flower Street, Suite 4400, Los Angeles, CA 90071.</p>
	<p>Please note that opting out of receipt of promotional e-mail communications will only affect future activities or communications from us.

To opt-out of communications from our third party business partners, please contact them directly.</p>
	<h4>Updating Your Information</h4>
	<p>If you have questions or want to update your personal information, please contact us by email at: <a href="mailto:info@oversee.net">info@oversee.net</a>, or by mail at Oversee.net, Attn: Privacy, 515 S. Flower Street, Suite 4400, Los Angeles, CA 90071.</p>
	<h4>Information Retention &amp; Security</h4>
	<p>Oversee.net stores your information for no less than one year from the time of initial submission, as well as automated personal information we collect about you. However, if we collect your social security number or credit card number we will only store that information for a limited time unless extenuating circumstances or the law require otherwise.</p>
	<p>Oversee.net takes appropriate security measures to protect our users' information against unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or destruction. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as digital encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information. We restrict access to personal information to employees, contractors, and agents who have a "need-to-know" that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services, and who are bound by confidentiality requirements. We want you to feel confident using our Site to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.</p>
	<h4>Visitors Outside the United States</h4>
	<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our Site from residents of the United States. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. If you are visiting our Site from outside the United States, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. By using our Services, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.</p>
	<h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
	<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in our practices and Services. We reserve the right to modify it at any time, so please review it frequently. When changes are made to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share personal information that may impact you, we will also prominently post notice of the changes on our Site and/or we may notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an e-mail address or you have opted-out of such communication). Your continued use of our Site or Services after we have posted any Privacy Policy changes indicates your agreement to the changes unless you notify us otherwise.</p>
