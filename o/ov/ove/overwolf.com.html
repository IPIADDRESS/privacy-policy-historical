        <h4>What is Personal Information?</h4>
        <p>
              Personal Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a customer’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, or information about activities directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases. Personal Information also includes information that you may choose to provide to us, such as your educational, medical and employment history profile. 
        </p>
        <p>
             Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products or services you use or purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products and services used or purchased by others, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires. You understand that we may disclose and transfer aggregate information without restriction, on terms, including commercial terms that we may determine in our sole discretion. You acknowledge and agree that you are not entitled to any compensation relating to aggregate information or our commercialization or use thereof. 
        </p>
        <h4>

        </ul>
        <p>

Moreover, we require them to keep the information confidential and not to use it for other purposes. . Overwolf is not responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information to them.
