                    <h2>What is Personal Information?</h2>

                    <p>
                    Personal Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a customer’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, or information about activities directly 

                    linked to that person, such as his or her purchases. Personal Information also includes information that you may choose to provide to us, such as your educational, medical and employment history profile. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed.  In other 

                    words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the 

                    products or services you use or purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products and services used or purchased by others, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps 

                    understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires.  You understand that we may disclose and transfer aggregate information 

                    without restriction, on terms, including commercial terms that we may determine in our sole discretion.  You acknowledge and agree that you are not entitled to any compensation relating to aggregate information or our commercialization 

                    or use thereof.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Collection of Personal Information</h2>
                    <p>We collect Personal Information that you provide us, such as when you:</p>
                    <ul>
	                    <li>sign up for or renew your Overwolf membership;</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>
                    We may automatically collect some information when you visit our Site, such as your computer’s IP address, operating system, the site from which you linked to us, and the time and date of your visit, purchases and activities. We also

                    </p>

                    <h2>Use of Personal Information</h2>

                    <h2>Order Fulfillment</h2>

                    <p>
                    We may provide to a third party certain information that is necessary to fulfill an order you have placed with us.  For example, if you pay by a credit or debit card, your card number and sales transaction information is passed on to the 

                    card processor. However, we give vendors, suppliers, and others involved in the commerce distribution chain only the information they need to provide you the products or services you order, such as your name, shipping and/or billing 

                    address, email addresses, telephone number and product orders. Moreover, we require them to keep the information confidential and not to use it for other purposes. . Overwolf is not responsible for any additional information you provide 

                    directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information to them.
                    </p>
