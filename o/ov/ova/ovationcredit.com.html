				<h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>
				<p>Your information is safe and secure with Ovation. Protecting your 
				privacy is extremely important to Ovation. We guarantee to use the latest 
				technology and adhere to the most stringent confidentiality procedures 
				in the market to keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring 
				that you are aware of and understand the Ovation Client Privacy Policy, 
				we can provide you with better service. Please take a moment to read 
				the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information. 
				If you have any questions, concerns, or comments about the Ovation Client 
				Privacy Policy, please feel fee to contact us.</p>
				<h2>Our Company-Wide Commitment to Privacy</h2>
				<p>To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate 
				these privacy guidelines to every Ovation employee and staff member. 
				Ovation does not knowingly solicit personal information from children 
				or send them requests for personal information. Ovation's web site may 
				contain links to other sites. Ovation does not share your personal information 
				with those web sites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. 
				We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies. 
				If we are going to use your personal information differently from that 
				stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email 
				using the most recent information we have. If you have not given us 
				permission to communicate with you, you will not be contacted, nor will 
				we use your personal information in a new manner.</p>
				<h2>Privacy Safeguards We Use To Protect You</h2>
				<p>Ovation safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, 
				electronic, and managerial procedures.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Our website uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
					encryption wherever sensitive personal information is required</li>
					<li>Our servers are maintained in secure facilities behind the latest 
					firewall technologies.</li>
					<li>The login schema utilized in the online account access we offer 
					you utilizes the most modern and sophisticated approach to security. 
					Access requires usernames and passwords that employ a combination 
					of letters and numbers making the chance of unauthorized login virtually 
					nonexistent.</li>
					<li>To signup for service or to obtain account access one must also 
					use an SSL-enabled browser such as Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, 
					or Internet Explorer. This protects the confidentiality of your 
					personal information, and credit card or checking account information 
					while it is transmitted over the Internet.</li>
					<li>Our staff is granted only limited and pertinent access to the 
					information necessary to perform service on your account. Your data 
					cannot be transmitted or downloaded from our system by members of 
					our staff.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The Ovation Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. 
				We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes. 
				If you have any questions, concerns, or comments about the Ovation Client 
				Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us.</p>
				<h2>Ways You Can Help Keep Your Information Secure</h2>
				<p>We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data 
				when you are on the Internet. Here are some helpful tips to consider 
				whenever handling your important information with us or anywhere else 
				on the internet</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and 
					numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.</li>
					<li>Don't use the same password for different websites. 
					This way if anyone ever gets your password they will only have 
					it for one website.</li>
					<li>Never share your login information with anyone you would not 
					want to have full access to all of your information.</li>
					<li>Avoid login on any public computer or computer that is not solely 
					yours. If you must, be sure to logout when you are finished. Be 
					sure that there are no spyware applications installed on the machine 
					and empty all stored cookie or cache information.</li>
					<li>Notify us the moment you feel there has been a breach of privacy 
					or security on your end.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Why Do We Need To Collect Personal Information? </h2>
				<p>In order to provide the types of services we provide to you we must 
				collect certain necessary information in order to perform those services. 
				We collect personal information to enroll you in our service and to 
				provide our services for you. Once you have retained Ovation, we use 
				you personal information to correct inaccuracies, mistakes, and misleading 
				items on your credit reports. Additionally, we use your personal information 
				to provide you with superior customer service, and to communicate with 
				you regarding your case. We also use your personal information to keep 
				you up to date on the latest service announcements, feature updates, 
				special offers, and other information we think you would like to hear 
				about.</p>
				<h2>What Type of Information Do We Need To Collect? </h2>
				<p>The personal information that we collect is limited to the information 
				that you provide to us when you sign up for and use our services. This 
				information consists of your name, address, email address, phone number, 
				social security number, date of birth, and billing information. Additionally, 
				you will provide the information contained on your credits reports to 
				Ovation in order for us to provide our service. All personal information 
				that is provided to and maintained by Ovation is available for review 
				and edit directly through our online Client Access Center. Additionally, 
				you may contact us if you would like us to review and edit your personal 
				information for you.</p>
				<h2>How Do We Collect The Information We Need To Collect? </h2>
				<p>We collect information about you at the time you sign up for our 
				service, and any time we enter information from your credit report into 
				our database in order to facilitate your service, particularly for our 
				Dispute ManagerTM pages where you may continually update your information 
				and review the status of your case. All personal information our clients 
				provide is stored in a secure database for the sole purpose of rendering 
				our services to you. When you browse Ovation's web site, you are able 
				to do so anonymously. Generally, we don't collect personal information 
				when you browse - not even your email address. Your browser, however, 
				does automatically tell us the type of computer and operating system 
				you are using.</p>
				<h2>When Do We Disclose Information We Need To Disclose?</h2>
				<p>We maintain strict confidence of your personal information. The ability 
				to communicate with our clients during any part of the credit recovery 
				process is absolutely essential and, as a result, your personal information 
				may be shared internally with other Ovation employees. They will protect 
				your personal information in accordance with the Ovation Customer Privacy 
				Policy. Ovation works with other companies that help us provide Ovation 
				services to you, and we may provide your personal information to these 
				companies. For example, should we need to forward written documents 
				to you we give shipping companies this information so they can deliver 
				more efficiently. The information they receive is for shipping and delivery 
				purposes only, and we require that the companies safeguard your personal 
				information in accordance with Ovation's policies. Ovation will not 
				share, sell, transfer or convey your personal information to any unaffiliated 
				companies or third parties which are not necessary to perform our services 
				unless you specify otherwise.</p>
				<h2>Your Information Is Safe With Us</h2>
				<p>Ovation will not share, sell, transfer or convey your personal information 
				to any unaffiliated companies or third parties which are not necessary 
				to perform our services unless you specify otherwise.</p>

	<h3>Expect the Best from Ovation</h3>
	<p>Don't understand your credit report? Don't know what the numbers and letters 
	mean under the ratings section. Let us help you understand your credit report 
	a little better. Below are the numbers used to rate an account and the "R" before

	<ul>
		<li><b>R0</b> - Too new to rate. Approved but not used</li>
		<li><b>R1</b> - Paying as agreed</li>
		<li><b>R2</b> - 30 days late: Late more than 30 days, but less than 60</li>
		<li><b>R3</b> - 60 days late: Late more than 60 days, but less than 90</li>
		<li><b>R4</b> - 90 days late: Late more than 90 days, but less than 120</li>
		<li><b>R5</b> - 120 days late, but is not yet rated collections</li>

	summarizes your account status.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>R</b> - Revolving Account - A credit account that is charged and 
		once paid can be used over and over. A revolving balance.</li>
		<li><b>I</b> - Installment</li>
	</ul>
</div>
			<h2>Did You Know?</h2>
<div class="ColumnWithHeader">
	<p>Studies show that less than 10% of the population looks at their credit report 
	annually. Instead, they wait until they're ready to buy a car, make a real estate 
	purchase or refinance property and then check their credit report and credit 
	score. In some cases, this may be too late.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Twenty-five percent (25%) of the credit reports contained errors serious 
		enough to result in the denial of credit</li>
		<li>Seventy-nine percent (79%) of the credit reports contained mistakes 
		of some kind</li>
		<li>Fifty-four percent (54%) of the credit reports contained personal demographic 
		identifying information that was misspelled, long-outdated, belonged to 
		a stranger, or was otherwise incorrect</li>
		<li>Thirty percent (30%) of the credit reports contained credit accounts 
		that had been closed by the consumer but were reporting incorrectly</li>
