        <h2>Ovia Health Privacy Policy</h2>
        <h4><em>Last updated 12/21/2016</em></h4>
        <br>
        <h3>Introduction and scope</h3>
        <p>Welcome, and thank you for your interest in privacy at Ovia Health. Your privacy and trust are incredibly important to us. This Privacy Policy explains the data we collect and how we may use it. We realize that privacy policies aren't the most interesting things, but please read this one. We strive to make it understandable.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy, along with our Terms of Use, governs the terms of the relationshipbetween you ("you," our "user(s)," or "visitor(s)") and Ovia Health ("Ovia Health," "we," "us," "our"). You accept this Privacy Policy when you use our applications (including Ovia), products, website, content, communications, and services (collectively, the "Services"). Ovia Health may share information among our subsidiaries or sites that we own or control but the information is always protected under the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>If you do not agree to our Privacy Policy or Terms of Use, you aren't permitted to use our Services. Please do not provide us with any Personal Information that you aren't comfortable being used in the ways described here. "Personal Information" is information that may be used to identify, contact, or locate you, either by itself or when combined with other information.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time, and such amendment will be effective at the time we post the revised Privacy Policy on the site. You can tell when we last revised the policy by looking at the "last updated" date at the topof this page. Your continued use of the Services after we've posted a new policy signifies your acceptance of such.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Children's privacy</h3>
        <p>Our services are not intended for children under age 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information via the Services from users in this age group. We may, however, collect information about children and babies from their parents who are using our Services. The parent or guardian also assumes full responsibility for the interpretation and use of any information or suggestions provided through our Services for the minor. We ask that our users not provide information about a baby or child if they do not have guardianshipof the child, without first getting the parents' consent; accepting a user’s invitation to join a user’s application experience implies consent. We encourage parents to talk with their children about smart practices when giving out information online.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Other sites</h3>
        <p>As you use our Services, you may encounter information from or links to other sites. We have no control over these other sites, and thus we are not responsible for their privacy policies. Please review those sites' privacy policies separately.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>The data we collect</h3>
        <p><strong>Without registration.</strong> If you visit our website, we may record your activities, preferences, and transactional data (such as your IP address and browser type), as well as the content you view during your use of the Services. We may use this data (to the extent de-identified or aggregated) for any purpose unless we tell you otherwise in connection with a particular Service. While we may collect or log this information, we do not identify you individually with it.</p>
        <p><strong>With registration.</strong> If you register for any of our services, including the Ovia apps, we may collect certain Personal Information during signup, including first and last name, email address, date of birth, and zipcode. You may also choose to provide us with access to certain Personal Information stored by third parties including social media, such as Facebook, Google+, and Twitter. Because many of our Services give you content based on how long you've been trying to conceive or when your baby is due, we may also collect certain reproductive health info during signup, including height, weight, due date, baby's name or nickname, time trying to conceive, length of cycle, and date of last menstrual period.</p>
        <p><strong>Optional Personal Information you give us.</strong> Our apps give you personalized articles and feedback on your unique fertility, pregnancy and parenting journey using a combination of data that you record and our own algorithms. Because our Services get more fine-tuned and better with data, you may choose to tell us more about yourself at various times and places in the Services to experience these benefits, including MyQ questions, adding a photo of yourself to your home screen, daily health tracking, community features, and connecting a wearable fitness device to your account.</p>
        <p><strong>Aggregate activity information.</strong> To improve our Services and our business, we collect aggregate information about users. This information gives us a broad, high-level understanding about how people use our Services (e.g., which articles our users like the most, how many times people share their baby's hand size, and which moods are most common at certain days of users' cycles). Aggregate data does not contain any information that could be used to contact you, identify you, or associate any health condition with you personally. Aggregate data may include number of clicks, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, other browser history, mobile device and platform, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time.</p>
        <p><strong>Health provider information.</strong> We have partnered with some insurers and employers to provide additional health content and features on the Ovia apps. To access the additional functionality, you may be asked to provide your employer name, insurer name and ID, doctor name, or hospital name.</p>
        <p>When you visit the Services, we may also store information based on your usage history. This includes, but is not limited to, details of your transactions, content you viewed, click stream information, and cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account. We use various technologies to collect and store information which may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with the services offered by our partners, such as advertising services or Ovia features that may appear on other sites and in any other manner that we deem necessary for our business purposes.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How we protect and use your data</h3>
        <p>We keep your Personal Information confidential and do not disclose or use it, except in the following manner;</p>
        <p>Please note the following circumstances where either we or a trusted third party may use your data. In cases where partners are receiving potentially sensitive information, we require them to uphold our Privacy Policy and may require them to complete a security attestation so we can ensure that their data practices are sufficiently safe.</p>
        <p><strong>Customer support and troubleshooting.</strong> If you contact us with a question, our support team may view your data if doing so is necessary to solve your problem. We may also ask you follow-upquestions requiring additional information. Access to your Personal Information is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the employee to perform the function needed to resolve the issue or to improve the service.</p>
        <p><strong>Scientific research.</strong> At Ovia Health, we're looking for breakthroughs in reproductive health that will make people's lives better as they build their families. Both we and our research partners, including academics, reproductive health specialists, or medical facilities may use your aggregate data from the Services to conduct and/or publish this research. These findings could be used for scientific and/or medical abstract, journals, oral presentations, poster presentations, journalism, or internal usage to better the patient experience at facilities. For example, we might inform fertility practices that females aged 32-34 may ovulate and become pregnant more quickly than females aged 38-40. Depending on the circumstances and the goals of the research investigation, we may or may not charge third parties for this aggregate information. We require medical facilities and research groups whom we share aggregate information to agree that they will not attempt to make this information personally identifiable, such as by combining it with other databases. Information we share with outside researchers will be anonymous and not associated with your name or any identifying information you provided to us. By accepting Ovia Health's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, you give consent to third-party medical facilities and research groups to use the aggregate data provided on Ovia Health's website and related apps and tools. Ovia Health will not disclose Personal Information with the data.</p>
        <p><strong>Providing you the services you select.</strong> We may use your data in connection with and to better enable us to provide you our Services. We use various service providers to accomplish tasks like sending emails, tracking mobile appusage, or safely storing cloud data, and we share only the data that's required to carry out these services effectively and only to service providers who are bound to treat your information in confidence in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and applicable privacy laws. If you choose to use a feature of our Services that connects you with other users, you understand that you're sharing your profile information with those users.</p>
        <p><strong>Coaching. </strong>Some users will have access to additional features within the appas part of their maternity and family benefits provided by their employer or their insurer. One such feature is digital health coaching. If you contact our coaches with a question, our support team may view your data if doing so is necessary to respond to your inquiry. We may also ask you follow-upquestions requiring additional information. Access to your Personal Information is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the employee to perform the function needed to respond to your inquiry.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <p><strong>Emailing you about our Services.</strong> We'll contact you to inform you of important updates or changes about our products or features, our partners, this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or anything else newsworthy. At registration, you will automatically be signed upto receive these periodic informational emails. When you participate in certain services and activities, you will have the option of signing upto receive emails from Ovia Health as reminders or notifications. You can change these notification and reminder settings in the Settings section of our apps or from the footer of the email message itself by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email newsletter. Note that there are certain emails that you cannot opt-out of, such as an update to this Privacy Policy. These emails will be sent to you as long as you are a member of our Services. If you wish to no longer be a member of our Services, please send a request to us at <a href="mailto:support@ovuline.com">support@OviaHealth.com</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Sharing content with an Invitee.</strong> <strong>Sharing content with an Invitee. </strong>If you choose to use any features in our Services that let you share content with an ‘Invitee (as defined in the Terms of Use)(including your partner) to your health journey via emails or app based content, we may ask you for information such as their name, their email address, and their relationshipto you. We may use the Invitee’s email address that you provide to send them an invite to our Services, daily e-mails, your user health updates, sponsored promotions, and other communications. When you share the email address of an Invitee, you are doing so under the full knowledge that that Invitee will receive some of the Personal Information you have entered into the app. Additionally, that Invitee may be able to see and share content that you have added to the appincluding, but not limited to notes, messages, photos, personal health information and videos. Additionally, the Invitee may add additional content to the apps and may invite other users to become “Invitees.” Given this, be mindful of who you invite to the apps.</p>
        <p>If you do not want information shared with other people, you should not invite others. Once an Invitee accepts your invitation, he or she will be able to view and participate in all activity including viewing and adding data, viewing and adding content including notes, videos, images, etc., viewing and adding comments, viewing who has ‘hearted’ updates and ‘hearting’ updates, etc. Note, everything that you enter connected to the person whose health journey you are following, will be visible to everyone else following that journey. Do not share information you do not have consent and permission to share.</p>
        <p><strong>Names and Images. </strong>If you include a profile image and/or name for yourself or a child in your care, this profile image and/or name will be shared in emails to you and your Invitees, and Invitees that other Invitees invite. The image will be shared with the Invitee even before they have accepted the invitation. If you do not want the image and/or name to be shared, you should not enter a profile picture and/or a profile name.</p>
        <p><strong>Notification Feed. </strong>Other people who use our apps may have access to information that you or an Invitee shares. For example, if five people are invited to follow a health journey, all five will have access to information such as a photo, comment, milestone, video, health information, other similar information that one invitee shares.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Connecting you to your insurer, provider or benefits administrator.</strong>If, and only if, you voluntarily enter your insurer, provider, doctor, hospital and/or employer information, you acknowledge that your Personal Health Information may be disclosed without your written authorization to a HIPAA business associate – an organization that has legally committed to maintaining the privacy and security of your Personal Health Information - and as otherwise permitted or required by law to any of the aforementioned parties. Again, we will never share your Personal Health Information with these health care providers, administrators or insurers unless you explicitly enter the above information.</p>
        <p><strong>Connecting you with benefits. </strong>Some limited information about your activity in the apps may be shared with organizations that provide a benefit to you (such as an incentive program) for using the Ovia apps. For example, we may share that you logged in to the app or entered data in the app. We would not share the data that you entered with benefits companies.</p>
        <p><strong>Advertising.</strong> We may display ads in our Services, such as within Ovia's Timeline. These ads may be for our own products or services or for those of our advertising partners or affiliates. To understand how these advertisements are performing, we may share your information with third parties in an aggregate and anonymous format combined with the information we collect from other users. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of our Services and the activities they conduct while on our site (e.g., informing a pharmaceutical company that may or may not be an advertiser on our site that "30% of our users live east of the Mississippi" or that "25% of our users have tried alternative medicine"). Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this aggregate information. We require parties with whom we share aggregate information to agree that they will not attempt to make this information personally identifiable, such as by combining it with other databases.</p>
        <p><strong>Apple's HealthKit.</strong> If you choose to integrate any of your Ovia data with Apple's HealthKit, data obtained from HealthKit will not be sold to or shared with advertisers, data brokers, information resellers, or other third parties, even in the aggregate. Your HealthKit data will not be used for any purpose other than providing health and/or fitness services.</p>
        <p><strong>Refer a Friend. </strong>If you choose to send a link to download the Ovia apps to a friend, your friend will receive an email from your email address that has a link to download the Ovia apps. If you do not want your friends to know your email address or potentially that you are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are a parent, you should not send such a link.</p>
        <p><strong>Contests and sweepstakes.</strong> If you'd like to enter a promotion or contest we're running, we may ask you to provide Personal Information so that we can let you know if you won a prize. The specific rules and regulations governing the particular promotion or contest will vary, and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations.</p>
        <p><strong>Legal requirements for disclosure.</strong> We will not provide your information to law enforcement unless we are compelled by law with a valid court order, which is a much higher standard than the usual "permitted by law." Companies are not obligated to tell you when someone requests your data, but we will try and inform you so you can be aware and take legal action if you choose. You understand and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose any information we may have about you and the contents of your account if required to do so by law, which could happen if necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process (such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order), or to protect our rights and property. We may maintain copies of your content indefinitely for backuppurposes, even after you terminate your account.</p>
        <p><strong>Acquisition or change of ownership.</strong> We reserve the right to transfer your Personal Information in the event of a transfer of ownershipof Ovia Health or the acquisition of substantially all of our assets related to the business that collected such information, such as acquisition by or merger with another company (including an acquisition of less than all of Ovia Health's assets). In such an event where your Personal Information is transferred to a different legal entity, we will notify users who have provided email addresses when information about those users is transferred to a different legal entity.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Advertising choices</h3>
        <p>You can opt out of receiving email advertisements from us or our partners by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email newsletter, or you may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ovuline.com">support@OviaHealth.com</a> and we will manually unsubscribe you from anything you wish.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Security practices</h3>
        <p>We have designed our Services to protect data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, including using industry-leading data storage and protection service providers. However, no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free, so we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us. You use our Services at your own risk. Despite our efforts to protect your Personal Information, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your information over the Internet may be intercepted. If you provide your username and password to other people or if you use a public computer that does not log you off our Services, your data may not be protected. Please do not share your Ovia Health credentials and always log off public or shared devices.</p>
        <p>If we ever learn of a significant security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate steps to protect yourself. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice), you must notify us at <a href="mailto:support@ovuline.com">support@OviaHealth.com</a>. By using the Services or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Updating, accessing, or requesting deletion of your data</h3>
        <p>You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your Personal Information. For instructions on changing any of your privacy preferences, accessing your information, updating your information or for any privacy or data-protection-related question, please write to <a href="mailto:support@ovuline.com">support@OviaHealth.com</a>.</p>
        <p>If at any point you do not want your aggregated data used for research purposes, you must submit a written letter to Ovia Health's headquarters located at the address set forth below with this request. Ovia Health will have 60 days to respond to the request.</p>
        <p><strong>Limitations on removing or changing information.</strong> Upon receiving your request, we will delete your Personal Information in our Services from our active databases and, where feasible, from our backupmedia. You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to Ovia Health from our servers. We will not delete the posts or comments you've written and shared publicly, including on social media or in any Community or chat features.</p>
