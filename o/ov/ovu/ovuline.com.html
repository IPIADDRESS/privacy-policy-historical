<span class="SpellE">Ovuline</span> may provide Aggregate Information to third

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><br>
<b>Aggregate Information or Data:</b> As a website gathers individual pieces of
Non-Personal Information (see definition below) from its users, it may combine
similar data from many or all the users of the website into one big
"batch". For example, the site may add up the total number of people
in <st1:city w:st="on">Peoria</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">Illinois</st1:state>,
(but not their names) who are seeking information about weight loss and compare
that to the number of people in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Petaluma</st1:city>,
 <st1:state w:st="on">California</st1:state></st1:place> seeking the same
information. <br>
<br>
This sort of statistical information is called aggregate data because it
reflects the habits and characteristics of a large group of anonymous people.
Web sites may use aggregate data or share it with their business partners so
that the information and services they provide best meet the needs of the
users. Aggregate data also helps advertisers and sponsors on the Web know how
effectively they are reaching and meeting the needs of their target audience. <br>
<br>
<span class="GramE"><b>browser</b></span><b>:</b> Short for web browser, a
browser is a software application used to locate and display web (Internet)
pages. The most popular browsers are Microsoft Internet Explorer, <span class="SpellE">Firefox</span>, and Safari. In addition, most modern browsers can
present multimedia information, including sound and video, though they require
plug-ins for some formats. <br>
<br>
<b>Channel Partner Web site:</b> A third party Web site to whom <span class="SpellE">Ovuline</span> provides content and services for that web site's
health channel. <br>
<br>
<b>Cookie:</b> A small data file that is stored on the hard drive of the
computer you use to view a Web site. Cookies are placed by that site or by a
third party with a presence on the site, such as an advertiser and are
accessible only by the party or site that placed the Cookie (i.e. a Cookie
placed on your computer by <span class="SpellE">Ovuline</span> isn't accessed by
any other site you visit but a Cookie placed on your computer by an advertiser
may be accessed by any site on which that same advertiser has a presence).
Cookies can contain pieces of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). These
Cookies often are used to make the site easier to use. For example, if you
check a box to ask that we store your user name on your computer so that you
don't have to enter it each time you visit the site, it's stored in a Cookie on
your computer. <br>
<br>
<span class="GramE"><b>encryption</b></span><b>:</b> The translation of data into
a secret code. Encryption is the most effective way to achieve data security.
To read an encrypted file, you must have access to a secret key or password
that enables you to decrypt it. This is typically done by secure computer
systems. <br>
<br>
<span class="GramE"><b>firewall</b></span><b>:</b> A system designed to prevent
unauthorized access to or from a public or private network. Firewalls can be
implemented in both hardware and software, or a combination of both. Firewalls
are frequently used to prevent unauthorized Internet users from accessing
private portions of public networks. All messages entering or leaving the
network pass through the firewall, which examines each message and blocks those
that do not meet the specified security criteria. <br>
<br>
<b>Non-Personal Information:</b> Information that is not traceable back to any
individual and cannot be used to identify an individual. For example, Click
Stream Information is Non-Personal Information, as is information such as
gender, age, city and state when not linked with other Personally Identifiable
Information. <br>
<br>
<b>Opt-In:</b> Means you are actively indicating your preference to participate
in a program, email, feature, tool, or enhancement on a Web site. Typically, if
you "Opt-in" you must provide certain information, usually Personally
Identifiable Information, to the Web site or otherwise actively indicate your
choice or preference to participate in the Web site program. For example, if you
wish to use a tracker, you must select the tracker you want to add, enter in
information about yourself or your condition, and select how often you wish to
receive reminder notifications. Examples of opt-in emails include the <span class="SpellE">watchlist</span> and reminders to update your tracker. <br>
<br>
<b>Opt-Out:</b> Means that if you do not take some action you are indicating
your preference to participate in a program, email, feature, tool or
enhancement on a Web site. Typically, if you "Opt-out" you must
uncheck a box next to a stated preference or otherwise take some action to
indicate your preference not to participate in a program. For example, if you
do not wish to receive the <span class="SpellE">Ovuline</span> Newsletter or
emails notifying you that someone has invited you to be a <span class="GramE">friend,</span>
you must uncheck the corresponding box in your email notification preferences. <br>
<br>
<span class="GramE"><b>password</b></span><b>:</b> A secret series of characters,
typically alphanumeric (meaning it consists of both letters and numbers) that
enables you to access a file, computer, or program. You must enter your
password before the computer or system will respond to commands. The password
helps ensure that unauthorized users do not access the system. In addition, data
files and programs may require a password. <br>
<br>
Ideally, the password should be something that nobody could guess. In practice,
many people choose a password that is easy to remember, such as their name or
their initials. This is one reason it is relatively easy to break into many
computer systems. <br>
<br>
<b>Personal Health Information (PHI):</b> When your Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) is combined with known health characteristics. For example,
if you indicated that you have a certain disease or condition, when that
information is combined with your PII, it becomes Personal Health Information. <br>
<br>
<b>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (also called Personal
Information):</b> Information that can be traced back to an individual
(contrast with Non-Personal Information and Aggregate Information). Examples of
PII include your name, home address, telephone number, email address, and
Social Security number. If other pieces of information are linked to PII, they
also become PII. For example, if you use a nickname to chat online and give out
your real name while chatting, your nickname becomes PII when linked with other
PII. <br>
<br>
<span class="GramE"><b>server</b></span><b>:</b> A computer that provides
services to other computers. A "web server" stores web site files and
"serves" them to people who request them. <br>
<br>
<span class="GramE"><b>username</b></span><b>:</b> A name used to gain access to
a computer system or program. Usernames, and often passwords, are required in
shared systems, such as the Internet. In most such systems, users can choose
their own usernames and passwords. On <span class="SpellE">Ovuline</span>, as
part of your registration, you will be required to provide a username in
addition to your email and a password. The <span class="SpellE">Ovuline</span>
username is the name that will appear on any of your public forum postings.
Usernames are also required to post a reply on message boards, use certain <span class="SpellE">Ovuline</span> Tools and online services such as <span class="SpellE">Ovuline</span>. This public nickname should not include any
personally identifiable information, such as your name. <b>NOTE:</b> Once you
establish a username on <span class="SpellE">Ovuline</span>, you cannot change it
without registering with a new account. <br>
<br>
<span class="GramE"><b>virus</b></span><b>:</b> A program or piece of code that
is loaded onto your computer without your knowledge and runs against your
wishes. Viruses can also "replicate" themselves by copying their code
to other computers. All computer viruses are manmade. A simple virus that can
make a copy of <span class="GramE">itself</span> over and over again is
relatively easy to produce. Even such a simple virus is dangerous because it
will quickly use all available memory and bring the system to a halt. An even
more dangerous type of virus is one capable of transmitting itself across
networks and bypassing security systems. There are numerous virus protection
programs available. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
