        <h2>Ovuline Privacy Policy</h2>
        <h4><em>Last updated 10/07/2014</em></h4>
        <br>

        <h3>Introduction and scope</h3>
        <p>Welcome, and thank you for your interest in privacy at Ovuline. Your privacy and trust are incredibly important to us. This Privacy Policy explains the data we collect and how we may use it. We realize that privacy policies aren't the most interesting things, but please read this one. We strive to make it understandable.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy, along with our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, governs the terms of the relationship between you ("you," our "user(s)," or "visitor(s)") and Ovuline ("Ovuline," "we," "us," "our"). You accept this Privacy Policy when you use our applications (including Ovia), products, website, content, communications, and services (collectively, the "Services"). Ovuline may share information among our subsidiaries or sites that we own or controls but it is always protected under the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>If you do not agree to our Privacy Policy or Terms of Use, you aren't permitted to use our Services. Please do not provide us with any personal information that you aren't comfortable being used in the ways described here. "Personal Information" is info that may be used to identify, contact, or locate you, either by itself or when combined with other information.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We may amend or terminate any terms of this Privacy Policy at any time, and such amendment or termination will be effective at the time we post the revised terms on the site. You can tell when we last revised this agreement by looking at the "last revised" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Services after we've posted revisions signifies your acceptance of the changes.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Children's privacy</h3>
        <p>Our services are not intended for children under age 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information via the Services from users in this age group. We may, however, collect information about children and babies from their parents who are using our Services. The parent or guardian also assumes full responsibility for the interpretation and use of any information or suggestions provided through our Services for the minor. We ask that our users not provide information about a baby or child, if they do not have guardianship of the child, without first getting the parents' consent. We encourage parents to talk with their children about smart practices when giving out information online.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Other sites</h3>
        <p>As you use our Services, you may encounter information from or links to other sites. We have no control over these other sites, and thus we are not responsible for their privacy policies. Please review those sites' privacy policies separately.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>The data we collect</h3>
        <p><strong>Without registration.</strong> If you visit our website, we may record your activities, preferences, and transactional data (such as your IP address and browser type), as well as content you view during your use of the Service. We may use this data for any purpose unless we tell you otherwise in connection with a particular Service. While we may collect or log this information, we do not identify you individually with it.</p>
        <p><strong>With registration.</strong> If you register for any of our Services, including the Ovia app, we may collect certain Personal Information during signup, including first and last name, email address, date of birth, and zip code. You may also choose to provide us with access to certain Personal Information stored by third parties including social media, such as Facebook, Google+, and Twitter. Because many of our Services give you content based on how long you've been trying to conceive or when your baby is due, we may also collect certain reproductive health info during signup, including height, weight, due date, baby's name or nickname, time trying to conceive, length of cycle, and date of last menstrual period.</p>
        <p><strong>Optional Personal Information you give us.</strong> Our apps give you personalized articles and feedback on your unique fertility and pregnancy journey using a combination of data that you record and our own algorithms. Because our Services get more fine-tuned and better with data, you may choose to tell us more about yourself at various times and places in the Services to experience these benefits, including MyQ questions, adding a photo of yourself to your home screen, daily health tracking, community features, and connecting a wearable fitness device to your account.</p>
        <p><strong>Aggregate activity information.</strong> To improve our Services and our business, we collect aggregate information about users. This information gives us a broad, high-level understanding about how people use our Services (e.g., which articles our users like the most, how many times people share their baby's hand size, and which moods are most common at certain days of users' cycles). Aggregate data does not contain any information that could be used to contact you, identify you, or associate any health condition with you personally. Aggregate data may include IP address, number of clicks, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, other browser history, mobile device and platform, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time.</p>
        <p>When you visit the Services, we may also store information based on your usage history. This includes, but is not limited to, details of your transactions, content you viewed, click stream information, and cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account. We use various technologies to collect and store information which may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with the services we may offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Ovia features that may appear on other sites and in any other manner that we deem necessary for our business purposes.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>How we protect and use your data</h3>
        <p>We keep your Personal Information confidential and generally do not disclose it. We use the Personal Information that you provide in various ways described below. Please note that we do not sell your Personal Information to any third parties, nor do we share your information to social networks or other public places unless you explicitly tell us to do so (for example, by choosing to share your baby's growth on Facebook).</p>
        <p>Please note the following circumstances where either we or a trusted third party may use your data. In cases where partners are receiving potentially sensitive information, we require them to uphold our Privacy Policy and may require them to complete a security attestation so we can ensure that their data practices are sufficiently safe.</p>
        <p><strong>Customer support and troubleshooting.</strong> If you contact us with a question, our support team may view your data if doing so is necessary to solve your problem. We may also ask you follow-up questions requiring additional information. If you need support regarding a premium or subscription Service, your transaction may be conducted through our vendors and suppliers (for example, payments may go through the Apple App Store). Access to your Personal Information is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the employee to perform the function needed to resolve the issue or to improve the service.</p>
        <p><strong>Scientific research.</strong> At Ovuline, we're looking for breakthroughs in reproductive health that will make people's lives better as they build their families. Both we and our research partners, including academics, reproductive health specialists, or medical facilities may use your aggregate data from the Services to conduct and/or publish this research. These findings could be used for scientific and/or medical abstract, journals, oral presentations, poster presentations, journalism, or internal usage to better the patient experience at facilities. For example, we might inform fertility practices that females aged 32-34 may ovulate and become pregnant more quickly than females aged 38-40. Depending on the circumstances and the goals of the research investigation, we may or may not charge third parties for this Aggregate Information. We require medical facilities and research groups whom we share Aggregate Information to agree that they will not attempt to make this information personally identifiable, such as by combining it with other databases. Data related to the research study will be give an unique ID number, such that only Ovuline will have the ability to trace back to the user. Personal Information we share with outside researchers will be anonymous and not associated with your name or any identifying information you provided to us. By accepting Ovuline's Privacy Policy and <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, you give consent to third-party medical facilities and research groups to use the data provided on Ovuline's website and related apps and tools. Ovuline will use our discretion in sharing this information and will ensure to the best of our abilities not to disclose personal identification with the data.</p>
        <p><strong>Providing you the services you select.</strong> We may use your data for any purpose unless we tell you otherwise in connection with our Services. If you purchase a premium or subscription Service, your transaction may be conducted through our vendors and suppliers (for example, payments may go through the Apple App Store or Google Play). We use various service providers to accomplish tasks like sending emails, tracking mobile app usage, or safely storing cloud data, and we share only the data that's required to carry out these services effectively. If you choose to use a feature of our Services that connects you with other users, you understand that you're sharing your profile information with those users.</p>
        <p><strong>Emailing you about our Services.</strong> We'll contact you to inform you of important updates or changes about our products or features, our partners, this Privacy Policy, our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, or anything else newsworthy. At registration, you will automatically be signed up to receive these periodic informational emails. When you participate in certain services and activities, you will have the option of signing up to receive emails from Ovuline as reminders or notifications. You can change these notification and reminder settings in the Settings section of our apps or from the footer of the email message itself by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email newsletter. Note that there are certain emails that you cannot opt-out of, such as an update to this Privacy Policy. These emails will be sent to you as long as you are a member of our Services. If you wish to no longer be a member of our Services, please send a request to us at <a href="mailto:support@ovuline.com">support@ovuline.com</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Emailing your partner.</strong> If you choose to use any features in our Services that let you share include your partner in your health journey via emails, we may ask you for information like your name, your email address, and your partner's email address. We may use the partner's email address that you provide to send them daily e-mails, user health updates, sponsored promotions, and other communications.</p>
        <p><strong>Connecting you to doctors or your insurer.</strong> With your express permission, we can connect you to doctors or health specialists in your area and/or those who work with your insurance provider, or people at your insurance provider itself. These health care providers will receive some of your aggregate and/or Personal Information as it relates to your intake, treatment, and general statistics. Again, we will never share your Personal Information with these health care specialists or insurers unless you opt in to these additional services, which will be clearly marked and described to you.</p>
        <p><strong>Advertising.</strong> We may display ads in our Services, such as within Ovia's Timeline. These ads may be for our own products or services or for those of our advertising partners or affiliates. To understand how these advertisements are performing, we may share your information with third parties in an aggregate and anonymous format combined with the information we collect from other users. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of our Services and the activities they conduct while on our site (e.g., informing a pharmaceutical company that may or may not be an advertiser on our site that "30% of our users live east of the Mississippi" or that "25% of our users have tried alternative medicine"). Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this Aggregate Information. We require parties with whom we share Aggregate Information to agree that they will not attempt to make this information personally identifiable, such as by combining it with other databases.</p>
        <p><strong>Apple's HealthKit.</strong> If you choose to integrate any of your Ovia data with Apple's HealthKit, data obtained from HealthKit will not be sold to or shared with advertisers, data brokers, information resellers, or other third parties, even in aggregate. Your HealthKit data will not be used for any purpose other than providing health and/or fitness services.</p>
        <p><strong>Contests and sweepstakes.</strong> If you'd like to enter a promotion or contest we're running, we may ask you to provide Personal Information so that we can let you know if you won a prize. The specific rules and regulations governing the particular promotion or contest will vary, and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations.</p>
        <p><strong>Legal requirements for disclosure.</strong> We will not provide your information to law enforcement unless we are compelled by law with a valid court order, which is a much higher standard than the usual "permitted by law." Companies are not obligated to tell you when someone requests your data, but we will try and inform you so you can be aware and take legal action if you choose. You understand and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose any information we may have about you and the contents of your account if required to do so by law, which could happen if necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process (such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order), or to protect our rights and property, or that of our affiliates or the public. We may maintain copies of your content indefinitely, even after you terminate your account.</p>
        <p><strong>Acquisition or change of ownership.</strong> We reserve the right to transfer your Personal Information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Ovuline or the acquisition of substantially all of our assets related to the business that collected such information, such as acquisition by or merger with another company (including an acquisition of less than all of Ovuline's assets). In such an event, we will notify users who have provided email addresses when information about those users is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Advertising choices</h3>
        <p>You can opt out of receiving email advertisements from us or our partners by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email newsletter, or you may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ovuline.com">support@ovuline.com</a> and we will manually unsubscribe you from anything you wish.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Security practices</h3>
        <p>We have designed our Services to protect data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, including using industry-leading data storage and protection service providers. However, no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free, so we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us. You use our Services at your own risk. Despite our efforts to protect your Personal Information, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your information over the Internet may be intercepted. If you provide your username and password to other people or if you use a public computer that does not log you off our Services, your data is no longer protected. Please do not share your Ovuline credentials and always log off public or shared devices.</p>
        <p>If we ever learn of a significant security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate steps to protect yourself. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice), you must notify us at <a href="mailto:support@ovuline.com">support@ovuline.com</a>. By using the Service or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Service.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Updating, accessing, or requesting deletion of your data</h3>
        <p>You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your Personal Information. For instructions on changing any of your privacy preferences, accessing your information, updating your information or for any privacy or data-protection-related question, please write to <a href="mailto:support@ovuline.com">support@ovuline.com</a>.</p>
        <p>If at any point you do not want your data used for research purposes, you must submit a written letter to Ovuline's company headquarters with this request. Ovuline will have 60 days to respond to the request.</p>
        <p><strong>Limitations on removing or changing information</strong>. Upon your request, we will delete your Personal Information in our Services from our active databases and, where feasible, from our backup media. You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to Ovuline from our servers. We will not delete the posts or comments you've written and shared publicly, including on social media or in any community or chat features.</p>
