				<p>
				This Privacy Policy describes ooomf's policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information. ooomf receives your information through our various web sites, SMS, APIs, applications, services and third-parties ("Services"). For example, you send us information when you use ooomf from our web site, post or receive Tweets via SMS, create an ooomf landing page, or access ooomf. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country that you reside in or create information from, your information may be used by ooomf in Canada or any other country where ooomf operates.
If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hi@ooomf.com">hi@ooomf.com</a></p>
			

				<h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
				
				
				<p>We collect and use your information to provide and measure use of our Services and improve them over time.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Information Collected Upon Registration:</strong> When you create or reconfigure a ooomf account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. </p>
				
				<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong> You may provide us with additional information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, or a picture. You may customize your account with information such as your address book so that we can help you find ooomf users you know. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from these messages by following the instructions contained within the messages or the instructions on our web site. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Public Information:</strong> Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide to us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you post and the metadata provided with your App, but also many other bits of information. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For example, your public App is searchable by many search engines and is immediately reachable via SMS or email addresses to a wide range of users and services. You should be careful about all information that will be made public by ooomf. What you say on ooomf may be viewed all around the world instantly.</p>
	
				<p><strong>Location Information:</strong> You may choose to note your location in your ooomf profile. We may save exact coordinates to help improve our service. </p>
			
				<p><strong>Log Data:</strong> Our servers automatically record information (“Logging”) created by your use of the Services. Logging may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, and search terms. Other actions, such as interactions with our website, applications and advertisements, may also be included in Logging. </p>
				
				<p><strong>Links:</strong> ooomf may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services including third party services and clients by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. ooomf may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Third Party Services:</strong> ooomf uses a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide our Services, and to help us understand the use of our Services. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP request.</p>
				
				
				<h4>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h4>
				
				<p>We do not disclose your private information except in the limited circumstances described here.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Your Consent:</strong> We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as when you use a third party web client or application to access your ooomf account.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us. We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy policy.</p>

				<p><strong>Law and Harm:</strong> We may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect ooomf's rights or property.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event that ooomf is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:</strong> We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as the number of users who clicked on a particular link..</p>
				
				
				
				<h4>Modifying Your Personal Information</h4>
				

				<p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.</p>

				
				<h4>Changes to this Policy</h4>
				
				<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be available. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
				
				<p>Effective: May 2, 2012.</p>
