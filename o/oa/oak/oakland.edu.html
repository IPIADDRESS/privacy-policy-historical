              <br>
              At Oakland University, we strive to respect the privacy of our Web 
              site visitors because your privacy is important to us. Using the 
              Internet should be a fun experience, and we want to help you make 
              it enjoyable. This privacy statement describes what information 
              we collect and how that information is protected and used with those 
              ideas in mind.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Information 
              Gathered</font></b><br>
              Web sites you visit may gather information about you. Sometimes 
              you are asked to supply information such as your name, address or 
              e-mail address. Other times processes built into the Web site gather 
              information.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may ask you 
              for information to answer a request that you have submitted to Oakland 
              University. An example would be your name and address for mailing 
              admissions or employment information. Information sent to Oakland 
              University via Web data entry may be read, filed, stored, forwarded, 
              responded to or printed by Oakland University staff members for 
              the purpose of answering and tracking your request. In some cases, 
              the university may outsource the collection of information, such 
              as with admissions or employment applications, and your information 
              may be read, filed, stored, forwarded, responded to or printed by 
              employees of a third-party vendor providing services under contract 
              to the university.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You may be asked 
              to enter your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or 
              other information on an Oakland University Web site. This information 
              may be kept and used for future communications. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The university 
              may release your personal information to third parties under provisions 
              of Administrative Policies and Procedures. The Federal Educational 
              Rights and Privacy Act governs student data and information, and 
              usage of Web site information must comply with this law.</font></p>

              of Other Information</font></b><br>
              Most information we gather does not identify you personally. We 
              automatically collect information such as the type and identity 
              of the Internet service provider you are using, your Internet protocol 
              (IP) address, the time spent on the Web site, or the navigation

              Disclosure Cases</font></b><br>
              Oakland University may disclose user information in special cases 
              when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information 
              is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against 
              someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either 
              intentionally or unintentionally) Oakland University's rights or 
              property, other Oakland University users, or anyone else that could 
              be harmed by such activities. We reserve the right to use information

              customers or others. The university may disclose information when 
              we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</font></p>

              needed to complete a transaction history is stored on our secure 
              server. </font></p>
