<span class="paragraph">
Oaktree may also disclose your personal information to particular parties pursuant to your express consent, to fulfill your instructions, to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to fulfil other applicable requirements.<br>
<br>
Personnel employed by service providers generally may have access to your personal information for the purpose of performing duties for Oaktree but are prohibited from using such information for other purposes. <br>
<br>
Your personal information may be transferred to or shared with entities located in the United States, the European Union or in other countries which are deemed to offer an adequate level of protection, or in countries where data protection laws might not exist or be of a lower standard than in the European Union.  This includes the transfer of personal information among the Oaktree affiliated entities and the jurisdictions in which they operate. As of the date of this notice, Oaktree has affiliates within the European Economic Area (EEA), as well as affiliates in the United States, Dubai, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Australia (see the “Contact Us” page of this Site for a listing). In addition, we may transfer or share your personal information with non-affiliated parties located in the same jurisdictions as Oaktree entities as well as other jurisdictions (including India) and information may be stored and processed manually and electronically through global systems and tools for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
When transferring personal information from within the EEA to countries outside the EEA, we comply with European Union law by using Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or by adopting other means to ensure that adequate safeguards are applied (including, where relevant, transfers to a recipient with an appropriate Privacy Shield certification). If you would like more information on how we comply with transfer requirements please contact <a href="mailto:DataPrivacyTeam@oaktreecapital.com" title="DataPrivacyTeam@oaktreecapital.com" class="hyperlink">DataPrivacyTeam@oaktreecapital.com</a>.<br>
<br>
</span>
<h3>Safeguarding of Personal Information</h3>
<span class="paragraph">Oaktree maintains established internal policies and procedures as well as physical and electronic safeguards that comply with applicable standards to safeguard access to personal information in our possession from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized use or disclosure. We endeavor to limit access to personal information about you to those employees, agents and other authorized parties who need to know the information to enable Oaktree to provide products or services to you.  Please note that such safeguards, however, do not guarantee that personal information transmitted via the Internet or stored in our systems or is otherwise under Oaktree’s care will be absolutely safe from unauthorized use or intrusion from third parties due to the inherent nature of the Internet.<br>
<br>
</span>
<h3>Retention of Personal Information</h3>
<span class="paragraph">Personal information stored by Oaktree is generally retained for a period of ten years from (a) the date the data record was created or (b) a particular trigger event depending on the type of data record containing the personal information. Examples of trigger events are (i) the tax filing year in which an invoice for services received is paid, (ii) date of contract expiration or termination, and (iii) account closure or fund dissolution date.<br>
<br>
</span>
<h3>Your Rights</h3>
<span class="paragraph">The rights described in this paragraph are applicable to you only if you reside in a jurisdiction where the provision of such rights is required by the data protection and privacy laws and regulations of the governing regulatory authority.  As such, where required by applicable law or regulation, you may ask Oaktree for a copy of your personal information, to correct it, to erase it or to transfer it to other organizations. You may also have rights to object to some processing and, where we have asked for your consent to process your personal information, to withdraw this consent.  In particular, you have rights to object to direct marketing at any time.<br>
<br>
You should also be aware that these rights may be limited (for example, access to personal information may be denied if making the information available would reveal personal information about another person or if we are legally prevented from disclosing such information).  In addition, Oaktree may be able to retain data even if you withdraw your consent, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your personal information.  Where we must collect and process personal information in order to comply with applicable law or enter into and perform services under an agreement with you, if you do not provide the personal information we may not be able to enter into the agreement or provide services as contemplated by any agreement we have in place.  Where we are not able to fulfil a request you make because your rights are limited, we will inform you of the reasons as to why when responding.
<br>
<br>
Should you have any questions or requests in relation to your rights, please email <a href="mailto:DataPrivacyTeam@oaktreecapital.com" title="DataPrivacyTeam@oaktreecapital.com" class="hyperlink">DataPrivacyTeam@oaktreecapital.com</a>.  We will attempt to deal with all requests at the earliest opportunity. In addition, if you have unresolved concerns you have the right to complain, where permitted, to competent data protection authorities.
