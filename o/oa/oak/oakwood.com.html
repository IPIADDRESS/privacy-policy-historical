<h1>Oakwood Worldwide</h1><h2>Online Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>We are dedicated to protecting your privacy and safeguarding your personally identifiable information. We are committed to using our customers' information only in a responsible manner. We are committed to respecting your privacy and adhering to the principles of applicable data protection and privacy laws.</p>

<p>This Online Privacy Statement is an explanation of the information we collect, how we use it, and how the use of this information can benefit your experience on our websites and during your relationship with us. The information outlined below will assist you in making informed decisions while doing business with us.</p>

<p>In order to provide multiple access points to the services and products we offer, Oakwood operates directly, or through its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers, many websites, including <a href="http://www.oakwood.com">www.oakwood.com</a>, <a href="http://www.execustay.com">www.execustay.com</a>, <a href="http://www.childactors.ne">www.childactors.net</a>, <a href="http://www.oakwoodnewsletter.com">www.oakwoodnewsletter.com</a> and other websites listed here.</p>

<p>Oakwood is fully committed to providing you with information about the collection and use of personally identifiable information furnished by, or collected from, visitors while using its websites and services. Oakwood collects information about its customers and visitors to its websites so that it can provide an experience that is responsive to customers' and visitors' needs. </p>

<p><strong>Method of Collection of Information</strong><br>
Oakwood does not collect personally identifiable information when you browse the Oakwood websites unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide such information. This means that we will not know your name, your email address, or any other personally identifiable information just because you browse the Oakwood websites unless you:

</p><ul>
<li>access the Website from a link in an email that we sent;</li>
<li>are a myOakwood, eOakwood or eConnectivity member and log-in to your account; or</li>
<li>have created a profile and log-in when you access the Website.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>When we do need to collect personally identifiable information from you, we will ask you, your employer, your relocation company or travel agency to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our properties, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number and room preference to process your reservation. We may collect this information directly from you by telephone, fax, email, at the counter, upon completion of an application or enrollment form, or through your use of our websites. </p>

<p>Information may also be collected as part of: (i) fulfilling reservation or information requests, (ii) registering for myOakwood program membership, (iii) submitting a job application, (iv) submitting a credit application, or (v) responding to communications from us or our affiliates (e.g., surveys, promotional offers, or reservation confirmations), (vi) registering for, or responding to a subscription request for our newsletter. We endeavor to collect information only with your knowledge and with your permission if necessary. </p>

<p><strong>Types Of Information </strong><br>
The types of personally identifiable information that we collect may include your name, home, work and email addresses, telephone and fax numbers, credit card information, date of birth, gender, salary, social security number (in some instances), and lifestyle information such as room preferences, leisure activities, and other information necessary to fulfill special requests (e.g., health conditions that require special room accommodations). </p>

<p>Oakwood may also collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your use of our websites, communication preferences, travel habits, aggregated data relative to your stays, and responses to promotional offers and surveys. </p>

<p>You may be offered the choice not to submit your personal information or to decide what communications you want to receive from us. However, doing so may cause certain transactions to become affected. For example, not providing a name will prevent the processing of reservations. </p>

<p><strong>Use of Information </strong><br>
Oakwood will never sell your information to third parties or allow its use in any manner except with the purpose to ensure and promote the business relationship that you wish to establish with Oakwood. </p>

<p>Oakwood may disclose your information to others with that purpose in the following ways:

<p>Oakwood strives to keep all our customers and visitors informed and equally able to take advantage of the benefits offered by Oakwood and its strategic marketing partners. However, if you reside outside of the United States, certain data privacy regulations may require us to obtain your permission before we send you information that you have not requested from us. </p>

For example, Oakwood may collect and use personally identifiable information that you volunteer, or behavioral data or information collected in the aggregate. In addition, your permission will be deemed given for communications from us that are necessary to fulfill transactions and services that you request.</p>

<p><strong>Data Transfers Across International Borders</strong><br> 
The nature of our business and our operations may require us to transfer your information, including personally identifiable information, to other group companies, properties, centers of operations, data centers, or service providers that may be located in countries outside of your own. Although the data protection and other laws of these various countries may not be as comprehensive as those in your own country, Oakwood will take appropriate steps to ensure that your personally identifiable information is protected and handled as described in this Privacy Statement.</p>

Although we will make no more marketing use of information you have asked to be deleted, occasionally, information that you request to be removed will be retained in certain files for a period of time in order to properly resolve disputes or to troubleshoot problems.

<p><strong>Security </strong><br>
Oakwood recognizes the importance of information security, and is constantly reviewing and enhancing all technical, physical, and logical security rules and procedures. After information reaches Oakwood, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Oakwood. All Oakwood owned websites and servers have security measures in place to help protect your personally identifiable information against loss, misuse, and alteration while under our control. Although guaranteed security does not exist either on or off the internet, we safeguard your information using both procedural and technical safeguards, including VeriSign Secure Server ID. The use of VeriSign's services allows for the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption method used to help protect your data from interception and hacking while in transit. </p>

<p><strong>Cookies </strong><br>
Oakwood may use cookies, pixel tags or Web beacons to obtain information while visiting our websites. </p>

<p>A cookie is a very small text file that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. It assigns the computer with a unique identifier, which in turn, becomes your identification card whenever you return to an Oakwood website.</p>

<p>Cookies are designed to save you time because they help us provide a customized experience tailored just for you without having to remind us of your preferences each time you return to our websites. Oakwood cookies are not designed to damage your files, nor can they read information from other files on your computer hard drive.</p>

<p>Cookies also help us provide a personalized online experience in the following ways:
</p><ul>
<li>they remember your user name and password for future visits so log-in is easier and faster
</li><li>they ensure you are provided with the appropriate frames and content;
</li><li>they ensure you obtain all requested information; and 
</li><li>they help us deliver communications that are relevant and responsive to your interests and location. 
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p>Oakwood cookies are limited to our websites only, and are not designed to follow you when traveling on the internet after leaving Oakwood's websites. We track the usage of our websites in order to better meet your needs and to help make it easier for you to find information in the future. Please note that in addition to Oakwood cookies, various third parties may also place cookies on your computer's hard drive. Oakwood is not responsible for the presence or absence of third party cookies, or for the technological capabilities or practices employed by third parties in connection with third party cookies. </p>

<p>If you would prefer not to have the benefits of cookies, your internet browser or other third party software on your workstation can be adjusted to treat cookies in different ways. Depending upon the type of browser you are using, you may be able to configure your browser so that: (i) you are prompted to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis; or (ii) you may be able to prevent your browser from accepting any cookies at all. You should refer to the supplier or manufacturer of your Web browser for specific details about cookie security. However, you should also understand that rejecting cookies might affect your ability to perform certain transactions on our websites and our ability to recognize your browser from one visit to the next. </p>

<p><strong>Web Beacons </strong><br>

</p><p>Oakwood also uses pixel tags, sometimes called Web beacons, to count how many people visit certain Web pages. Information collected from invisible pixels is used and reported in the aggregate and does not contain personally identifiable information. Oakwood may use this information to improve marketing programs and content. </p>

<p>Oakwood and our email service provider also use pixel tags to: 
</p><ul>
<li>Track customer response to Oakwood advertisements and website content;
</li><li>Determine your ability to receive HTML-based email messages. Our email service provider includes a pixel tag, which they refer to as a coded sensor in all of the HTML-based messages sent on our behalf. The sensor activates when the email message is opened and flags the email address of the user as one that is capable of receiving HTML-based email messages. This capability helps our service provider to send the email in a format you can read. The sensor does not collect or use any other information. If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor;
</li><li>Know how many users open an email and allow our service provider to compile aggregated statistics about an email campaign for us; and
</li><li>Allow us to better target interactive advertising, enhance customer support and website usability, and provide offers and promotions that we believe would be of interest to you.
</li></ul>
