<li>in the event Oakwood is merged with or acquired by another company;</li>
<li>to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or obligations in accordance with applicable law or court order, and otherwise as we believe is necessary or appropriate to satisfy any law, regulation or other governmental request, to operate our web site properly, or to protect or defend our rights or the rights or well-being of our employees, users or others or if you are involved (or are suspected by governmental authorities or our security functions to be involved) in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order; or</li>
<li>in case of emergency such as to safeguard the life, health, or property of an individual.</li></ul>
<p>If information is shared as mentioned above, we will limit the scope of information that is furnished to the amount necessary for the performance of the specific function.&nbsp; We may confirm personal information you provide us on applications and forms, or as a resident of one of our communities, with third parties, such as your bank, employer, present mortgage company or landlord, utility providers, government entities, credit agencies, and other businesses where you have an account or a credit card.&nbsp; Unless otherwise precluded by legal process, we require third parties to protect your personally identifiable information and abide by applicable privacy laws and regulations.</p></div></td>

<p>Oakwood also uses pixel tags, sometimes called Web beacons, to count how many people visit certain Web pages.&nbsp; Information collected from invisible pixels is used and reported in the aggregate and does not contain personally identifiable information.&nbsp; Oakwood may use this information to improve marketing programs and content.</p>
<p>Oakwood and our email service provider also use pixel tags to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track customer response to Oakwood advertisements and web site content;</li>
<li>Determine your ability to receive HTML-based email messages.&nbsp; Our email service provider includes a pixel tag, which they refer to as a "coded sensor" in all of the HTML-based messages sent on our behalf.&nbsp; The sensor activates when the email message is opened and flags the email address of the user as one that is capable of receiving HTML-based email messages.&nbsp; This capability helps our service provider to send the email in a format you can read.&nbsp; The sensor does not collect or use any other information.&nbsp; If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor;</li>
<li>Know how many users open an email and allow our service provider to compile aggregated statistics about an email campaign for us; and</li>
<li>Allow us to better target interactive advertising, enhance customer support and web site usability, and provide offers and promotions that we believe would be of interest to you.</li></ul></div></td>
