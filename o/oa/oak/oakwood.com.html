          If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes

          Oakwood Corporate Housing requires Preferred Partners to ensure safeguards

          We carefully select these Partners to ensure your privacy and the value

          This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. 
          When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information 
          is protected both online and off-line.<br>
          <br>
          We use the <a href="http://digitalid.verisign.com/server/about/dataSheet.htm">VeriSign 
          Secure Server ID</a> to protect your billing information. Based on the 
          same technology used to protect nuclear missile codes, VeriSign Secure 
          Server IDs provide the strongest security available today. This technology 
          makes it safe to transmit your credit card number over the Internet.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          When our reservation form asks users to enter sensitive information 
          (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information 
          is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the 
          industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the 
          lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and 
          Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, 
          or open, when you are just ‘surfing. <font size="1">{<a href="#Top">top
