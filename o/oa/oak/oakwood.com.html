This means that we will not know your name, your email address, or any other personally identifiable information just because you browse the Oakwood Worldwide Websites unless you: </p>

<li>are a myOakwood, eOakwood or eConnectivity member and log-in to your account; or</li> 
<li>have created a profile and log-in when you access a Website. </li></ul>
<p>When we do need to collect personally identifiable information from you, we will ask you, your employer, your relocation company or travel agency to voluntarily supply us with the information we need.  For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our properties, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number and room preference to process your reservation. We may collect this information directly from you by telephone, fax, email, at the counter, upon completion of an application or enrollment form, or through your use of the Websites. </p>
<p>Information may also be collected as part of: (i) fulfilling reservation or information requests, (ii) registering for myOakwood program membership, (iii) submitting a job application, (iv) submitting a credit application, or (v) responding to communications from us or our affiliates (e.g., surveys, promotional offers, or reservation confirmations), (vi) registering for, or responding to a subscription request for our newsletter. We endeavor to collect information only with your knowledge and with your permission if necessary.</p> 
<p><strong>Types Of Information</strong><br>
The types of personally identifiable information that we collect may include your name, home, work and email addresses, telephone and fax numbers, credit card information, date of birth, gender, salary, social security number (in limited instances), password and security responses, and lifestyle information, such as room preferences, leisure activities, and other information necessary to fulfill special requests (e.g., health conditions that require special room accommodations). </p>
<p>Oakwood Worldwide may also collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your use of our websites, communication preferences, travel habits, aggregated data relative to your stays, and responses to promotional offers and surveys. </p>
<p>You may be offered the choice not to submit your personal information or to decide what communications you want to receive from us.  However, doing so may cause certain transactions to become affected. For example, failure to provide your name will prevent the processing of reservations. </p>
<p><strong>Use of Information </strong><br>
Oakwood Worldwide will never sell your information to third parties or allow its use in any manner except with the purpose to reasonably ensure and permit the business relationship that you wish to establish with Oakwood Worldwide. </p>
<p>Oakwood Worldwide may disclose your information to others with that purpose in the following ways: </p>
<ul><li>when we have received your written consent to do so; </li>
<li>when you voluntarily choose to include personally identifiable information in a publicly accessible area of a Website (e.g., public profile);</li>
<li>we may use "cookies" information and "automatically collected" information to:  (a) personalize our services, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Websites; (b) provide customized third party advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the Websites and third party marketing activities; (d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.  </li>
<li>when we communicate with employers, relocation companies, travel agencies, companies or organizations, who have made reservations, agreed to make payments, arranged for discounts, or purchased services on your behalf or if you use our services under a corporate or other commercial account; </li>
<li>if you seek to have your rental charges invoiced to your employer or any other third party, we may disclose personally identifiable data about you to that employer or third party and to any companies that assist the third party in processing invoices; </li>
<li>when we report to credit card issuers, credit reporting and fraud checking agencies and debt collection agencies, but only to the extent necessary to comply with contractual agreements; </li>
<li>if you choose to do business with us through, or with the assistance of, your employer's or any third party's travel agent, relocation company or other intermediary, we may disclose personally identifiable data about you to the employer or other intermediary to make, modify or cancel a reservation made by or with the assistance of the agent, to respond to questions or comments made by the agent on your behalf, to facilitate any other task that the employer or intermediary advises us that you intend for the agent to fulfill, or that such an agent would, as a matter of industry practice, typically fulfill; </li>
<li>in situations where sharing or disclosing your information is required in order to offer you services you desire, but only in the event we advise you of our intention to share such information; </li>
<li>when companies or service providers that perform business activities on behalf of Oakwood Worldwide require such information (e.g., credit card processing, customer support services, market research administration or database management services) </li>
<li>in the event Oakwood Worldwide is merged with, Oakwood Worldwide or its assets are acquired by, or Oakwood Worldwide acquires another company, in any of these circumstances, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from you, in connection therewith; </li>
<li>to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or obligations in accordance with applicable law or court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, and otherwise in our good faith belief that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to satisfy any law, regulation or other governmental request, to operate any Website properly, or to protect or defend our rights or the rights or well-being of our employees, users or others or if you are involved (or are suspected by governmental authorities or our security functions to be involved) in any illegal activity; or </li>
<li>in case of emergency such as to safeguard the life, health, or property of an individual. If personally identifiable information is shared as mentioned above, we will limit the scope of such information that is furnished solely to the amount necessary for the performance of the specific function.  We may confirm personal information you provide us on applications and forms, or as a resident of one of our communities, with third parties, such as your bank, employer, present mortgage company or landlord, utility providers, government entities, credit agencies, and other businesses where you have an account or a credit card.  Unless otherwise precluded by legal process, we require third parties to protect your personally identifiable information in a similar manner as set forth in this Privacy Statement, and abide by applicable privacy laws and regulations. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Use of Email</strong><br>
We will use your email address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, may use the other information to contact you for help in processing the reservation. We also may use your email address to: </p>
<ul><li>send you pre-arrival confirmation details; </li>
<li>notify you about special offers and promotions; </li>
<li>communicate emergency or crisis-related information;</li>
<li>send you copies of your bills when you request them; and </li>

You may also receive mailings or other communications from carefully selected partners, such as our referral partners or our customer satisfaction surveyors.  We may offer you the option to decline any or all of these communications by following the directions included in our emails or other communications, or by contacting Oakwood Worldwide directly. </p>
<p>Oakwood Worldwide strives to keep all our customers and visitors informed and equally able to take advantage of the benefits offered by Oakwood Worldwide and its strategic marketing partners.  However, if you reside outside of the United States, certain data privacy regulations may require us to obtain your permission before we send you information that you have not requested from us. </p>
<p>In some cases your permission will be implied from the nature of the service requested or transaction undertaken.  For example, Oakwood Worldwide may collect and use personally identifiable information that you volunteer, or behavioral data or information collected in the aggregate.  In addition, your permission will be deemed given for communications from us that are necessary to fulfill transactions and services that you request.</p>
<p><strong>International Visitors and Data Transfers Across International Borders</strong><br>
The nature of our business and our operations may require us to transfer your information, including personally identifiable information, to other group companies, properties, centers of operations, data centers, or service providers that may be located in countries outside of your own.  Although the data protection and other laws of these various countries may not be as comprehensive as those in your own country, Oakwood Worldwide will take appropriate steps to ensure that your personally identifiable information is protected and handled as described in this Privacy Statement.  </p>

Oakwood Worldwide uses reasonable methods to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.  After information reaches Oakwood Worldwide, it is stored in an encrypted format on secure servers that reside behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Oakwood Worldwide.  All Oakwood Worldwide owned Websites and servers have security measures in place to help protect your personally identifiable information against loss, misuse, and alteration while under our control.  Although guaranteed security does not exist either on or off the internet, we safeguard your information using both procedural and technical safeguards, including the use of a Network Solutions Certificate Authority. Oakwood Worldwide secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment.   When personal information (such as a credit card number, or other financial information) is transmitted through our website, it is protected through the use of encryption by way of a Network Solutions' service known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption method used to help protect your data from interception and hacking while in transit.  Oakwood Worldwide protects against unauthorized access of this data by using both technology and comprehensive security policies.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br> 
Oakwood Worldwide may use cookies, pixel tags or Web beacons to obtain information while visiting our websites. </p>
<p>A cookie is a very small text file that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's, or mobile device's hard drive. It assigns the computer with a unique identifier, which in turn, becomes your identification card whenever you return to an Oakwood Worldwide Website.</p>
<p>Cookies are designed to save you time because they help us provide a customized experience tailored just for you without having to remind us of your preferences each time you return to our websites.  Oakwood Worldwide cookies are not designed to damage your files, nor can they read information from other files on your computer hard drive.</p>
<p>Cookies also help us provide a personalized online experience in the following ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>They remember your user name and password for future visits so log-in is easier and faster</li> 
	<li>They ensure you are provided with the appropriate frames and content; </li>
	<li>They ensure you obtain all requested information; and </li>
	<li>They help us deliver communications that are relevant and responsive to your interests and location. </li></ul>
    
<p>Oakwood Worldwide cookies are limited to our Websites only, and are not designed to follow you when traveling on the internet after leaving Oakwood Worldwide's Websites. We track the usage of our Websites in order to better meet your needs and to help make it easier for you to find information in the future. Please note that in addition to Oakwood Worldwide cookies, various third parties may also place cookies on your computer's hard drive. Oakwood Worldwide is not responsible for the presence or absence of third party cookies, or for the technological capabilities or practices employed by third parties in connection with third party cookies. </p>

Depending upon the type of browser you are using, you may be able to configure your browser so that: (i) you are prompted to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis; or (ii) you may be able to prevent your browser from accepting any cookies at all. You should refer to the supplier or manufacturer of your Web browser for specific details about cookie security.  However, you should also understand that rejecting cookies might affect your ability to perform certain transactions on our Websites and our ability to recognize your browser from one visit to the next. </p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons</strong><br>
Oakwood Worldwide also uses pixel tags, sometimes called Web beacons, to count how many people visit certain Web pages.  Information collected from invisible pixels is used and reported in the aggregate and does not contain personally identifiable information. Oakwood Worldwide may use this information to improve marketing programs and content. </p>
<p>Oakwood Worldwide and our email service provider also use pixel tags to:</p>
<ul> 
	<li>Track customer response to Oakwood Worldwide advertisements and Website content; </li>
	<li>Determine your ability to receive HTML-based email messages. Our email service provider includes a pixel tag, which they refer to as a coded sensor in all of the HTML-based messages sent on our behalf. The sensor activates when the email message is opened and flags the email address of the user as one that is capable of receiving HTML-based email messages. This capability helps our service provider to send the email in a format you can read. The sensor does not collect or use any other information. If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor; </li>
<li>Know how many users open an email and allow our service provider to compile aggregated statistics about an email campaign for us; and </li>
<li>Allow us to better target interactive advertising, enhance customer support and Website usability, and provide offers and promotions that we believe would be of interest to you.</li></ul>
