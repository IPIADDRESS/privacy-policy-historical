		<h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
		<p>When you register on-line to receive our product information, you will need to provide us with your name, address and e-mail address. 
		When you make a purchase through Oakley’s website, you also will need to give us your telephone number and credit card number so we can 
		process your payment and contact you in the event of any problems with delivery. If you contact our customer service department, you may 
		need to provide us with additional information so that we can respond to your questions or concerns as completely and thoroughly as possible.</p>
		<p>In order to provide users and subscribers with the most efficient and enhanced service and to better understand your preferences, 
		we may request your gender, year of birth, sports of interest, shopping preference and product interest. Whether or not you provide this 
		information is entirely up to you. </p>
		<p>We also may collect additional non-personally identifiable information (for example, browser version, IP address) which will provide 
		information regarding the general use of our website. The navigational information allows us to see which areas of our website are most 
		visited and helps us improve the quality of your online experience by recognizing and delivering more of the most desired features and 
		services.</p>
		
		<h3>How We Use the Information</h3>
		<p>All personal information that we obtain about you will be recorded, used and protected by us in accordance with current data protection 
		legislation and this privacy policy. By providing us with your personal information, you consent to us processing this personal information 
		in one or more of the ways described in this privacy policy.</p>
		<p>We will primarily use your personal information to provide products and services to you, for example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To administer a contest, promotion, survey, market research, focus group or other site feature and to provide you with the relevant products 
			or services (for instance to deliver a prize you may have won in a contest).</li>
			<li>To send you information/materials via email or mail about products, offers and news we think could interest you. This information may relate to products, 
			offers and news of Oakley or Oakley Vault. We only send you this if you have opted-in to receive Oakley or Oakley Vault catalogs or emails messages.</li>

		the order, to confirm the order and to confirm shipment of the order. You may, upon placement of an order, opt to allow us to save your information for a 
		speedier checkout process the next time. This information is then stored only for the purposes of faster checkout and is not used for any other purpose.</p>
		
		<h3>Cookies</h3>

		browser settings. Please note, however, that by deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies you may not be able to access certain areas or features 
		of our website.</p>
		<p>We also work with other companies who use tracking technologies, including web beacons, to serve ads on our behalf across the internet. These companies 
		may collect non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our website about your interaction with our communications, including advertising 
		and e-mails. If you object to web beacons, we recommend that you follow the instructions for deleting existing cookies and disabling future cookies. We 
		will still know how many of our e-mails are opened and we will automatically receive your IP address, a unique identifier for your computer or other access 
		device but we will not identify you as an individual.</p>
		
		<h3>Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3>
		<p>Oakley and Oakley Vault will never sell any information about you to anyone. We are part of a larger company and we may share information with our parent and 
		affiliated companies.</p>
		<p>We engage third parties to perform services in connection with the operation of our business. Examples of these services include payment processing and 
		authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, product customization, order fulfillment and shipping, marketing and promotional material distribution, 
		website evaluation, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing. We may need to share personal information with these third parties so that they can 
		perform these services, however, we limit the personal information that we give to them and authorize them to use this information only for the purpose of performing 
		those services.</p>
		<p>In proceeding with your online order, you agree that both your name and address and those of the delivery name and address (if different) will be checked 
		using third parties such as credit agencies. If you are providing a delivery name and address which is not your own you must have that person’s permission to 
		give us their personal information and for us to use it for the purposes specified. By providing it you are saying you have their permission.</p>
		<p>We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our agents, including agencies or third party vendors so that they can provide marketing 
		analysis and consult on advertising strategies. This information does not identify individual users. We also may share non-personal information, such as the number 
		of users who visited the website during a specific time period or who purchased a specific product through the website, with our marketing partners, advertisers and 
		others from time to time. This information generally is shared in an aggregated form.</p>
		<p>We may release personal information if we believe in good faith that: the law or legal process requires it; if we have been advised by counsel; we have received 
		a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency; or such release is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Oakley, or any of our respective 
		affiliates, business partners, customers or others.</p>
		<p>As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we might go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, 
		sale of all or a portion of our assets or buying online stores or other assets. In such transactions, information about customers will likely be transferred. 
		You will be notified via a prominent notice on our site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. You will be deemed 
		to have consented to the transfer of your personally identifiable information to any such successor entity unless you notify us via email to the contrary within 
		the 30 day period.</p>
		<p>Personal information submitted to or collected through this website may be stored and/or processed in the United States, United Kingdom, Italy or Canada 
		for the purposes described in this privacy policy. By using Oakley and Oakley Vault products and services (including our website), you consent to any such transfer of information 
		outside of your country.</p>
		<p>We do not share, sell or rent to other third parties any personal information that you provide to us, except with your consent or as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

		<p>Oakley and Oakley Vault have a company policy not to flood people with e-mail correspondence, but simply give you periodic information so you can stay up to date on what 
		Oakley and Oakley Vault are offering.</p>
		<p>YOU can easily unsubscribe at any time you want by calling our customer service department at (866) 907-5708 or by following the instructions 
		contained in the e-mail. It takes some time to put opt outs in effect so you may still receive emails from Oakley or Oakley Vault for several weeks after your request is received.</p>
		<p>Oakley also uses your e-mail address to confirm your order and to confirm shipment of your order and to respond to any inquiries you make on-line. 
		All e-mails you receive will provide you with information as to how to get off the e-mail mailing list if you so desire.</p>

		(866) 907-5708 6am-7pm PST M-F and 7am-4pm PST on Saturdays.</p>
		<h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
		<p>If you are under 14, you should surf OakleyVault.com only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Although Oakley does not specifically direct its website, 
		catalogs or e-mails to children, Oakley strives to provide children with as much customer service as possible without violating their privacy rights. For 
		their protection, Oakley asks that anyone under 14 years of age not attempt to register with Oakley or otherwise provide Oakley with any personal information 
		without the consent of a parent or legal guardian.</p>
		<h3>Access to Your Personal Information</h3>
		<p>Oakley will provide you with access to the personal information you provided to Oakley by allowing you to view, update or correct your information. In order to 
		protect your privacy, Oakley takes steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the private information or enabling you to make corrections. Oakley 
		will accomplish this through the use of passwords and personal data.</p>
		
		<h3>Security</h3>
		<p>Our web site’s bunker security system is armed with a sentry system to monitor activity and prevent any unauthorized disclosure of credit card numbers or other personal 
		information. In addition, we utilize a licensed system for credit card authorization and fraud detection. We use industry standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to 
		protect the confidentiality of your personal information.</p>
