<p class="style3"><strong> PERSONS OR PARTIES COVERED </strong> This  Privacy Policy is intended to cover all visitors to this website,  all  subscribers to lists or newsletters whether paid or unpaid, all  members  or affiliates whether paid or unpaid, and all customers. Persons  who  visit or view this website, whether intentionally or  unintentionally,  whether solicited or unsolicited, are described herein  as "Visitors"  and are parties to this Privacy Policy. Subscribers to  lists or  Newsletters are referred to herein as "Subscribers" and are  parties to  the Privacy Policy. Persons who join an organization or  marketing  endeavor (e.g. "affiliates") promoted by this website are  called  "Members" herein and are covered by this Privacy Policy. Finally,   anyone who orders, attempts to order, or receives a product sold   (recipients) or advertised on or delivered from this website, even at no   cost, is called a "Customer" herein and is subject to this Privacy   Policy not only by passive acceptance, but by virtue of the Purchase   Agreement contract. The website, its agents, owners, operators, and   employees are referred to collectively herein as "Website," "Site,"   and/or "Seller".</p>
<p class="style3"><strong> PERSONS EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE ARE STILL COVERED </strong></p>
<p class="style3">In the event that a person excluded  from this website  because of the Terms of Use or from denial of service  by the website,  who nonetheless unlawfully views this site, that person  remains subject  to the terms of this Privacy Policy and is in violation  of the Terms  of Use.</p>
<p class="style3"><strong> PERSONS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE </strong></p>
<p class="style3">This  website is not lawfully  accessible to persons under the age of 18 or  who are otherwise covered  by the provisions of the Child Online Privacy  Act of 1998 (COPA). If you  are under the age of 18 you must leave this  site immediately.  Fraudulent use of this website may make you subject  to civil or criminal                 sanctions.</p>
<p class="style3"><strong> VIEWING AND/OR USE AND/OR COMMUNICATION IS CONSTRUED AS ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY </strong></p>
<p class="style3">Acceptance of the terms of this  Privacy Policy is a  portion of the consideration required for your right  to visit the  website. If you do not accept these terms, you have no  right to visit  this site and you are fraudulently using this site.</p>
<p class="style3"><strong> A NOTE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS (ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 --OPPA) </strong></p>
<p class="style3">It is the intent of the Privacy  Policy to comply with  the California Act. Various provisions throughout  this Privacy Policy  address requirements of the act. In summary, you  must presume that we  collect electronic information from all visitors.  This is not usually  personally identifiable. If you purchase a product  or service via this  website (and thereby become covered by the Act), the  purchase agreement  you electronically sign prior to purchase allows the  website to  collect and archive all the personal information you provide  and to  transmit and/or transfer that personal information to third  parties.  There is no way you can modify this information and you have no  right  to do so. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, you have no  right  to view or receive any information about our database. In the  event  that the website, under advice of counsel agrees to divulge   information, the requesting party must submit whatever information is   demanded by the website in insure that the website is releasing   information to the correct party. Other provisions of the OPPA may   exempt this website from complying. While we take measures to ensure   that outside parties do not have access to any information we have about   you, we do not warranty that outside parties will not breach our  system  and thus have access to your information. (You should know that   merchant service providers do not allow us access to your credit card   information.) This Privacy Policy also is subject to change without   notice. You are required to read it prior to using the website. By   interacting with the website you agree to the terms and conditions of   the Privacy Policy. By using the website or purchasing a product through   this website, you waive the right to use state or federal court  systems  to address complaints and, instead, agree to use the American   Arbitration Association located in a city and county specified herein.</p>
<p class="style3"><strong> ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED </strong></p>
<p class="style3">This website routinely collects  information about its  visitors, subscribers, members, and customers.  This information is  obtained in various ways, such as:</p>
<p class="style3"><strong> VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION' </strong></p>
<p class="style3">Registration means that the Visitor,  Subscriber,  Member or Customer takes active, positive steps to  communicate  information to this website. This can include pages or 'pop  ups' where  you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list;  it can  include your participation in visitor surveys; it can include   requesting information from the website via email, mail, or courier; it   may be from joining an affiliate program or other membership   organization, paid or unpaid; it may be from ordering a product.</p>
<p class="style3"><strong> ONLINE ORDERING </strong></p>
<p class="style3">Online ordering via SSL encrypted  communication  provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant  service  companies like Visa and Master Card provides information to the  website  but does not provide complete credit card numbers. In the  process of  online ordering, the customer provides, name, address, city,  state,  email address, phone number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and,   occasionally a member password. You should consider all this information   available to the website. This information is used to deliver the   product, but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for   general solicitation purposes.</p>
<p class="style3"><strong> VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES </strong></p>
<p class="style3">Website visitors who wish to  communicate with the  website do so under two conditions: one, they give  their permission for  contact by the website; two, they are subject to  any ‘submission’  provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or  this Privacy  Policy. While your email address may or may not be used to  solicit you,  it is added to the website's general solicitation database.</p>
<p class="style3"><strong> CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS </strong></p>
<p class="style3">If you are a customer and send an  email to the  website, or if you communicate with the site by phone or  mail, the  website collects information about your communication and by   communicating with the site you give your permission to collect,   archive, retrieve, and otherwise use any information collected as the   site sees fit.</p>
<p class="style3">Any communication which, in its sole  discretion, the  site deems to be a testimonial, may be publicized for  commercial  purposes.</p>
<p class="style3"><strong> INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS, OR SITE ADVE RTISERS </strong></p>
<p class="style3">Visitors clicking on banners or  pop-ups or  hyperlinked advertising, appearing on this website must  assume that  information is being collected about them. This site is not  responsible  for the use of information collected in such a fashion.  Visitors must  assume that (1) information will be collected, (2) that  ‘cookies’ will  usually be placed on their hard drive, (3) that website  does not have  any control over what happens with this information, (4)  that website  takes no responsibility over the accuracy or content of  advertisers,  (5) that website is not responsible for downloads from  third party  advertisers that contain viruses or worms or other computer  code that  causes their computer or software harm, and (6) that website  assumes no  responsibility for the data that is garnered from the click  itself or  that the advertiser collects.</p>
<p class="style3"><strong> INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM REFERRING EMAIL OR REFERRING URLS </strong></p>

You must assume that  referred emails or web  pages may appear to come from your email. You  must accept fully  responsibility for referring pages or email to a  friend and agree to  indemnify this site for any damage, intentional or  unintentional that  results from said referrals.</p>
<p class="style3"><strong> INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VOLUNTARY VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER OR CUSTOMER SURVEYS </strong></p>
<p class="style3">Unless otherwise specified in the  survey, you must  assume that any information provided to the website as  part of a survey  in which you participate may be used for general  solicitation for  commercial purposes and that such information will be  shared with joint  venture partners, affiliates, marketing organization  or used by the  site itself for product design or solicitation purposes.</p>
<p class="style3"><strong> INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ELECTRONIC MEANS AND 'COOKIES' </strong></p>
<p class="style3">Many websites, including this one,  collect  information about your computer, your email address, your IP  address.  You must assume that your web-viewing or web-use activity is  monitored,  tracked, and information collected. This information is not  usually of  a personal nature, but it may help define your viewing habits  and  product preferences even though the website may or may not have any   idea who you are.</p>
<p>"Cookies" is web jargon for  bits of computer code placed on your  hard drive. Websites use this to  keep you 'logged in', to keep track of  search criteria, to monitor use,  to password protect use of the site  or use of products sold by the site.  Cookies can also be used to obtain  information about your computer  configuration or your use of your  computer.</p>

This information may be used for  general  commercial solicitation by this website or other persons it is  sold to,  rented to, or shared with.</p>
<p class="style3"><strong> INFORMATION THAT IS NOT SHARED </strong></p>
<p class="style3">Credit card information or other  financial  information is not usually known to the website.

					<p>Next week I won't be here that much - although I'll still be writing you my daily email message. So, where will I be? I'm visiting a trade-show...not for the first time, and I don't think it will be my last either. If you've already started your eBay business, or are looking to start one, then they can be well worth a visit. Why? Simply because you'll find them 'chock' full of suppliers who can provide you with profitable products to resell. Whatever the niche. Sure, not every supplier will exhibit at trade-shows - but plenty do. This is ideal if you're looking at a certain niche. Let's say you're interested in selling beauty type products on eBay and online. Then there's a trade-show for that 'niche' (as for practically any other).</p>

					﻿﻿More devoted readers may remember that when I recently moved office, I couldn't find a decent sandwich shop around here...Well, that 'thinking' was based on the fact that the couple of places I'd 'spied' looked a bit ropey from the outside; the kind of place where they'd wipe their nose before buttering your bread. Anyway...that appears to have changed. See, one of the most run-down looking places actually produces a decent sandwich. I've been sampling their 'wares' for a week or so now. The result? I have already seen dust forming on my newly- purchased 'toasted-sanwdwich-making-machine'. Yes, dear reader...appearances can be deceptive! (I've just realised that I'm talking about sandwich shops again - for the second day running). Anyway - yes, appearances can be deceptive. It 'looks' like they'd produce a poor product - but actually, it's the opposite.

					<p>I'm reading a book at the moment - an  older one which I bought some time ago. I kind of 'glanced' at it when I first bought it, but as is usual with these things, I then usually go back and have another look (often about 6 years later). So, this one is called "The Profit Zone: How Strategic Business Design Will Lead You To Tomorrow's Profits" by a guy called Adrian Slywotzky. And although it focuses more on 'big' companies (such as Intel, Microsoft and Disney, amongst others), there are some good 'lessons' for everyone in here...including eBayers! Anyway - in the section on 'Intel', the author looks at how Intel has risen to become the World's #1 chip-maker. It starts decades ago...in fact, interestingly enough, back in the late 70's, Intel didn't make processors for PC's (like it does now) - it focused on making 'DRAM'...that's memory for PCs. What happened? Well, because of the (DRAM) market's huge growth, tons of competitors (mostly Japanese) jumped along for the ride. Eventually, that meant profits got watered down for everyone. Intel was faced with a problem: continue making sub-par profits in 'DRAM', or consider its alternatives. It decided to focus on processors instead - which, at the time, was a HUGE change for them. After all, they were memory-makers!

					Yesterday I mentioned the old 'starving crowd' story from the late Gary Halbert. I also hinted at using eBay Pulse. It can be a useful tool - but there are also some dangers involved in using it too, and I want to talk about those today. Now, let me first tell you two of the 'hottest' items currently being searched for on eBay (using eBay Pulse as a guide).
<p>- Iphone<br>- Nintendo Wii</p>
<p>Pretty hot, right?</p>
<p>They sure are - but here's the problem...Plenty of newbies - like lambs to the proverbial slaughter - come at those terms quite, shall we say, 'literally'...</p>

I’ve been fortunate enough to                have been featured in publications read in over 50 countries worldwide.                I’ve appeared on TV on more than one occasion, been asked                for radio interviews, even been on the front-page of the Daily Telegraph                – and more. <br>
<p class="list" align="left">I’ve also been filmed for eBay’s very own promotional                video, and have been asked to speak at their ‘Mastery University’.                <br> <br> Anyway, here’s a sample of some direct quotes from these articles.                If nothing else, hopefully they’ll illustrate that I know                what I’m talking about!</p>

					<strong></strong>eBay was not able to make it in Japan...There is a long list of reasons why (mainly involving Yahoo, who beat them to it) - but here's something interesting that I found out the other day...eBay is re-entering Japan - but not as eBay. They have forgotten that side of things and are JUST establishing Paypal there. They have forgotten the eBay side of things entirely! Usually, eBay will setup, er, eBay...then Paypal as well. The users of the site will then use eBay and obviously Paypal as well - and that grows the two businesses together. Not this time though. And this is an interesting point...You see, I know personally that different countries respond differently. And that can mean two things...
