This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any personal information that we collect from users of our Site, Applications and Services (collectively, the “<strong>Properties</strong>”) while providing such Properties to users on behalf of the Branded Company. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any websites, mobile applications or other online services that do not link to this policy.</p><p><strong>A NOTE TO USERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES</strong></p><p>If you are a non U.S. user of the Properties, by using the Properties and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed in the country in which it was collected, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your data, you acknowledge such transfer.</p><p><strong>THE TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p><p>Olo collects information from you in various ways when you access or use the Properties. We collect personal information from you in the following ways:</p><p>(a) <span class="underline">Personal Information You Provide to Us.</span> We collect the information you voluntarily provide to us. For example:</p><ul><li>We may collect personal information from you, such as your first and last name, e-mail, telephone number and password when you create an account (“<strong>Account</strong>”).</li><li>Our Services allow you to store preferences such as your location, recent orders and favorite menu items in order to make it more convenient for you to place additional orders in the future.</li><li>When you order menu items from the Branded Company on our Services, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name and payment information. We store this information on our servers, in order to make it easier for you to place orders for the Branded Company’s menu items in the future.</li><li>If you provide us feedback or contact us via email, we will collect your name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to send you a reply.</li><li>We also collect other types of personal information that you provide to us voluntarily, such as any information requested by Olo if you contact us via email regarding support for the Services.</li></ul><p>(b) <span class="underline">Personal Information Collected Via Technology.</span> We collect certain information from you automatically when you access and use our Properties as described below:</p><ul><li><span class="underline">Information Collected by our Servers.</span> To make the Properties more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including the referring/exit pages, your browser type, domain name, date/time stamp for your visit and your Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer or device when you use the Internet). We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Properties, monitor for fraudulent activities and for the efficacy of our fraud management tools, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs.</li><li><span class="underline">Cookies.</span> Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Properties. This type of information is collected to make the Properties more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.</li><li><span class="underline">Mobile Services.</span> We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have downloaded our Application. This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include your geographic location, how you use the Application(s), and information about the type of device you use. In addition, in the event our Application crashes our your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allow us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve performance of our Application. This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.</li><li><span class="underline">Third Party Analytics.</span> We use third party service providers to help analyze how users use the Properties (“Analytics Companies”). These Analytics Companies use Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the information we get from these Analytics Companies to improve our Properties.</li></ul><p><span class="underline">(c) Facebook and other Social Networking Services.</span> The Services may allow users to access Facebook and other social networking sites (each, an “SNS”) to interact with and share their experiences with the Branded Company’s products and services with their friends. If you are not a registered user of the Services, you can create an Account by clicking on “Sign In” using Facebook or another SNS that we support, and then entering your SNS login credentials. In this case, we may receive information from Facebook or another SNS to make it easier for you to create an Account on the Properties and show our relevant content from your Facebook and SNS friends. Once you register on the Properties and connect with Facebook or another SNS, you will be able to automatically post recent activity back to Facebook or the other SNS. Any information that we collect from your Facebook or other SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have with that SNS, so please consult the SNS’s privacy and data practices.</p><p><span class="underline">(d) Location Information.</span> If you have enabled location services on your phone and agree to the collection of your location when prompted by the Properties, we will collect your location information when you use the Properties; for example, to locate those restaurants and locations of the Branded Company that are near you or when you “check in” via the Properties. If you do not want this information collected by us, you may decline the collection of your location when prompted, or disable location services on your device.</p><p><strong>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p><p><span class="underline">(a) General Use.</span> In general, we use your personal information to respond to your requests as submitted through the Services, to provide you the Services you request, or to aid us in serving your better.
