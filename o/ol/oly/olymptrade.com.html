<ul> 
  <li> 
    <p>The first type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies a Client or other individual, or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (“      <strong>Personal Information</strong>”), which includes the following: 
    </p> 
    <ul> 
      <li> 
        <p> 
          <strong>Registration details</strong>: When you open an account and register to our Services, you will be asked to provide certain information to us. The information we collect through the registration process includes your name; phone number; e-mail address; full address, password, information about your currency and other information that we may need in order to provide our Services. 
        </p> 
      </li> 
      <li> 
        <p> 
          <strong>Identifying documents</strong>: As a precondition for performing transactions through the Services, you may be asked to provide certain identifying documents required by the Company as well as other information we need in order to obtain from you a proof of identity, proof of residence and proof of funds. Such documents and information may contain Personal Information, such as identification numbers, passport, tax registration number, etc. We may also collect Personal Information in order to evaluate your trading experience and to make an assessment about your risk factor. 
        </p> 
      </li> 
      <li> 
        <p> 
          <strong>Device data</strong>: We may also collect Personal Information from your device, such as geolocation data, IP address, unique identifiers (e.g. MAC address and UUID) and other information which relates to your activity through the Services. 
        </p> 
      </li> 
    </ul> 
  </li> 
  <li> 
    <p>The second type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a user(s), which may be made available or gathered via your use of the Services (“      <strong>Non-personal Information</strong>”). We are not aware of the identity of the user from which the Non-personal Information is being collected. 
    </p> 
    <ul> 
      <li> 
        <p> 
          <strong>Technical information:&nbsp;</strong>In order to enhance the functionality of the Services and to provide you with a better user experience, we collect technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information (e.g. the type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference, access time and the domain name from which you linked to the Services; etc.). 
        </p> 
      </li> 
      <li> 
        <p> 
          <strong>Analytics information</strong>: We collect information about your use of the Services, such as applications' usage, log files, user activity (e.g. pages viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, online browsing, clicks, actions, etc.), time stamps, alerts, etc. This information is collected for troubleshooting errors and bugs as well as for research and analytics purposes about your use of the Services. 
        </p> 
      </li> 
      <li> 
        <p> 
          <strong>Statistics</strong>: We may collect and share with other traders Non-personal Information which may include your basic statistics, the percentage of correct predictions you make in your trading history, most profitable asset, the best streak you ever had, etc. 
        </p> 
      </li> 
      <li> 
        <p> 
          <strong>Anonymous information</strong>: We may anonymize or de-identify the information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information cannot, on its own, personally identify you. Our use and disclosure of such aggregated or de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation and for any purpose. 
        </p> 
      </li>
