<p><br> <br> In the course of providing services to you, we may collect information that could reveal your racial or ethnic origin, physical or mental health, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or alleged commission or conviction of criminal offences. Such information is considered “sensitive personal data” under UKDPA and other data protection laws and as a special category of personal data under GDPR. We only collect and process this information where you have given your explicit consent, it is necessary, or you have deliberately made it public.&nbsp;<br> <br> For example, we may collect this information in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>For your safety, when you have a specific medical condition which might affect your ability to take a flight, or the accessibility of accommodation, or the availability or cost of travel insurance, you will need to inform us of that and –where required – provide us with medical evidence.</p>
<p><br> If you request special assistance to transit an airport, or on board an aircraft, this could reveal information about your health (for example if you ask for a wheelchair). If you inform us about specific dietary requirements you may have, this could potentially indicate that you have specific religious or philosophical beliefs. Also, when you provide us with your travel document details, your nationality may imply your racial or ethnic origin.<br> <br> By providing any sensitive or special categories of personal data you are explicitly agreeing that we may collect and process it as necessary in order to provide the services you have requested or booked and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br> <br> If you do not consent to us processing any sensitive or special categories of personal data (and you will need to make this clear to us when asked for such data), this may mean we are unable to provide all or parts of the services you have booked or requested from us. Please be aware that in such circumstances you will not be entitled to cancel any booked service (although we may be obliged to cancel or refuse to provide any such service) or obtain a refund of any price you have paid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
