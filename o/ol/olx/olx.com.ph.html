We have listed below some examples of the tracking technologies used on our Services:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4">Cookies. A cookie is a small data file sent from a website to your browser that is stored on your device. Cookies are used for a number of purposes, including to display the most appropriate content based on your interests and activity on our Services, estimate and report our Service's total audience size and traffic, and conduct research to improve our Services. You can configure your device's settings to reflect your preference to accept or reject cookies. If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to take full advantage of our Services.</li>
<li class="li4">Pixels. We may from time to time use certain <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/businesstools" target="_self">Facebook Business Tools</a>&nbsp;such as the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/742478679120153" target="_self">Facebook Pixel</a>. This tool allows Carousell to keep track of what users do after they see or click on a Facebook advertisement and enables us to monitor the effectiveness of Facebook ads for purposes of statistics and market research. Carousell will be able to better understand and deliver ads and make them more relevant to you. The collected data remains anonymous and Carousell cannot see the personal data of any individual user.&nbsp;
<p>However, the collected data is saved and processed by Facebook. Facebook may be able to connect the data with your Facebook account and use the data for their own advertising purposes and in accordance with Facebook’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_self">Data Use Policy</a>.

Facebook can connect this data with your Facebook account and use it for its own advertising purposes, in accordance with Facebook’s Data Policy which can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>.
