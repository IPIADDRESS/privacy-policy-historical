This is the web site of <b>Olan Mills,Inc.</b>

<p>Our postal address is:<br>
<b>Olan Mills, Inc.<br>
P.O. Box 23456<br>
Chattanooga, TN 37422</b><br>

</p><p>For each visitor to our web page, our web server automatically
recognizes the consumer's domain name and e-mail address (where
possible).</p>

<p>We collect e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail and information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.</p>

<p>The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web
page, used to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each
individual consumer, used to notify consumers about updates to our web
site, used by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes and not
shared with other organizations or commercial purposes.</p>

<p>When you access and interact with one of our websites, we may collect certain information often referred to as "clickstream data." Such data may include the type of Internet browser and operating system you are using, the pages and information you accessed on our site, the total time spent on our site, and the domain name of the website from which you linked to our site. Also, where you have previously identified yourself in the registration process as affiliated with a particular business or organization, we may record the fact that a representative of your business or organization visited the site, along with other clickstream data concerning that visit. Clickstream data will not be used to identify you personally and will not be associated or correlated with any site visitor in a personally-identifiable manner.</p>
<p>When you view one of our websites, we may store certain information on your computer. This information may be in the form of a small text file called a "cookie" and can help us improve your experience with our websites in many ways. For example, cookies allow us to tailor a website to better match your interests and preferences. Notably, our websites use cookies to help understand which parts of our websites are most popular, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there. Cookies are read only by the server that placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus.</p>

<p>Also, where specific programs associated with our websites require a user ID and password, you have the option of requesting that we save your user ID and password so that you will not have to re-enter that information the next time you access the website. This function is accomplished by the placement of a cookie. </p>

<p>With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. Please be aware, however, that some features and programs of our websites may be unavailable to you if cookies are erased or blocked. </p>

<p>Some uses of cookies in connection with our websites may be under the control of unaffiliated entities that we retain for the management of certain programs and fulfillment of specific visitor/customer requests. Olan Mills requires these entities to confine their use of cookies to the uses permitted by this Policy, but we cannot be responsible for third party uses of cookies.</p>

<p>With respect to Ad Servers: We do not partner with or have special
relationships with any ad server companies.</p>

<p>Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers online may receive
telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they have
placed online. They also may receive telephone contact from us with
information regarding new products and services or upcoming events.</p>

<p>We may disclose personal information you have provided through our websites to persons or companies that we retain to carry out promotions and other activities for which you have registered or in which you have otherwise asked to participate. We also will disclose personal information if required by law, including compliance with warrants, subpoenas or other legal process.</p>

<p>Olan Mills requires persons and companies to which we disclose personal information to restrict their use of such information to the purposes for which it has been provided by us and not to disclose that information to others. Olan Mills cannot be responsible, however, for any damages caused by the failure of unaffiliated third parties to honor their privacy obligations. Similarly, we are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites that are linked to our websites.</p>

<p>In addition to these limited disclosures of personal information, we may provide our affiliates or unaffiliated third parties with aggregate information about visitors to our sites. For example, we might disclose the median ages of visitors to our websites, or the numbers of visitors to our websites that come from different geographic areas. Such aggregate information will not include information of any individual visitors to our websites. </p>

<p>Olan Mills may provide personal and other information to a purchaser or successor entity in connection with the sale of the company, a subsidiary or line of business or substantially all of the assets of the company or one of our subsidiaries, affiliates or lines of business.</p>


<p>From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated
uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information
practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to
our Web site to notify you of these changes. If you are concerned about how your
information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.</p>

<p>If at any time you wish to discontinue any of the above listed services,

<p>All credit card information you provide stays with olanmills.com in

methods and fraud detection techniques to protect any and all information
you provide us.</p>

<p>We
always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and
receiving customer data exchanged with our online store. We have appropriate
security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the
loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our
site.</p>

<p>However, Olan Mills cautions visitors to its websites that no network, including the Internet, is entirely secure. Accordingly, we cannot be responsible for loss, corruption or unauthorized acquisition of personal information provided to our websites, or for any damages resulting from such loss, corruption or unauthorized acquisition.</p>

<p>Olan Mills takes seriously its obligations under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act concerning the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. Where appropriate, we will specifically instruct children not to submit personal information to our websites and/or will take reasonable steps to ensure that we obtain parental consent to such submission.</p>

<p>Parents should be aware that information that is voluntarily given by children or others in chat sessions, email exchanges, bulletin boards or the like may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited email or other contacts. We encourage all parents to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of the Internet.</p>
