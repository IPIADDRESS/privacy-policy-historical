					<h4>Information Related to Data Collected for our Customers</h4>

					<h5>Data Collection and Publishing</h5>

					<p>This Site collects no more data about you than most other websites. The information that the User introduces in his public gallery, as well as his public web albums are published, unless removed by you, will be a permanent part of this site. Please keep this information in mind when deciding whether to upload any content. </p>

					<h5>Service Provider Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information</h5>

					<p>When creating a profile or uploading pictures, a name and an email address will be required from our users. Generally, the information Olapic collects helps us to communicate with you regarding content that you have submitted through the Olapic Services. For instance, we may use your email address to provide you with an email confirmation of your registration or to notify you of the status of the content you have submitted. Furthermore, our Customers whose sites you have submitted content to through the Olapic Services, may use your email address to communicate with you from time to time. Olapic collects information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes.</p>

					<h5>Choice</h5>

					<p>We collect information for our Customers, if you are a User of one of our Customer’s site(s) and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Customers that use our Service, please contact the Customer that you interact with directly.</p>


					<h5>Access to Data Controlled by out Customers</h5>

					<p>Olapic has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their query to Olapic’s Customer (the data controller). If the Client requests Olapic to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 business days. </p>

					<p>When you visit the Site or interact with the Platform, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and Services, and for the Site's technical administration. </p>

					<h4>Additional Policy Information</h4>

					<h5>Cookies</h5>

					<p>Like many websites, we also use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site and Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. Olapic may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and Services. </p>

					<p>A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our Services and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. </p>

					<p>The use of cookies by our Customers, partners, affiliates, and service providers is not covered by our privacy statement.  We do not have access or control over these cookies. </p>

					<h5>IP Address and Clickstream Data</h5>

					<p>Our server may collect data about your server’s Internet address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you're on the Internet. When you request pages from our Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Your IP Address is used to help identify you and to gather demographic information about our customers as a whole, but does not include personally identifiable information. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another Web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Site; the Web site you visit after this Site; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Site or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Site. Such information may also be used to gather demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider. We may link this information with your personal information. </p>

					<p>Any or all of these activities with regard to Site usage information may be performed on our behalf by our service providers, including, for example, our analytics vendor(s) and our e-mail management partner(s). </p>

					<h5>Clear GIFs</h5>

					<p>We may use “clear GIFs” (aka “Web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, in the Site and/or in our communications with you to enable us to evaluate Site usage information about visitors to the Site, target campaigns, upgrade visitor information, and know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a Web page or message. A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page or email message to other information about you, including your personal information. </p>

					<p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  </p>

					<h5>Data Retention</h5>

					<p>Olapic will retain personal data and the data we process on behalf of our Customers for as long as needed provide the Services or to provide the Platform services to our Customers. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. </p>

					<h5>Data Release Policy</h5>

					<p>Our policy is to only release the data we collect in the following circumstances: </p>

					<ul>
						<li>To our licensees whose sites you have submitted content to.</li>
						<li>As required by law. </li>
						<li>To designated third parties to resolve or investigate abuse complaints. </li>
						<li>When the information is related to spiders or bots, usually when investigating technical issues.</li>
						<li>For abusive users, we may release information to assist in attempting to block the abusive user or to complain to that user's Internet Service Provider.</li>
						<li>If necessary to defend against legal claims. </li>
						<li>When we deem it necessary to protect the property or rights of the user community, or this Site. </li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Service Providers</h5>

					<p>We may use third party partners to help operate the Site and deliver our features and Services, and may share your information with our affiliates, service providers and other third parties that provide products or Services for or through this Site or for our business (such as Web site or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, job application processor partners, and other similar service providers that use such information on our behalf). When you sign up for our Services or provide information to us through the Site, we will share your personal information only as necessary for the third party to provide that Service.</p>


					<h5>No Selling of Information</h5>

					<p>We will not sell, lease or give your personally identifiable information collected via this Site or Platform (such as email address) to third parties except as otherwise explicitly stated in this Policy or with your consent prior to doing so. </p>

					<h5>Securing Your Information</h5>

					<p>Olapic is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. When you enter sensitive information (such as log in credentials) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  Although we employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we make no guarantee as to the security of your information or that your information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. If you contact us by e-mail or a “contact us” or similar feature on the Site, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit. If you have any questions regarding security you can contact us at <a href="mailto: privacy@olapic.com">privacy@olapic.com</a>.</p>

					<p>We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. </p>

					<h5>Social Media Features</h5>

					<p><strong>Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and&nbsp;may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. </strong></p>

					<h5>Testimonials</h5>

					<p>We post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our Site which may contain personally identifiable information. We obtain the customer's consent, wherever necessary, prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If you want your testimonial removed please contact us at <a href="mailto: privacy@olapic.com">privacy@olapic.com</a>.</p>

					<h5>Public Forums</h5>

					<p>Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto: support@olapic.com">support@olapic.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>

					<h5>Phishing</h5>

					<p>It has become increasingly common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information. Sometimes, the domain name of the e-mail address from which the e-mail appears to have been sent, and the domain name of the web site requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such sensitive information is received by an unauthorized individual to be used for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity is known as “phishing”. </p>

					<p>If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information (including your password or credit card information) via e-mail or to a Web site that does not seem to be affiliated with Olapic, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to us at <a href="mailto: info@olapic.com">info@olapic.com</a>.</p>
					
					<h5>Third Party Links</h5>

					<p>Our Site or Services may contain links to third party websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personally identifiable information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>

					<h5>Business Transfer</h5>

					<p>Olapic regards its databases of customer information (including personal information) as a valuable asset. In the event that Olapic is or substantially all of its assets are, acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, such databases containing personal information may be one of the transferred assets. In using the Site and Services you consent to such transfer of your personal information. </p>

					<h5>Our Policy Towards Minors</h5>

					<p>The Olapic Site or Services are in no way directed to persons under the age of 18 unless they have obtained parental or guardian consent. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto: legal@Olapic.com">legal@Olapic.com</a>. </p>

					<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of November 4, 2013. </p>
