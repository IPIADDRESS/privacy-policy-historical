<p>RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Olapic will retain Personal Information for as long as needed to provide the Services or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<p>SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>We disclose Personal Information in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>To our Customers on whose behalf we have collected Personal Information from or about an End User.</li>
<li>To our affiliates and subsidiaries, including those located in the United Kingdom and in Argentina, to meet business operation needs.</li>

</ul>
<p>We may use third- party partners service providers to help operate the Site and deliver our features and Services, and may share your Personal Information with those service providers and other businesses involved in the normal operations of our business (such as website or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, service providers such as companies which tag photos to products or otherwise analyze photos, job application processor partners, and other similar service providers that use such information on our behalf and under our instructions). When you sign up for our Services or provide information to us through the Site, we may share your Personal Information to those third party service providers only as necessary for the third party to provide the applicable service to us. These companies are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we share with them and to use your Personal Information&nbsp;<em>only as necessary to provide&nbsp;</em>these services to us.</p>

</ul>
<p>We will not sell, lease or give your Personal Information to third parties except as otherwise explicitly stated in this Policy or with your consent prior to doing so.</p>
<p>SECURING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.&nbsp; Nonetheless, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we make no guarantee as to the security of your information or that your information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. When you enter sensitive information (such as Customer log in credentials entered onto the Olapic dashboard), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). If you contact us by email or a “contact us” or similar feature on the Site, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit. If you have any questions regarding security you can contact us at&nbsp;<u>privacy@olapic.com</u>.</p>
<p>We will make any legally or contractually required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>
<p>COMMUNICATIONS FROM OLAPIC</p>
<p>If you opt in to receive marketing communications from Olapic, subscribe to our newsletter(s) or become a Customer of our Services, we will use your name and email address to send communications to you. If you no longer wish to receive these communications you can follow the unsubscribe instructions contained in those emails or contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@olapic.com"><u>support@olapic.com</u></a>.</p>
<p>We will send Customers communications about the functioning of our Services and similar service-related communications when it is necessary or useful to do so.

Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the social media company providing them.</p>
<p>TESTIMONIALS</p>

To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:%20support@olapic.com">support@olapic.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. Alternatively, if you used a third party application to post such information, you can remove it, by either logging into the said application and removing the information or by contacting the appropriate third party application.</p>
<p>PHISHING</p>
<p>It has become increasingly common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information. Sometimes, the domain name of the e-mail address from which the e-mail appears to have been sent, and the domain name of the web site requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such sensitive information is received by an unauthorized individual to be used for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity is known as “phishing”. If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information (including your password or credit card information) via e-mail or to a Web site that does not seem to be affiliated with Olapic, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to us at&nbsp;<u>info@olapic.com</u>.</p>
<p>THIRD PARTY LINKS</p>
<p>Our Site or Services may contain links to third party websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personally identifiable information from you. If you submit Personal Information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>
<p>BUSINESS TRANSFER</p>
<p>In the event that Olapic is or substantially all of its assets are acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, such databases containing Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets. In the event of such a transfer, Olapic will place a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.</p>

<p>When you download our mobile application and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and system and performance information.</p>
<p>We do not ask for, access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile application and the Services.</p>
<p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.</p>
