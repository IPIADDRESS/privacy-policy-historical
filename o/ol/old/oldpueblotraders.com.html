      To serve you better, we may combine the information you give us online, through our catalogs, 
	  and from our retail locations; publicly available information; and information we receive from others. 
	  We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your experience with us, to 
	  communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other 
	  promotional purposes.<br>
            <br>
       Also, we may contract with third-party service providers to provide certain services for our business, 
	   such as credit card processing, computer system services, shipping, data management, or promotional 
	   services. We provide the information needed for these service providers to perform these services. 
	   The information we provide may include some of our customers?| personal and personally identifiable 
	   information. However, these service providers are not authorized to use any of the information we share
	   with them for any purposes other than to provide services to us.<br>
	   <br>
	   
	   We may share information that we have collected with governmental agencies and other organizations 
	   assisting us in fraud prevention or for investigative purposes. We may do so when permitted or 
	   mandated by law; trying to protect against or prevent fraud; attempting to prevent unauthorized or 
	   improper transactions; or investigating fraud or improper conduct that has already taken place. In 
	   these instances, the information is not provided to these agencies or organizations for marketing or 
	   any other unrelated purposes.<br>
	   <br>
	   Additionally, we may share your e-mail address, name, telephone number, and postal address within 
	   the Charming Shoppes family of businesses. Also, when you purchase from us through our catalogs or 
	   Web sites we may need to contact you via phone, e-mail, or mail to address issues specific to your order, 
	   even if you have opted to not receive communications from us.<br>
	   <br>	
	   Finally, if some or all of the business assets of any Charming Shoppes company are sold or transferred, 
	   we generally would transfer the corresponding information regarding our customers and visitors to the 
	   purchaser. We also may retain a copy of that information.
