<p>Virtual Piggy, Inc. (“<strong>Virtual Piggy</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”) provides technology platforms designed for the management of the under-18 age group in the global online market. Virtual Piggy™ is an online system, provided by Virtual Piggy, Inc., that enables Parents (defined below) to control and guide youth through their online transactions and allows youth to make Parent authorized purchases from us and participating merchants.</p>
<p>We appreciate concern about online privacy issues and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose your Personal Information (as defined below). This Privacy Policy (the “<strong>Policy</strong>”) governs your use of any online service location (e.g., web site or mobile app) that posts a link to this Policy (each a “<strong>Site</strong>”) (including, without limitation, both mobile and online versions of our Sites), and also applies to your use of interactive features, widgets (e.g., the Piggy Pick), plug-ins, applications, content, downloads and/or other services: (i) that we own and control and make available through a Site; or (ii) that posts a link to this Policy (collectively, the “<strong>Service</strong>”), regardless of how you access or use them, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise, but does not apply to data we receive from third parties, except to the extent we combine such data with Personal Information that we have ourselves collected under this Policy. This Policy does not apply to our data collection activities offline or otherwise outside of our Service, unless otherwise set forth herein, nor does this Policy govern the collection, use or disclosure of information by any affiliate or subsidiary (collectively, “<strong>Affiliated Entities</strong>”) or by third parties.</p>
<p>Our Services include a Site that is directed to Children and teens, but not primarily those under thirteen (13) years of age, which is at <a href="http://www.virtualpiggykids.com" target="_blank">www.virtualpiggykids.com</a> (formerly <a href="http://myvirtualpiggy.com" target="_blank">myvirtualpiggy.com</a>) (“<strong>Youth Site</strong>”). As more fully set forth in the <a style="color:#F16312;" href="#children">Children’s Privacy Policy</a> at <a style="color:#F16312;" href="#children">Section 3</a> below, we age screen users who register for that Site and may restrict certain activities based on age as required by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<strong>COPPA</strong>”) in the United States. Our other Services are intended for a general audience (“<strong>General Audience Sites</strong>”), but as a best practice we age screen the registration process for them. Our General Audience Sites include <a href="http://www.virtualpiggy.com" target="_blank">www.virtualpiggy.com</a>,<a href="http://shop.virtualpiggy.com" target="_blank"> shop.virtualpiggy.com</a> and <a href="https://users.virtualpiggy.com" target="_blank">https://users.virtualpiggy.com</a> (formerly <a href="https://live.virtualpiggy.com" target="_blank">https://live.virtualpiggy.com</a>). Our Virtual Piggy mobile apps have both youth and general audience experiences.</p>

<p><a style="color:#F16312;" href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3>3. Children's Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We share Parents’ concern about the safety of children online. We comply with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<strong>COPPA</strong>”) and the new regulations implementing it, as revised effective July 1, 2013 (“<strong>COPPA Rule</strong>”), to the extent they apply to us and to our Services. We do not knowingly collect Children’s Personal Information (defined below) from children under the age of 13 (each a “<strong>Child</strong>” and collectively “<strong>Children</strong>”) if doing so requires verified parental consent under COPPA. We may collect from Children an email address of a parent, guardian or authorized adult (collectively, “<strong>Parent</strong>”) to provide notifications of a Child’s participation on the Youth Site, however, the notices include instructions to Parents on how to terminate the notices and delete the Parent’s email address and the Child’s account. Also, in connection with related customer service inquries, we may collect Children’s Personal Information from Children where verified parental consent is not required, subject to compliance with the COPPA Rule (e.g., to respond to an inquiry or request from a Child). “<strong>Children’s Personal Information</strong>” means personal information as defined in <strong>Section 312.2</strong> of the COPPA Rule.</p>
<p>We undertake a variety of ways to minimize collecting Children’s Personal Information from Children, and to avoid the need for our participating merchants from doing so in connection with a Child’s initiation of a proposed e-commerce transaction. Only a Parent may create a functional Virtual Piggy Account and fully activate a Virtual Piggy profile for a Child. Otherwise, the Child’s activities on our Youth Site are restricted to browsing content and engaging in activities that do not require verified parental consent under COPPA. A Parent who elects to create an account for their Child that permits more than such browsing, provides all Children’s Personal Information required to set up a Parent profile and account profile(s) of Children, including the Child’s Virtual Piggy User ID and Password. This way we are collecting such information from the Parent, not the Child, we can enable Parent controls and we can facilitate e-commerce transactions requested by the Child between the Parent and the merchant rather than between the Child and the merchant. Even after a Parent has set up a Child’s profile and account, a Child’s use of our service and participation and access to the Youth Site is not conditional upon his/her providing any Children’s Personal Information that requires verified parental consent under COPPA. Everything else necessary to facilitate merchant transactions comes from the Parent and the Parent can control what transactions can be facilitated by our Service. Youth, 13 years of age and older, may submit Personal Information themselves and may be able to activate a fully functional Virtual Piggy account without parental consent.</p>
<p>Our Youth Site is operated as a so-called mixed use site pursuant to Section 312.2 <strong>[LINK]</strong> of the COPPA Rule and we accordingly employ efforts to prevent the collection, use and disclosure of Children’s Personal Information from users who identify themselves as under 13 without first complying with applicable notice and parental consent requirements of COPPA. Without limitation, we do not make available to youth that we know to be under 13 years of age the ability to publicly post Children’s Personal Information on the Youth Site, including via third party social media plug-ins. We may, however, make such tools available to youth that represent they are 13 years of age or older. We also may provide youth, including Children, with tools to privately send an outbound-only message via the Service to their Parents, if their Parents have created a Parental account (e.g., transaction request message and wishlist submission). In any event, a Child’s use of Virtual Piggy and participation and access to the Youth Site will not be conditional upon his/her providing any more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary for them to participate in an activity on the Site. We do not share Children’s Personal Information knowingly collected from a Child with any third party, other than our service providers and agents necessary to provide the Service, except to the extent permitted or compelled by applicable law (e.g., to law enforcement or in connection with public safety). We may, however, share Personal Information collected from Parents (and youth 13 years of age and older) with third parties as otherwise set forth in the other Sections of this Policy.</p>
<p>Inquiries and requests regarding the collection, use, processing, sharing and transfer of Children’s Personal Information in connection with our Services, including to notify us that your Child may have submitted Personal Information to us without your consent, may be directed to us as set forth in <a style="color:#F16312;" href="#T15">Section 15</a> below.</p>

<h3>4. Types of Information Collected</h3>
<p><a name="T4A" id="T4A"></a></p>
<h3>a. An Overview of the Information We Collect and How</h3>
<p>Other than Children’s Personal Information, which is addressed separately in <a style="color:#F16312;" href="#children">Section 3</a> above, on the Service, we may ask you or a youth over the age of 13 to provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you and your family members personally, such as your first and last name, email address, phone numbers and home addresses (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”); and (2) demographic information, such as information about you and your Child/youth’s gender, your Child/youth’s age and potentially other information (“<strong>Demographic Information</strong>”). We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service, including account registration forms, contact us forms, or when you otherwise interact with the Service. To the extent we combine Demographic Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Policy.</p>
<p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Service (“<strong>Usage Information</strong>”). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “<strong>Device</strong>”) whenever you visit or interact with our Service. To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we may treat it as Personal Information.</p>
<p>This Usage Information may include:</p>

This Non-Personal Information is generally collected through the Service using various methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (“<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>”). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device. A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):</p>

<h3>7. Links and Third Party Sites.</h3>
<p>The Service may contain links to third party websites or online services. These linked locations (including, without limitation, the websites or online services of Affiliated Entities) are not under Virtual Piggy’s control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices, the contents of or any products or services sold from any such linked location. We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked location by Virtual Piggy. If you, a youth or your Child provide Personal Information through any such third party website or service, your transaction may occur on such third party’s location (not the Service) and the Personal Information you provide may be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of that third party. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties. For your convenience, the following link below may take you to a list of our participating merchants along with links to their privacy policies, which list may be updated from time to time: <a href="third-party-policies" target="_blank">http://www.virtualpiggy.com/third-party-policies</a>.</p>

<h3>8. Third Party Services.</h3>
<p>You may be presented with an option on our Service to receive certain information and/or marketing offers directly from third parties or to have us send certain information to third parties or give them access to it. If you choose to do so, your Personal Information and other information may be disclosed to such third parties and all information you disclose will be subject to the third-party privacy policies and practices of such third parties. In addition, third parties may store, collect or otherwise have access to your information when you interact with their Tracking Technologies, content, tools apps or ads on our Service or link to them from our Service. This may include using third-party tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or other third-party posting or content sharing tools. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third parties and, therefore, you should review such third-party privacy policies and practices of such third parties prior to requesting information from or otherwise interacting with them.</p>
<p>The Service may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and your account on a third-party web site or application. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us. For example, when you register with the Service, you may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third-party site or application to facilitate the registration and log-in or transaction process on the Service, or otherwise link accounts. If we offer and you choose to use this functionality to access our Service, the third-party site or application may send Personal Information about you to the Service. If so, we will then treat it as Personal Information under this Policy, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on our Service. In addition, we may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service. For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings. These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Policy. Virtual Piggy may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties. Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices. You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Service.</p>
<p>To the extent we permit such third party services to integrate with our Youth Site, we will require COPPA compliance in connection therewith for Children, as more fully set forth in <a style="color:#F16312;" href="#children">Section 3</a>. Older youth may be able to engage with such third party services via our Service without restriction.</p>

<h3>9. Third Party Advertisers.</h3>
<p>The Service may use third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and may use third-party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of the Service and viewing and serving of ads and of our content; provided, however, that we do not have third party advertising on the Youth Site. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your visits to the Service. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.</p>
<p>The Service’s third-party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies (including Flash cookies), web beacons and other Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier. These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.</p>
<p>Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they use our technology to help store or collect data. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third-party advertisers and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with the information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party’s terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.</p>
<p>However, some may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available here. Further, while we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the Service, you may wish to visit <a style="word-break: break-all" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer may be allowed under their own rules to deliver targeted content and/or ads to you, which may affect this and other sites, but does not mean you may no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Additional information is available on the NAI’s web site accessible by the above link.</p>

<h3>10. Data Security</h3>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information you submit to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or other digital media can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Once we receive your information, we use HTTPS encryption to transmit sensitive information such as credit card numbers and user ID and passwords. All Personal Information you provide for the Virtual Piggy Service is stored on secure third party infrastructure in accordance with their security procedures and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. User ID and password are used so that only the Parent can access and view the Personal Information and certain other Virtual Piggy account information and a Child’s User ID and password are needed to make a transaction using the Virtual Piggy Service. We recommend that you do not divulge and you inform your Children and youth that they not divulge Virtual Piggy user IDs and passwords to anyone. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your Virtual Piggy User IDs and passwords and Virtual Piggy shall not be responsible or liable in any way for damages or losses resulting from a Parent, youth or Child divulging or not protecting their user IDs and/or passwords.</p>
