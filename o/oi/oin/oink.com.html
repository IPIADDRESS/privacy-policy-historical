<h3>3. Account Creation for Children</h3>
<p>
We share Parents’ concern about the safety of children online.&nbsp; We comply with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<strong>COPPA</strong>”) and the new regulations implementing it, as revised effective July&nbsp;1, 2013 (“<strong>COPPA Rule</strong>”),<strong> </strong>to the extent they apply to us and to our Services.&nbsp; We do not knowingly collect Children’s Personal Information (defined below) from children under the age of 13 (each a “<strong>Child</strong>” and collectively “<strong>Children</strong>”), "Children's Personal Information" means personal information as defined in <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&amp;node=16:1.0.1.3.36#se16.1.312_12">Section 312.2</a> of the COPPA Rule. In order to set up a Sub Account for a child, we collect information about the child from a parent, guardian or authorized adult (collectively, "<strong>Parent</strong>"). This information includes the Child's first and last name, a username and password, date of birth, and gender. Parents can learn how to change or delete their information or their Child's information in <a href="#T11" style="color:#F16312;">Section 11</a> on "Changing and Deleting Information". If it is discovered that we have collected information from a Child, we will delete the Child's information.</p>
<p>
Only a Parent may fully activate a Sub Account (defined in Section 4 below) and fully activate a Virtual Piggy profile for a Child.&nbsp; This way we are collecting such information from the Parent, not the Child, we can enable Parent controls and we can facilitate e-commerce transactions requested by the Child between the Parent and the merchant rather than between the Child and the merchant. Even after a Parent has set up a Child’s profile and account, a Child’s use of our Service and participation and access to the Sites is not conditional upon his/her providing any Children’s Personal Information that requires verified parental consent under COPPA.&nbsp; Everything else necessary to facilitate merchant transactions comes from the Parent and the Parent can control what transactions can be facilitated by our Service.&nbsp; Youth, 13 years of age and older, may submit Personal Information themselves and may be able to activate a fully functional Oink account without parental consent.</p>
<p>We also provide Youth and Children with tools to privately send an outbound-only message via the Service to their Parents, if their Parents have created a Primary Account (defined below) (e.g., transaction request message and wishlist submission).&nbsp; We do not share Children’s Personal Information with any third party, other than our service providers and agents necessary to provide the Service, except to the extent permitted or compelled by applicable law (e.g., to law enforcement or in connection with public safety) or as otherwise set forth in the other Sections of this Policy.</p>
<p>We collect the following Non-Personal Information from Youth and Children when they use the Wishlist functionality via our Service: the URL for the merchant site and the particular products, services, games or other items they wish to purchase from the merchant using the Service, including a description and price of the item.&nbsp; We may also allow Youth and Children to include a personalized message with a variety of requests to the Parent (such as, store permissions, funding options, shopping preferences, goals and Wishlist) where such requests and message are for the Parent’s benefit and not publicly available.</p>
<p>
Inquiries and requests regarding the collection, use, processing, sharing and transfer of Children’s Personal Information in connection with our Services, including to notify us that your Child may have submitted Personal Information to us without your consent, may be directed to us as set forth in <a href="#T15" style="color:#F16312;">Section 15</a> below.</p>

<h3>4. Types of Information Collected</h3>
<p><a name="T4A" id="T4A"></a></p>
<h3>a. An Overview of the Information We Collect and How</h3>
<p>Only individuals thirteen (13) years of age and above (“Individuals”) should create a functional Primary Oink Account (“<strong>Primary Account</strong>”), and only Parents may create profiles for Youth and Children (“<strong>Sub Accounts</strong>”). As a Primary Account holder on the Service, we ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you and your family members personally, including your first and last name, email address, phone numbers and home addresses (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”); and (2) demographic information, including information about you and your family member’s gender, age, and potentially other information that cannot be used alone to directly identify and contact you (“<strong>Demographic Information</strong>”).&nbsp; Further, we may ask Sub Account holders over the age of thirteen (13) for Personal Information. We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service, including account registration forms, contact us forms, or when you otherwise interact with the Service.&nbsp; To the extent we combine Demographic Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Policy.</p>
<p>
In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Service (“<strong>Usage Information</strong>”). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “<strong>Device</strong>”) whenever you visit or interact with our Service. To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we may treat it as Personal Information.</p>
<p>
This Usage Information may include:</p>
<ul><li>your IP address, UDID, or other unique identifier (collectively “<strong>Device Identifiers</strong>”).&nbsp; A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Service, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Please note that, under the amended COPPA Rule, Device Identifiers fall under the category of Personal Information;</li>
<li style="color: #575757">your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);</li>
<li style="color: #575757">the URL that referred you to our Service;</li>

<li style="color: #575757">your Device characteristics; and</li>
<li style="color: #575757">certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.</li>
</ul><p>Excluding Device Identifiers and exact Device location, Demographic Information and Usage Information are collectively “<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>”, except to the extent combined with Personal Information.</p>
<p>When you visit and interact with the Service, Virtual Piggy and its third party service providers may also collect other Non-Personal Information (for example, a catalog of the Site pages you visit). This Non-Personal Information is generally collected through the Service using various methods and technologies to store or collect information (“<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>”). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device. A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):</p>
<ul><li style="color: #575757">Server Log Files. Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. IP addresses may be used for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site’s servers, and administering the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.</li>

Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they use our technology to help store or collect data. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third-party advertisers and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with the information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice.

<h3>10. Data Security</h3>
<p>
The security of your Personal Information is important to us.&nbsp; We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information you submit to us.&nbsp; Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or other digital media can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp; Once we receive your information, we use HTTPS encryption to transmit sensitive information such as credit card numbers and user ID and passwords.&nbsp; All Personal Information you provide for the Oink Service is stored on secure third party infrastructure in accordance with their security procedures and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.&nbsp; User ID and password are used to access and view the Personal Information and certain other Oink account information as well as to make a transaction using the Oink Service.&nbsp; We recommend that you do not divulge and you inform your Sub Account holders, if any, that they not divulge Oink user IDs and passwords to anyone.&nbsp; Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your Oink User IDs and passwords and Virtual Piggy shall not be responsible or liable in any way for damages or losses resulting from a Primary or Sub Account holder divulging or not protecting their user IDs and/or passwords.</p>
