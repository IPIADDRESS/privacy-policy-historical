Changes in this Privacy Policy</h3><p><br>From time to time, we may need to change our Policy because of changes in the law, technology, our business, or our attempts to better serve user needs. If we decide to change our Policy, we may post the changes within the Policy itself, with an alert on the homepage or in other places we deem appropriate. If we change how we use your Personal Information, we may notify you here, by email, internal message system or by means of a notice on our homepage. We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. All information collected after any updates to the Policy may be subject to the new policy; provided, however, that Personal Information collected under a prior version of the Policy may not be used in a way materially different than allowed under the version of the Policy in effect at the time the data was collected unless you consent.</p> <p><a name="children"></a></p><p><a style="color:#F16312;" href="#top">Back to Top</a></p> <h3>3. Children's Privacy Policy</h3><p><br>
We share Parents’ concern about the safety of children online.&nbsp; We comply with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<strong>COPPA</strong>”) and the new regulations implementing it, as revised effective July&nbsp;1, 2013 (“<strong>COPPA Rule</strong>”),<strong> </strong>to the extent they apply to us and to our Services.&nbsp; We do not knowingly collect Children’s Personal Information (defined below) from children under the age of 13 (each a “<strong>Child</strong>” and collectively “<strong>Children</strong>”) if doing so requires verified parental consent under COPPA.&nbsp; We may collect from Children an email address of a parent, guardian or authorized adult (collectively, “<strong>Parent</strong>”) to provide notifications of a Child’s participation on the Youth Site, however, the notices include instructions to the Parent on how to terminate the notices and delete the Parent’s email address and the Child’s account.&nbsp; Also, in connection with related customer service inquiries, we may collect Children’s Personal Information from Children where verified parental consent is not required, subject to compliance with the COPPA Rule (e.g., to respond to an inquiry or request from a Child).&nbsp; “<strong>Children’s Personal Information</strong>” means personal information as defined in <u><strong><a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-08-06/pdf/2012-19115.pdf" target="_blank">Section 312.2</a></strong></u> of the COPPA Rule. Further, we undertake a variety of ways to minimize collecting Children’s Personal Information from Children, and to avoid the need for our participating merchants from doing so in connection with a Child’s initiation of a proposed e-commerce transaction.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br>
Only a Parent may fully activate a Sub Account (defined below) and fully activate a Virtual Piggy profile for a Child.&nbsp; Otherwise, the Child’s activities on our Youth Site are restricted to browsing content and engaging in activities that do not require verified parental consent under COPPA.&nbsp; A Parent who elects to create an account for their Child that permits more than such browsing, provides any Personal Information required to set up a Sub Account for that Child, including a profile and account profile(s) of Children, including the Child’s Virtual Piggy User ID and Password.&nbsp; This way we are collecting such information from the Parent, not the Child, we can enable Parent controls and we can facilitate e-commerce transactions requested by the Child between the Parent and the merchant rather than between the Child and the merchant.&nbsp; Even after a Parent has set up a Child’s profile and account, a Child’s use of our service and participation and access to the Youth Site is not conditional upon his/her providing any Children’s Personal Information that requires verified parental consent under COPPA.&nbsp; Everything else necessary to facilitate merchant transactions comes from the Parent and the Parent can control what transactions can be facilitated by our Service.&nbsp; Youth, 13 years of age and older, may submit Personal Information themselves and may be able to activate a fully functional Oink account without parental consent.<strong></strong></p>
<p><br>
Our Youth Site is operated as a so-called mixed use site pursuant to <u><a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-08-06/pdf/2012-19115.pdf" target="_blank">Section 312.2</a></u><strong> </strong>of the COPPA Rule and we accordingly employ efforts to prevent the collection, use and disclosure of Children’s Personal Information from users who identify themselves as under 13 without first complying with applicable notice and parental consent requirements of COPPA.&nbsp; Without limitation, we do not make available to youth that we know to be under 13 years of age the ability to publicly post Children’s Personal Information on the Youth Site, including via third party social media plug-ins.&nbsp; We may, however, make such tools available to youth that represent they are 13 years of age or older.&nbsp; We also may provide youth, including Children, with tools to privately send an outbound-only message via the Service to their Parents, if their Parents have created a Primary Account (defined below) (e.g., transaction request message and wishlist submission).&nbsp; In any event, a Child’s use of Oink and participation and access to the Youth Site will not be conditional upon his/her providing any more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary for them to participate in an activity on the Site.&nbsp; We do not share Children’s Personal Information knowingly collected from a Child with any third party, other than our service providers and agents necessary to provide the Service, except to the extent permitted or compelled by applicable law (e.g., to law enforcement or in connection with public safety).&nbsp; We may, however, share Personal Information collected from Parents (and youth 13 years of age and older) with third parties as otherwise set forth in the other Sections of this Policy.</p>
<p>We collect the following Non-Personal Information from Children when they use the Wishlist functionality via our Service: the url for the merchant site and the particular products, services, games or other items they wish to purchase from the merchant using the Service including a description and price of the item.&nbsp; We may also allow Children to include a personalized message with a variety of requests to the Parent (such as, store permissions, funding options, shopping preferences, goals and Wishlist) where such requests and message are for the Parent’s benefit and not publicly available</p>
<p><br>
Inquiries and requests regarding the collection, use, processing, sharing and transfer of Children’s Personal Information in connection with our Services, including to notify us that your Child may have submitted Personal Information to us without your consent, may be directed to us as set forth in <a style="color:#F16312;" href="#T15">Section 15</a> below.</p>
<p><a name="T4"></a></p><p><a style="color:#F16312;" href="#top">Back to Top</a></p> <h3>4. Types of Information Collected</h3><p><a name="T4A"></a></p><h3>a. An Overview of the Information We Collect and How</h3>
<p>Individuals thirteen (13) years of age and above (“Individuals”) may create a functional Primary Oink Account (“<strong>Primary Account</strong>”). Only Parents may create profiles for other individuals (“Sub Accounts”). Other than Children’s Personal Information, which is addressed separately in <u><a href="#children">Section 3 </a></u>above, on the Service, as a Primary Account holder we may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you and your family members personally, such as your first and last name, email address, phone numbers and home addresses (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”); and (2) demographic information, such as information about you and your family member’s gender, age and potentially other information (“<strong>Demographic Information</strong>”).&nbsp; Further, we may ask Sub Account holders, over the age of thirteen (13), for Personal Information. We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service, including account registration forms, contact us forms, or when you otherwise interact with the Service.&nbsp; To the extent we combine Demographic Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Policy.</p>

If we offer and you choose to use this functionality to access our Service, the third-party site or application may send Personal Information about you to the Service. If so, we will then treat it as Personal Information under this Policy, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on our Service. In addition, we may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service. For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings. These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Policy. Virtual Piggy may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties. Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices. You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Service.</p><p><br>To the extent we permit such third party services to integrate with our Youth Site, we will require COPPA compliance in connection therewith for Children, as more fully set forth in <a style="color:#F16312;" href="#children">Section 3</a>. Older youth may be able to engage with such third party services via our Service without restriction.</p> <p><a name="T9"></a></p><p><a style="color:#F16312;" href="#top">Back to Top</a></p> <h3>9. Third Party Advertisers.</h3><p><br>The Service may use third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and may use third-party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of the Service and viewing and serving of ads and of our content; provided, however, that we do not have third party advertising on the Youth Site. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your visits to the Service. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.</p><p><br>The Service’s third-party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies (including Flash cookies), web beacons and other Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier. These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.</p><p><br>Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they use our technology to help store or collect data. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third-party advertisers and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with the information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party’s terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.</p><p><br>However, some may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available here. Further, while we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the Service, you may wish to visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer may be allowed under their own rules to deliver targeted content and/or ads to you, which may affect this and other sites, but does not mean you may no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Additional information is available on the NAI’s web site accessible by the above link.</p> <p><a name="T10"></a></p><p><a style="color:#F16312;" href="#top">Back to Top</a></p> <h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>10.
