<h1>Oink Privacy Policy</h1>
</div>
<div class="primary">
<div id="privacy" class="section">
<blockquote>Milk Inc. ("we," "us," "our," or "Company") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about how we use your personal information. By visiting, accessing or using the www.oink.com website and domain name, and any other linked pages, features, content, or application services (including, without limitation the Oink mobile app) offered from time to time by Company in connection therewith (collectively, the "Service"), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. </blockquote>
<h4 class="heading">What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers Company's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Company gathers when you access the Service and when you use Company's services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company does not own or control (including any third-party products or services used for logging into the Service or that are integrated with the Service), or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.</p>
<h4 class="heading">What Personal Information Does Company Collect?</h4>
<p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services, and allows our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to personalize their experience on the Service. We collect the following types of information from our customers:</p>
<h5>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</h5>
<p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Service or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected in this fashion may include your name, email address, IP address, browser information, username, password, rating history (including the name/location of businesses you have rated using the Service), photos you upload to the Service, tags and categories representing your areas of expertise on the Service, and any other information necessary for us to provide our services. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, improving the content of the Service, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about Company's products and services, including specials and new features. </p>
<h5>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</h5>
<ul>
<li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Service or use our services. For example, when you interact with our Service using our mobile app (e.g., by rating a business or item), we automatically receive and record information reported by your mobile device, including your physical location and mobile device ID. We do not share this location information with third parties (including other users), although we do use it for internal purposes such as fraud detection. Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, browser information, operating system, timestamps, the pages you request, and the actions and path you take on the Service.</li>
<li>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Service and how they use its various components. Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how customers use parts of the Service or services so that we can make the Service appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Service or services. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how people use the Service or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Company never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</li>
</ul>
<h5>E-mail Communications:</h5>
<p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Company if your computer or device supports this type of functionality. Company uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and to improve the Service and our services. When you receive e-mail from Company, you can opt out of receiving further e-mails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe.</p>
<h5>What About Cookies?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's (or other device's) persistent storage medium (e.g., hard drive) through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. We use cookies to enhance visitors' experiences, to learn more about their use of the Service and to improve quality. Company cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.</li>
<li>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Service's most attractive features.</li>
<li>Ads appearing on the Service may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer or other device each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer or device. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="heading">Will Company Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</h4>
<p>Personal Information about our customers is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as described below. </p>
<p><em>Advertisers:</em> As discussed above, we allow advertisers to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and you agree that we may use any of the information we have collected from you (including, without limitation, information you may have decided not to show to other users) to select or allow the advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. For example, we may allow an advertiser to target an ad to you based on your query history.</p>
<p><em>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</em> We anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses may sell items to you through the Service. In other situations, Company may provide services, or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p><em>With Your Consent:</em> Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information. If you choose to integrate your use of the Service with one or more third party social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, etc.), you understand that your User Submissions will be pushed to such third party sites and may be publicly accessible on such sites.</p>
