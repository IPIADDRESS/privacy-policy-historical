			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last updated May 24, 2018</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oberlo UAB (“Oberlo”), a subsidiary of Shopify Inc., provides online merchants the ability to find and easily import products into their online stores (the “Service”). This privacy policy describes how Oberlo UAB collects, processes, uses, and discloses information about you as you visit our website, as you use the Service, and if you install the Oberlo extension for Google Chrome (the “Extension”), as you use the Extension.</span></p>
<p><b>What Personal Information do we collect from you?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a merchant using or considering using Oberlo’s Service to stock or supply your online store, if you use our customer service tools or otherwise affirmatively contact us, if you sign up for information about the Service, or if you respond to an Oberlo survey, we may ask you for your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and credit card information (though we ourselves may not store all of this information). We also may obtain this information directly from Shopify Inc. Finally, if you contact our support service or if we otherwise need to verify your account, we may ask for additional documentation to help us verify your identity and make sure that we maintain the security of your account. All of the information described in this paragraph is referred to as “Account Information.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, if you are a merchant that uses the Service, or if you otherwise visit the Oberlo website, we automatically collect information about your device, including your IP address and potentially other unique device identifiers (for example, if you are using a phone with iOS or Android installed), Internet browser type and language, information about any website that referred you, the date/time of your visit, and any search keywords. We refer to this information collectively as “Device Information.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">“Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your device, and often contain an unique identifier that allows us to recognize your device over time (for example so we can maintain a shopping cart of items that you would like to order, or in order to provide you with content or services we believe will be more relevant to you).</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Web beacons” are electronic files that are used to track how you navigate a website: for example, whether you complete a transaction, or whether you submit a form or application.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Locally Stored Objects” are files stored through your web browser, when you install and use the Extension.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we refer to “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we’re including both Device Information and Account Information.</span></p>
<h1></h1>
<p><b>How do we use your Personal Information?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are buying a product from a store that is using the Service, we use the Personal Information that we collect from you in order to process the transaction (in particular, to coordinate shipping with and the merchant’s payment obligations to the supplier of the item). If you are a merchant using the Service, we use the Personal Information that we collect from you in order to provide the Service (i.e., to help you import items into your online store, to process transactions, etc.), and in some cases to process your payments to the supplier of items you sell through your store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, we may use your Personal Information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to respond to customer service inquiries or other communications from you;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to administer contests, promotions, or surveys;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to personalize your experience on our website and through the Service (for example, to highlight products you might be interested in adding to your store);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to ask for ratings and/or reviews of services or products;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to provide you with newsletters, marketing communications, or advertising; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to improve our website and the Service.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>How do we protect your Personal Information?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use many different measures to help protect information transmitted over or stored on our systems. For example, your Personal Information is contained behind secured networks, and is encrypted when transmitted to us via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, to try and keep the information secure. In addition, the payment information you provide us is processed by a third-party payment processor (Braintree Payments, a service provided by Paypal — for more information about their privacy practices, please see their privacy policy: </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><b>Sharing your Personal Information</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We share your Personal Information with third parties that help us process payments, operate our website, and otherwise provide the Service. Additionally, we may share your Personal Information with vendors we use to send our marketing materials and to conduct our advertising campaigns (including behavioral advertising as described above). We may also release your Personal Information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in responding to a lawful request or legal process, or otherwise to comply with laws or regulatory requirements;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to protect the rights and property of Oberlo, Shopify, our agents, customers, and others, including enforcing our agreements and policies or our network and physical assets; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to third party contractors or subprocessors who do work for us.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Third-party links</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occasionally, we may link to third-party content, applications, or websites on our website. This third-party content has their own privacy practices. This privacy policy does not describe how these third parties collect and use data. </span></p>
<h1></h1>
<p><b>Behavioral Advertising and Your Online Choices</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As described above, we may use your Personal Information to serve you with marketing or advertising, including through targeted advertisements. For more information about targeted or behavioral advertising, please visit </span><a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you would like to opt-out of the use of your Personal Information for purposes of targeted advertising, please use the opt-out portal of the Digital Advertising Alliance (</span><a href="http://optout.aboutads.info" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://optout.aboutads.info</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (</span><a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, because there is no consistent industry understanding of how to respond to “Do Not Track” signals, we do not alter our data collection and usage practices when we detect such a signal from your browser.</span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, if you are located in the EEA, we note that we generally process personal information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you, or that you might have with your buyers (for example if you are a merchant and provide us with your payment information to use to make payments in the course of using the Service, or if you are a buyer, to fulfill your order from a merchant). &nbsp;If we are unable to process information for this purpose, we would not be able to provide the Service (we require this information to process payment information and individual orders. Alternatively, we process this information to pursue our or our merchants’ legitimate business interests listed above (for example, to respond to customer service inquiries) unless we are required by law to obtain your consent for a particular processing operation.</span></p>

</li>
<li><strong>Products and Third Party Services</strong>
<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that the Services may enable or assist you in accessing, interacting with and/or purchasing Products from Suppliers, including via Third Party Services. Access to Products, Third Party Services and Suppliers is made available only as a convenience, and your purchase, access or use of any Third Party Services or Products is solely between you and the applicable Supplier. Any use by you of Third Party Services or Products made available through the Services is entirely at your own risk and discretion, and it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions and/or privacy policies applicable to such Products, Third Party Services or Suppliers before engaging them. Oberlo reserves the right to cease providing access via the Services to any Supplier, Products, or Third Party Service at any time, without entitling you to refund, credit or other compensation.</li>
<li>Oberlo offers users the ability to access Suppliers in the following ways:
<ol>
<li><strong>AliExpress.</strong>&nbsp;Ordering and payment for Products purchased from Suppliers on AliExpress is processed on the AliExpress platform. The Oberlo Chrome Extension is required to sync Products ordered via AliExpress with your Oberlo Account and Shopify Account and enable other functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Oberlo Marketplace.</strong>&nbsp;Ordering and payment for Products purchased from Suppliers on the Marketplace is processed by the Oberlo platform, and the order and fulfillment of these Products is automatically synced with your Shopify store, without use of the Oberlo Chrome Extension. Oberlo does not pre-screen Products made available via the Marketplace and we may refuse or remove any Products from the Marketplace at any time and in our sole discretion. We may, but have no obligation to, review and remove listings of Products that we determine in our sole discretion violate the Policies, these Terms of Service or the Shopify Terms of Service.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Oberlo may from time to time, but is not obligated to, provide access to Suppliers via additional Third Party Services. Your access to any Third Party Services made available by the Services from time to time is subject to these Terms of Service and the terms and conditions and/or privacy policies applicable to such Third Party Services.</li>
<li>In addition to these Terms of Service, you also agree to be bound by any additional service specific terms applicable to Products and Third Party Services you purchase from, or that are provided by, Suppliers in connection with your use of the Services.</li>
<li>You, and not Oberlo, are solely responsible for all of the terms and conditions of any transactions involving the purchase or sale of Products, including without limitation, terms regarding payment, returns, warranties, shipping, handling, transportation, storage, liability, insurance fees, applicable taxes, title and licenses, all of which must be in accordance with applicable law.</li>
<li>We do not provide any warranties with respect to Third Party Services or Products, including those made available via the Marketplace. You acknowledge that Oberlo has no control over Third Party Services or Products, and shall not be responsible or liable to anyone for such Third Party Services or Products, including any Supplier’s failure to deliver Products or any Product defects, or any inconsistencies between the Products ordered and those delivered. The availability of Third Party Services or Products via the Services or the integration or enabling of Third Party Services with the Services does not constitute or imply an endorsement, authorization, sponsorship, or affiliation by or with Oberlo. Oberlo strongly recommends that you thoroughly research Products and Third Party Services, including the Suppliers providing such Products and Third Party Services, before you purchase, use or resell them, to ensure they will meet your needs and comply with laws applicable in your jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of your Buyers.</li>
<li>If you install or enable a Third Party Service for use with the Services or purchase any Products via the Marketplace, you grant us permission to allow the applicable Supplier to access your data and to take any other actions as required for the interoperation of the Third Party Service with the Services or to fulfill any Products you order from such Supplier, and any exchange of data or other interaction between you and the Supplier is solely between you and such Supplier. Oberlo is not responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of your data or for any corresponding losses or damages you may suffer, as a result of access by a Third Party Service or a Supplier to your data. In addition, if you install the Oberlo Chrome Extension you grant Oberlo permission to access and use the data associated with your applicable AliExpress account, as necessary to sync the purchase and fulfillment of Products you order via such Third Party Service with your Oberlo Account and your Shopify account, and to otherwise provide the Services to you.</li>
<li>Under no circumstances shall Oberlo or its Affiliates, partners, officers, directors, agents or employees be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, extraordinary, exemplary or other damages whatsoever, that result from any Third Party Services, Products or your relationship with any Supplier or Buyer. These limitations shall apply even if Oberlo has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing limitations shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</li>
<li>You agree to indemnify and hold us and (as applicable) our Affiliates, Oberlo partners, officers, directors, agents and employees harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use, access to or interaction with, or the purchase or procurement of a Third Party Service or Product, or your relationship with a Supplier.</li>

<li><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability</strong>
<ol>
<li>You expressly agree that your use of, or inability to use, the Services is at your sole risk, and we disclaim responsibility for any harm resulting from your use of and access to the Services. The Services is provided to you (except as expressly stated by us) “as is” and “as available” for your use, without any representation, warranties or conditions of any kind, either express, implied or statutory, including all implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, fitness for a particular purpose, durability, title, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, that the results that may be obtained from the use of the Services will be accurate or reliable, or that the quality of any services, Products, Third Party Services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you through the Services will meet your expectations, or that any errors in the Services will be corrected. Moreover, Oberlo does not warrant that the results that may be obtained from the use of the Services, or information provided by Suppliers, will be accurate or reliable and you expressly agree that:
<ol>
<li>Oberlo has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of the Products or Third Party Services, the truth or accuracy of the listings available through the Services, including the Marketplace or any Third Party Service, or the ability of Suppliers to sell or fulfill orders for Products. Oberlo cannot ensure that a Supplier will actually complete a transaction. Consequently, Oberlo is not a party to, and will have no liability arising from, the transactions between you and Suppliers.</li>
<li>Oberlo is not responsible or liable for any content, for example, data, text, product descriptions, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, testimonials, audio, video, items or links posted by you or any other parties on the Services, or made available by any Suppliers.</li>
<li>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Oberlo and its Affiliates are not responsible for: (i) any actions, inactions, statements or guarantees made by Suppliers; (ii) Products; (iii) Third Party Services; or (iv) expected transactions of parties utilizing the Services, including those based on the transaction process, the performance of the contract, trading practices, course of dealing, product quality or product fulfillment and delivery. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In no event shall Oberlo or its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind, including, without limitation lost opportunity, lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data, intellectual property right infringement, replacement costs, loss of goodwill or any similar damages, whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, arising from your use of any part or parts of the Services or any Products or Third Party Services procured using the Services, or for any other claim related in any way to your use of the Services, even if advised of the possibility of same. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Indemnification</strong>
<ol>
<li>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Oberlo and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third-party, due to or arising out of a claim: (a) alleging that you, the Content or any Product listed on your Shopify store infringes or violates the intellectual property rights, privacy rights or other rights of a third party or violates applicable law; (b) arising out of your breach of these Terms of Service, the Policies and, to the extent you use the Marketplace, the Merchant Policy, or any other documents they incorporate by reference; or (c) arising out of your use of a Third Party Service or your relationship with a Supplier or Buyer.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Oberlo Marketplace.</strong>&nbsp;Any issues or disputes that arise between you and Marketplace Suppliers in connection with your purchase or attempted purchase of Products via the Marketplace must be reported directly to Marketplace Supplier through the Services and will be handled in accordance with the Merchant Policy. You must not attempt to resolve disputes outside of the Services, and you must follow the dispute resolution procedure set forth in the Merchant Policy. You should not respond to any Marketplace Supplier requests to resolve disputes outside of the Services and in such case, you should immediately direct the Marketplace Supplier to use the Oberlo dispute resolution procedure.</li>
<li><strong>Third Party Services.</strong>&nbsp;Any issues or disputes that arise in connection with your purchase or attempted purchase of Products via Third Party Services, including AliExpress, must be handled in accordance with such Third Party Service’s dispute resolution processes. Under no circumstances will Oberlo be responsible or liable for any disputes between you and Suppliers arising in connection with your use of Third Party Services, nor will Oberlo provide assistance or intervention in connection with such disputes.</li>
<li><strong>Disputes between Merchant and Oberlo.</strong>&nbsp;By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you may have against Oberlo on an individual basis in arbitration, as set forth in this Section 14(c) (referred to herein as the&nbsp;<strong>“Arbitration Agreement”</strong>). This will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against Oberlo, and also preclude you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, consolidated, or representative action brought against Oberlo by someone else.
<ol>
<li>You and Oberlo agree that any dispute, claim or controversy (<strong>“Dispute”</strong>), which cannot be resolved by the parties negotiating in good faith within 30 days of either party notifying the other of such Dispute, arising out of or relating to (a) these Terms of Service, including the Policies, or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or (b) your access to or use of the Services at any time, whether before or after the date you agreed to these Terms of Service, will be settled by binding arbitration between you and Oberlo, and not in a court of law. &nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, you and Oberlo each retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court for Disputes relating to unpaid fees in connection with this Agreement and the right to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</li>
<li>You acknowledge and agree that you and Oberlo are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Unless both you and Oberlo otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding.</li>
<li>The arbitration will be administered by JAMS, Inc. pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”). &nbsp;The Rules are available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a>.</li>
<li>These Terms of Service (including this Arbitration Agreement) shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of New York and United States federal &nbsp;laws applicable therein, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to these Terms of Service and is hereby expressly excluded.</li>
<li>Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within two years after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim. If applicable law provides a different limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.</li>
<li>Any arbitration hearing (<strong>“Hearing”</strong>) will be located at a site in New York (Manhattan) County selected by the Arbitrator, pursuant to the Rules. &nbsp;The Hearing may be conducted telephonically or videographically, upon request from either party. &nbsp;The Hearing will be conducted in English, and the Arbitrator may, at his or her discretion, also select a secondary language upon request by either party.</li>
<li>The arbitration will be conducted in front of a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), selected from the appropriate list of JAMS, Inc. arbitrators pursuant to the Rules. The parties agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service or the documents it incorporates by reference, including any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service (including this Arbitration Agreement) is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms of Service (including the Arbitration Agreement) are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.</li>
<li>If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the written submissions of the parties, unless the Arbitrator determines that a Hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a Hearing will be determined by the Rules.</li>
<li>The Arbitrator may issue an arbitration award in accordance with the Rules and any limitations of liability set out in Section 12 of these Terms of Service. &nbsp;Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so. The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. An Arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on all parties. An Arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon shall have no precedential effect. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Unless the Arbitrator concludes that your claim or the relief sought by you was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (determined with respect to (determined with respect to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b))), we will not seek, and hereby waive all rights we may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses if we prevail in arbitration. If the Arbitrator does conclude that your claim or the relief sought by you was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (determined with respect to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), the Arbitrator may in his or her sole discretion award us reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses.</li>
<li>Your responsibility to pay any filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the Rules. &nbsp;However, if your claim for damages does not exceed [$50,000], we will pay all such fees, unless the Arbitrator finds that the substance of your claim or the relief sought by you was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (determined with respect to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</li>
<li>Notwithstanding the provisions in these Terms of Service regarding consent to be bound by amendments to these Terms of Service, if Oberlo changes this Arbitration Agreement after the date you first agreed to the Arbitration Agreement (or to any subsequent changes to the Arbitration Agreement), you may reject any such change by providing Oberlo written notice of such rejection within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Effective” date. This written notice must be provided by email from the email address associated with your account to:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:legal@shopify.com">legal@shopify.com</a>. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this Arbitration Agreement. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Oberlo in accordance with the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first agreed to the Arbitration Agreement (or to any subsequent changes to the Arbitration Agreement).</li>
<li>If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms of Service; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of the Terms of Service (including this Arbitration Agreement) or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</li>
<li>If and only if this Arbitration Agreement is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Oberlo agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) must be brought exclusively in the state courts and federal courts located within New York (Manhattan) County, New York and you and Oberlo consent to venue and exclusive jurisdiction in those courts. Any claim not subject to arbitration must be commenced within two years after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim. If applicable law provides for a different limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Termination</strong>
<ol>
<li>These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these Terms of Service at any time by deleting the Oberlo application or by closing your Shopify store in accordance with the Shopify Terms of Service.</li>
<li>If in our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term or provision of these Terms of Service, including the Policies and, to the extent you use the Marketplace, the Merchant Policy, we also may terminate these Terms of Service at any time without notice and accordingly may deny you access to the Services, your Oberlo Account or any part thereof. The obligations (including payment obligations) and liabilities incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination of these Terms of Service for all purposes.</li>
<li>Upon termination of the Services by either party for any reason:
<ol>
<li>Oberlo will cease providing you with the Services and you will no longer be able to access your Oberlo Account;</li>
<li>unless otherwise provided in the Terms of Service or, to the extent you use the Marketplace, the Merchant Policy, you will not be entitled to any refunds of any Fees or Purchase Amounts, pro rata or otherwise; and,</li>
<li>any outstanding balance owed to Oberlo for your use of the Services through the effective date of such termination will immediately become due and payable in full.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Severability</strong>
<ol>
<li>In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, and such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Waiver and Entire Agreement</strong>
<ol>
<li>The failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</li>
<li>These Terms of Service and any documents incorporated into these Terms of Service or posted by us in respect to the Services constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us, and govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Survival</strong>
<ol>
<li>Sections 1, 2(b), 2(h), 4-6, 8-9 and 12-18 will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</li>
