    <!--paging_filter--><strong>New York Observer Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>
Last Updated: November 17 2006
</p><p>At <em>The New York Observer</em>, we understand that privacy is important, and we've created this policy to give you information about how we collect and use personal information. Our policy is divided into two sections: Section 1 describes how we collect and use data from users of the New York Observer Web site. Section 2 describes how we collect and use data from subscribers to the print and electronic editions of the New York Observer newspaper.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also encourage you to review our Terms of Service for information regarding rights, usage, trademarks, licenses, liability, trademark, and content ownership. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We reevaluate this policy on an ongoing basis, and we value your feedback. If you have questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, we ask that you contact us at:</p>
<p><strong>Customer Service</strong><br>The New York Observer, LLC<br>915 Broadway, 9th Floor <br>New York, New York 10010<br>(212) 755-2400<br>e-mail: <a href="mailto:customerservice@observer.com">customerservice@observer.com</a></p>
<p>Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time. We will post the new policy on this page, and, if the changes allow us to use personally identifying information in ways that are different from the ways specified at the time the information was originally collected, our Web site will contain a special notice about the changes. Each version of this privacy policy will be identified by its effective date, which you can find at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><strong>1. The New York Observer Online Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><em>The New York Observer</em> collects data, including personally identifying information, from people who use the New York Observer Web site. This section of our privacy policy explains how we collect and use this data. Please note that the New York Observer subscriber data is maintained separately from data gathered from our online users. This means that users of the New York Observer Web site who also subscribe to the New York Observer newspaper, in either print or electronic form, should read both this section and Section 2 (the New York Observer Subscriber Privacy Policy) in order to have a full understanding of our privacy practices.</p>
<p><strong>Information we collect and how we use it</strong></p>
<p>When you visit <em>The New York Observer</em> Web site, the New York Observer collects several forms of usage data, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log data. Our servers automatically record certain information sent by your browser, such as your Web request, your Internet Protocol address, your referring URL, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.</li>
<li>Cookie data. When you visit the New York Observer Web site, the New York Observer or one of our affiliates or third-party partners may send one or more "cookies"—small files containing a string of characters—to your computer to identify you as a unique user. If you have registered with the New York Observer, the information in your cookie is used to provide a more personalized experience on our site, for example by allowing you to customize portions of the site. If you haven't registered, the cookie identifies you as a unique user and helps ensure a smoother experience on the site, such as by limiting the number of times that you see certain subscription offers. If you have not registered on our site, we cannot link the user ID in the cookie with personal identifying information and data about you, such as your name or e-mail address.</li>
<li>Traffic and advertising data. Other cookies without personally identifying information and data are used to enable the New York Observer to gather and analyze site traffic and usage information, and to allow our advertising partners to manage the advertisements presented. These cookies sometimes work in conjunction with other techniques, such as clear GIFs or pixel tags; they do not contain personally identifying information, but they may gather information about what sites you have visited and use that information to determine which ads appear when you visit the New York Observer site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Browsers or third-party software can allow you to block the use of cookies while you surf our site. Or you can use third-party anonymizer services to mask information in your cookies or even general data such as your IP address. In such cases you would not be able to take advantage of most of the personalization services offered on the New York Observer Web site.</p>
<p>The aggregated information we collect is used for a number of purposes including the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>To improve the content and design of the New York Observer Web site.</li>
<li>To enable audit bureaus and third party advertisers to verify our claims of traffic to the site.</li>
<li>To help advertisers, potential advertisers or marketers assess the suitability of the site for their ad campaigns.</li>
<li>To help us understand more about the interests of our users, so that we can offer goods and services we believe may be of interest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many portions of the New York Observer site can be used without registering or giving us any personal information such as (but not limited to) your name and e-mail address. However, the New York Observer does collect personally identifying information regarding our online users, including in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you provide it to us, such as (but not limited to) by entering a contest, becoming a registered member, signing up for a newsletter or tutorial, or otherwise contacting us.</li>
<li>When you provide it to a company that powers a portion of our site or provides a special feature, such as a contest registration, that appears on our site.</li>
<li>When you provide information about yourself or your company to the New York Observer in connection with a subscription order, or when you provide information to any New York Observer affiliate, that information may be included in your the New York Observer user record, if one exists.</li>
<li>If you have previously registered with another New York Observer affiliate and you begin to fill out certain forms on the New York Observer Web site, the site may recognize you and automatically complete the form, and this auto-fill data will then be included in your the New York Observer user record.</li>
<li>If you have provided information to the New York Observer, from time to time we may enhance that information with other information that we collect from third-party sources.</li>
</ul>
