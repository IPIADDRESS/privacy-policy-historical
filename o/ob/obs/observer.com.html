		<h1><em>The New York Observer</em> Privacy Policy</h1>
			
			<p>Last Updated: March 16, 2009</p>
			
			<p>At <em>The New York Observer</em>, we understand that privacy is important, and we've created this policy to give you information about how we collect and use personal information.

Section 2 describes how we collect and use data from subscribers to the print and electronic editions of <em>The New York Observer</em> newspaper.   We also encourage you to review our Terms of Service for information regarding rights, usage, trademarks, licenses, liability, trademark, and content ownership.</p>
			
			<p>We reevaluate this policy on an ongoing basis, and we value your feedback. If you have questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, we ask that you contact us at:</p>

			<p>Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time.

			<h2><em>The New York Observer</em> Online Privacy Policy</h2>
			
			<p><em>The New York Observer</em> collects data, including personally identifying information, from people who use <em>The New York Observer</em> Web site. This section of our privacy policy explains how we collect and use this data. Please note that <em>The New York Observer</em> subscriber data is maintained separately from data gathered from our online users. This means that users of <em>The New York Observer</em> Web site who also subscribe to the New York Observer newspaper, in either print or electronic form, should read both this section and Section 2 (<em>The New York Observer</em> Subscriber Privacy Policy) in order to have a full understanding of our privacy practices.</p>
			
			<h2>Information we collect and how we use it</h2>
			
			<p>When you visit <em>The New York Observer</em> Web site, <em>The New York Observer</em> collects several forms of usage data, including:</p>
			<ul class="housekeeping-lists">
				<li>Log data. Our servers automatically record certain information sent by your browser, such as your Web request, your Internet Protocol address, your referring URL, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.</li>
				<li>Cookie data. When you visit <em>The New York Observer</em> Web site, <em>The New York Observer</em> or one of our affiliates or third-party partners may send one or more "cookies"–small files containing a string of characters–to your computer to identify you as a unique user. If you have registered with <em>The New York Observer</em>, the information in your cookie is used to provide a more personalized experience on our site, for example by allowing you to customize portions of the site.

If you have not registered on our site, we cannot link the user ID in the cookie with personal identifying information and data about you, such as your name or e-mail address.</li>
				<li>Traffic and advertising data. Other cookies without personally identifying information and data are used to enable <em>The New York Observer</em> to gather and analyze site traffic and usage information, and to allow our advertising partners to manage the advertisements presented. These cookies sometimes work in conjunction with other techniques, such as clear GIFs or pixel tags; they do not contain personally identifying information, but they may gather information about what sites you have visited and use that information to determine which ads appear when you visit <em>The New York Observer</em> site.</li>
				<li>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.

			<p>Browsers or third-party software can allow you to block the use of cookies while you surf our site.
