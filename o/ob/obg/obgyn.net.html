"Personal" data means data which identifies you as an individual and reflects your individual use of our products and services. It is data about you as a medical professional. Please note that a separate privacy policy covers our websites directed to consumers. If you are uncertain about which privacy policy applies to a particular website or web page, consult the privacy link at the bottom of the web page.<br>

<p><strong>Information  We Collect About You </strong><strong><br>

<ul type="disc">
  <li> Information you give us about yourself, including data about your professional credentials and practice, when you register for or subscribe to any of our events, services or resources, register with us through a UBM Medica Network site or contact us directly. We may use medical or other databases to update or complete certain information about you. </li>

For more information about the AMA's own privacy practices, please click  <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/footer/privacy-policy.shtml">http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/footer/privacy-policy.shtml</a>. </li>
  <li> Once you register we create an account for you, adding data about how you use and interact with our events, products, services, resources and email campaigns. </li>
</ul>
<p>We also use common Internet data collection technologies to collect data: We use "cookies" and associated web beacons. A cookie is simply a piece of code which is placed on your personal computer to recognize the computer as it accesses our websites. Many cookies are not "personal" cookies in that they are not associated with you as an identified individual.  </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>	We recognize or verify who is accessing our websites or content areas that require registration and so, may place "personal" cookies on your pc.  We may also use this cookie to understand your interests and put you in touch with third parties that we expect will have additional information relevant to your interests. </li>
  <li>	Some but not all of our websites include online advertising. Cookies are also used to serve such advertising or content. We may display ads on our own sites on a personally identifiable basis. We allow other companies, called third party ad servers, to serve ads that appear on our sites as well.  Please see the information under  <a href="http://imaging.ubmmedica.com/all/UBMMedica_Privacy_Statement.html#choices">"Your Choices"</a> for       details about online advertising. </li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we collect log data, including IP, or Internet Protocol, addresses used to access our websites, and other routine information about your browser and pc capabilities. We use this data to administer our systems. We or third party ad servers may use the information to limit the number of times you see a particular ad, to target information or ads on a geographic basis or to display ads in the format best matched to your pc's capabilities. We do not associate this log and technical capabilities data with your account in the routine course of our business.</p>
<p><strong>How  We Use Information About You </strong><strong><br>
