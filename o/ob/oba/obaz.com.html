<h5>oBaz Privacy Policy</h5>
<p>oBaz's Privacy Policy describes the ways we collect, store, use and protect user information. We may amend this policy at any time by posting a revised version on our website. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it. By using or accessing oBaz, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. oBaz, LLC. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact oBaz Support at help@oBaz.com. Information Collected oBaz collects two types of information: personal information that users knowingly disclose to oBaz, and website-use information automatically generated by users as they interact with the site. Personal Information When users sign up for oBaz, they are asked to provide profile information, such as name, avatar, address, phone number, zip code, email address, preferences, and other similar information. oBaz also collects certain financial information, including bank account numbers and routing numbers and credit and debit card numbers, to allow users to fund their oBaz accounts, payments, and purchases through outside sources. oBaz may also require users to provide additional information to help verify identity or address or manage risk, such as date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, or other information. oBaz may also obtain information about users from third parties such as the Social Security Administration or identity verification services. Website-Use Information oBaz collects certain information from users' browsers using small data files called “cookies.” oBaz uses session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. This type of cookie helps oBaz recognize a user if he or she visits multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we do not need to require a password to access each page. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to oBaz. We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. Users can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable the feature. We do link the information we store in cookies to user accounts. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site for purposes such as analytics, of which data is only collected in the aggregate. We have no access to or control over these cookies. Log Files As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to combat fraud and unauthorized access. We use a third-party tracking service called Google Analytics that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate, like time and length of visit, in order to improve the service. Use of Information Obtained by OBaz oBaz’s primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide users with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. oBaz uses this information to provide services and support; process transactions and send notifications regarding general operation of the service, such as new messages or reminders, or new services offered by oBaz; resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems; prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement; customize, measure, and improve our services and the content and layout of our website; compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties. We also use your information to send promotional or marketing newsletters. If you choose to unsubscribe from these emails, please click on the unsubscribe link in the email In order to provide a meaningful service to our users, some personal profile information, including name, email address, phone number and photo, is shared with other users that belong to the same group(s). You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit in your profile, or on any other public forum such as a blog on this site can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. oBaz will never share a user’s financial information with other users. We utilize an import contacts feature to help you add your contacts. We make it easy for you to invite people from your email address books to join you on our Site. At your request we will search your email address book to help you import your contacts to our site. We use a technology called OAuth to securely access your GMail contact book. You can then easily send emails to friends, from oBaz, inviting them to join. You can add, import and collect addresses and store them in your address book. Links to Other Sites If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave our site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as us. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to our site, you should read that site’s privacy statement before providing any personally identifiable information. Storage of Personal Information oBaz stores and processes user information using third party servers located in secure data centers in the US. This information is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations. oBaz uses computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, and authorizes access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. oBaz never stores payment or related personal data. Instead of storing payment information on company systems, oBaz stores this information in PCI-compliant and PA-DSS certified data centers residing within the banking and processing network. oBaz encrypts and securely transmits user payment information to the banking network at the time of initial payment acceptance. oBaz receives the response along with a “payment token” that it uses to reference that transaction for any future billing action. oBaz stores only this secure token. Sharing of Personal Information with Third Parties oBaz may share personal information with third-party service providers under contract who help with certain parts of our business operations including payment, fraud prevention, secure data storage, merchant recommendations, group offerings, and other similar services. oBaz ensures that these parties are properly licensed and regulated, and only use personal information in connection with the services they perform for oBaz. oBaz shares personal information with certain financial institutions or their agents that we partner with to jointly create and offer certain products. oBaz may share personal information in the event of a merger or acquisition. Should such an event occur, oBaz will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to personal information. If personal information could be used contrary to this policy, users will receive prior notice. Please see “Changes to this privacy policy” to learn how you will be notified. oBaz may be compelled to share personal information to law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties in the event of a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure, or when oBaz believes in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our User Agreement. oBaz will not sell, rent, share or trade any of your personal information to third parties for promotional purposes or in the normal course of doing business and only shares your personal information with third parties as described in this policy. Editing Personal Information Users can review and edit personal information at any time such as their address, phone numbers, and preferences (such as privacy and email settings) by logging in to their account, then clicking on “My Settings”. Information will be updated immediately; however, some shared information (e.g. a payment to a group or a request for payment from a group) generally cannot be removed by a user. Contacting oBaz regarding this Privacy Policy If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy, you should contact us by using the email address help@oBaz.com You can also write to us at: oBaz, LLC. 600 W. Chicago Ave. Suite 630 Chicago, IL 60610 Changes to this Privacy Statement If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>
