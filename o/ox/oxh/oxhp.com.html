<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>We recognize that the privacy of your personal information  is important.Â&nbsp; The purpose of this  Privacy Policy is to let you know how we handle the information collected  through the use of this website. Portions of this website may describe privacy  practices applicable to specific types of information or to information  provided on specific Web pages.</p>
<p>The oxfordhealth.com Privacy Policy does not apply to  information collected through other means such as by telephone or in person,  although that information may be protected by other privacy policies. As used  in this Privacy Policy, terms such as “we” or “our” and “Company” refer to UnitedHealthcare  Insurance Company, UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company of New York,  UnitedHealthcare of New England, Inc., UnitedHealthcare of New Jersey, Inc.,  UnitedHealthcare of New York, Inc., Oxford Health Plans (NY), Inc., Oxford  Health Plans (NJ), Inc., Oxford Health Plans (CT), Inc., Oxford Health  Insurance, Inc., United HealthCare Services, Inc., UnitedHealthcare Service  LLC, Oxford Health Plans LLC, or current and future affiliate entities,  including our parent company UnitedHealth Group.</p>

  <a name="1"></a><strong>Cookies and Tracking</strong></p>
<p>The Company uses various technologies, which may include  “cookie” technology, to gather information from our website visitors such as  pages visited and how often they are visited, and to enable certain features on  this website. </p>
<p>“Cookies” are small text files that may be placed on your  computer when you visit a website or click a URL.Â&nbsp; Cookies may include “single-session cookies”  which generally record information during only a single visit to a website and  then are erased, and “persistent” cookies which are generally stored on a  computer unless or until they are deleted or are set to expire.Â&nbsp; You may disable cookies and similar items by  adjusting your browser preferences at any time; however, this may limit your  ability to take advantage of all the features on this website.Â&nbsp; You may also manage the use of “flash”  technologies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website.  Note that we do not currently respond to web browser “Do Not Track” signals  that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information about online  activities over time and across third-party websites or online services  because, among other reasons, there is no common definition of such signals and  no industry-accepted standards for how such signals should be interpreted. </p>
<p>We may also allow third party service providers to use  cookies and other technologies to collect information and to track browsing  activity over time and across third party websites such as web browsers used to  read our websites, which websites are referring traffic or linking to our websites,  and to deliver targeted advertisements to you. We do not control these third  party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third  parties using such technologies. For more information about third party  advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see  http://www.aboutads.info/consumers, and to opt-out of such ad networks’ and  services’ advertising practices, go to www.aboutads.info/choices. Once you  click the link, you may choose to opt-out of such advertising from all  participating advertising companies or only advertising provided by specific  advertising companies.</p>
