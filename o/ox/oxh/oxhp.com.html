        Notice unless and until it is amended. This Notice takes effect April

      <p><strong>Q. </strong><em><strong>How does Oxford use or disclose your 

        PHI?</strong></em><br>

        <strong>A.</strong> Oxford may use or disclose your PHI, without your 

        consent or authorization, under the following circumstances: </p>

      <ul>

        <li><u>Treatment</u>: We may disclose your PHI to a healthcare provider 

          who requests it in order to provide you with necessary medical treatment, 

          such as emergency care, X-rays or lab work. A provider might be a doctor, 

          a hospital, a home healthcare agency, etc </li>

        <br>

        <br>

        <li> <u>Payment</u>: We may use or disclose your PHI to pay claims submitted 

          by a healthcare provider for treatment provided to you. For example, 

          we may ask a hospital emergency department for details about the treatment 

          you received so that we can accurately pay the hospital for your care. 

        </li>

        <br>

        <br>

        <li> <u>Healthcare Operations</u>: We may use or disclose your PHI to manage 

          our business. Examples include using it to determine appropriate premiums, 

          to conduct quality improvement activities, to contact you regarding 

          benefits or services that might be of interest to you, and to provide 

          you with preventative health advisories. </li>

        <br>

        <br>

        <li> <u>Plan Sponsor</u>: We may disclose limited PHI to your health plan sponsor, 

          benefits administrator, or group health plan in order to perform plan 

          administrative functions such as activities related to billing and renewals. 

        </li>

        <br>

        <br>

        <li> <u>Underwriting</u>: We may receive your PHI for underwriting, premium rating 

          or other activities relating to the creation, renewal or replacement 

          of a contract of health insurance or health benefits. Once an Oxford 

          Member, use and disclosure of your PHI is governed by this Notice. </li>

        <br>

        <br>

        <li> <u>Marketing</u>: We may use your PHI to contact you with information about 

          health-related benefits and services, treatment alternatives, or appointment

        <br>

        <li> <u>Required by Law</u>: We may use or disclose your PHI when we are required 

          to do so by law. For example, upon request, we would disclose PHI to 

          the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services so that this agency 

          can verify Oxford compliance with federal privacy laws. </li>

        <li> <u>Health Oversight Activities</u>: We may disclose your PHI to health oversight 

          organizations and agencies as part of accreditation surveys, investigations 

          related to our eligibility for government programs, regulatory audits, 

          and for licensure and disciplinary actions. </li>

        <br>

        <li> <u>Workers' Compensation</u>: We may disclose your PHI to comply with laws 

          relating to workers' compensation or other similar programs that provide

        <br>

        <li> <u>Public Health and Safety</u>: We may disclose your PHI to the extent 

          necessary to avert an imminent threat to your safety or the health or 

          safety of others. We may disclose your PHI to appropriate authorities

        <br>

        <br>

        <li> <u>To Family and Friends</u>: If, in the event of a medical emergency, you 

          are unable to provide any required authorization, we may disclose PHI 

          to a family member, friend or other person to the extent necessary to 

          ensure appropriate medical treatment or to facilitate payment for that 

          treatment. </li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Q.</strong> <em><strong>Does Oxford ever need an authorization 

        to use or disclose your PHI?</strong></em><br>

        <strong>A. </strong>Yes. Except for the purposes described above, Oxford 

        cannot use or disclose your PHI without a signed authorization from you. 

        If you provide such an authorization to Oxford, you may revoke it at any 

        time. Your revocation will not affect any use or disclosure of PHI made 

        while the authorization was in place.<br>

        <br>

      </p>

      <p> <strong>Q.</strong><em><strong> Can you inspect or receive copies of 

        any PHI in Oxford's possession? </strong></em><br>

        <strong>A.</strong> Yes. You have the right to inspect or receive copies 

        of your PHI with certain exceptions. You must make a request to Oxford 

        in writing. Oxford reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee for the 

        cost of producing and mailing the PHI. Request forms are available on 

        the Oxford web site or by calling the number listed at the end of this 

        Notice. <br>

        <br>

        <strong>Q.</strong><em><strong> Can you find out if Oxford disclosed your 

        PHI to a third party?<br>

        </strong></em><strong>A.</strong> Yes. You have the right to receive an 

        accounting of all occasions when Oxford disclosed your PHI for any purpose 

        other than treatment, payment, healthcare operations and certain other 

        instances. Beginning with disclosures made on or after April 14, 2003, 

        we will maintain a record of disclosures for six (6) years. A request 

        for an accounting must be submitted to Oxford in writing. We reserve the 

        right to charge you a reasonable fee for the cost of producing and mailing 

        the information if you request this accounting more than once in a 12-month 

        period. Please note, that Connecticut and New Jersey members will automatically 

        get an abridged accounting whenever they make a request to inspect or 

        receive copies of their PHI. <br>

        <br>

        <strong>Q.</strong><em><strong> Can you restrict the use or disclosure 

        of your PHI by Oxford? <br>

        </strong></em><strong>A.</strong> Yes. You have the right to request that 

        Oxford place additional restrictions on the use or disclosure of your 

        PHI. We are not required by law to agree to these restrictions. However, 

        if we do agree to the restrictions, we will abide by them except in the 

        event of an emergency.<br>

        <br>

        <strong>Q.</strong><em><strong> Can you request that Oxford use alternate 

        means to confidentially communicate with you about your PHI or communicate 

        with you at an alternate location?<br>

        </strong></em><strong>A.</strong> Yes. You must inform Oxford, in writing, 

        that confidential communication by alternate means or to an alternate 

        location is required to avoid potential harm to yourself or others. We 

        must accommodate your request if it is reasonable, specifies the alternate 

        communication means or location, and does not interfere with the collection 

        of premiums, the payment of claims, or the administration of your health 

        insurance coverage.<br>

        <br>

        <strong>Q.</strong><em><strong> Do you have the right to request that 

        Oxford correct, amend, or delete your PHI?</strong></em><br>

        <strong>A.</strong> Yes. You must make your request in writing, and it 

        must explain why the PHI should be corrected, amended, or deleted. Oxford 

        may deny your request if we did not create the PHI in question or for 

        certain other reasons. If we deny your request, we will provide you with 

        a written explanation. You may respond with a statement of disagreement 

        to be added to the information you sought to change. If we accept your 

        request to correct, amend, or delete the PHI, we will make reasonable 

        efforts to inform others of the changes and to include the changes in 

        any future disclosures of that information.<br>
