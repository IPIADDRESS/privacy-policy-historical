          To improve the effectiveness &amp; usability of our sites for our users, we use "cookies", or such similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the user's individual interests using the Identified Computer. Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g. through registration), Bugzy has no way of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User's computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the User's hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to the User's browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process that Bugzy does not control.<br> <br> Bugzy's web servers automatically collect limited information about User's computer's connection to the Internet, including User's IP address, when the User visits our site. (User's IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data to the User -- such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not identify the User personally. Bugzy uses this information to deliver its web pages to Users upon request, to tailor its site to the interests of its users, to measure traffic within its site and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where Bugzy's visitors come.<br>
          <br>Oxicash also includes links to other websites. Such websites are governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond Bugzy's control. Once the User leaves Bugzy's servers (the User can tell where he/she is by checking the URL in the location bar on the User's browser), use of any information provided by the User is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site which the User is visiting. That policy may differ from Bugzy's own. If the User can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, the User may contact the site directly for more information.<br>
          <br>
          When Oxicash presents information to it's online advertisers -- to help them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our website -- it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our site.

The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to such servers being password-protected and strictly limited based on need-to-know basis. However, we understand that as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. Thus, we cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. Further, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas will be available to anyone with Internet access.<br> <br>
          Bugzy also believes that the internet is an ever-evolving medium. We may periodically review from time to time and change our privacy policy to incorporate such future changes as may be considered appropriate. Our use of any information we gather will always be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be.<br>
