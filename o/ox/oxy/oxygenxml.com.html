                    providers who provide assistance with billing, processing credit card payments,
                    hosting, storage, technical support, and customer service. If a service provider

                    partners. Please be aware that Syncro does not control our business partners’
                    use of such information. Our partners are responsible for managing their own use
                    of the personal information collected in these circumstances. We recommend you

                    software products if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such

                    exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; (v) prevent harm to the
                    rights, property, or safety of us, our users, yourself, or any third party; or
                    (vi) for the purpose of collaborating with law enforcement agencies or in case
                    we find it necessary in order to enforce intellectual property or other legal
                    rights.
            </li><li><b>Business transfers</b>: We may share or transfer
                    your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale
                    of company assets, financing, acquisition, dissolution, corporate

            (“EEA”), have certain statutory rights in relation to their Personal Data. Below are the
            rights that you have under law, and what Syncro does to protect those rights:</p><ul><li><b>The right to be informed.</b> Syncro is publishing
                    this Privacy Policy to keep you informed as to what we do with your personal
                    information. We strive to be transparent about how we use your data.
            </li><li><b>The right to access.</b> You may have the right to
                    access the personal information that we hold about you. When you exercise your
                    right to request access to the information Syncro processes about you, you will
                    not have to pay a fee to access your personal data. However, we may charge a
                    reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.
                    Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. 
            </li><li><b>The right to rectification.</b> If the information
                    Syncro holds about you is inaccurate or not complete, you may have the right to
                    ask us to rectify it. If that data has been passed to a third party with your
                    consent or for legal reasons, then we will ask them to rectify the data.
            </li><li><b>The right to erasure.</b> This is sometimes called
                        ‘<span class="emf">the right to be forgotten</span>’. In certain circumstances,
                    you may have the right to the erasure of personal information that we hold about
                    you (for example if it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was
                    originally collected). Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain
                    information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions, or to comply
                    with our legal obligations.
            </li><li><b>The right to restrict processing.</b> You may
                    have the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal
                    information in certain circumstances (for example, where you believe that the
                    personal information we hold about you is not accurate or lawfully held). This
                    means we are permitted to store the data but not further process it. We keep
                    just enough data to make sure we respect your request in the future.
            </li><li><b>The right to portability.</b> You may have the
                    right to be provided with your personal data in a structured, machine readable
                    and commonly used format, and to request that we transfer the personal
                    information provided by you to another service or provider.
            </li><li><b>The right to object.</b> You may have the right to
                    object to our processing of your personal data for purposes based on our
                    legitimate interests. In some cases, we may be able to demonstrate that we have
                    compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which overrides your
                    rights and freedoms.
            </li><li><b>The right to withdraw consent.</b> We may seek to
                    rely on your consent in order to process certain personal information. Where we
                    do so, you have the right not to provide your consent or to withdraw your
                    consent at any time. You can opt-out of receiving marketing communications from
                    Syncro by clicking "unsubscribe" in any marketing email communications we send
                    you, or by sending an email to <span class="link" data-email="privacy,oxygenxml.com,privacy@oxygenxml.com"><a href="mailto:privacy@oxygenxml.com" class="link">privacy@oxygenxml.com</a></span>. Please note that if we can also rely on other
                    bases to process your personal data aside from consent, then we may do so even
                    if you have withdrawn your consent.
            </li><li><b>The right to comply to Supervisory Authority.</b>
                    You have the right to complain to the Supervisory Authority if you feel that
                    Syncro has not responded to your requests to solve a problem. 
            </li><li><b>The right in relation to automated decision making and
                        profiling.</b> If we use either automated decision making or
                    profiling, then you have a right to know. Also, we need your consent if either
                    of these are used to make a decision that affects you. As with all consent, you
                    can withdraw it at any time.

            need to do so and/or for as long as is needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
            Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such
            as tax, legal, accounting, or other purposes). After such time, we will either delete or
            anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the
            information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
            information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible. How long we
            keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described

                If you are a customer, partner, or prospect, we keep the information for
                    the duration of our relationship. Due to the possibility of long sales
                    cycles, one never knows when a potential client will re-engage with Syncro
                    and having the background and history of the contracting party will assist
                    Syncro in providing a better service. Therefore, please note that unless you
                    instruct us otherwise, we retain the information we collect for as long as
                    needed to provide our Products and Services and to comply with our legal

                When you contact us for technical support, we may keep a record of your

                    information may be retained for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes
                    we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal,
                    accounting, or reporting requirement.

                If you have requested to receive marketing communications, we will keep
