<h1>Privacy Policy</h1><p>
Updated on: 24 January 2013
</p><p>
Effective from: 1 February 2013
</p><p>
This privacy policy is specific to this website ("Website") and overrides any other privacy policies appearing elsewhere on Oxford University Press websites.
</p><p>
Oxford University Press ("OUP", "we", "us" or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy online. This privacy policy explains how we will do this. We will review this privacy policy in the light of comments we receive so please check the latest version. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us by emailing us at <a href="javascript:encrypt('Jnls.Cust.Serv', 'oup.com', '' );">Jnls.Cust.Serv@oup.com</a>.
</p><p>
By using the Website, you are accepting the practices described in this statement.
</p><p>
<strong>What kind of information do we collect and how do we use it?
<br></strong> When you visit the Website, OUP may collect information and statistics that contain your identifying information. The information collected may include information relating to your behaviour and navigation on the Website. This information allows us to carry out internal research on our usersâ€™ interests, demographics and behaviour so that we can better understand, and in turn, provide better information, products and services to you and other customers.
</p><p>
If you subscribe to or ask for further information about the Website, we ask for your name, email address, postal address, and other relevant personal information. Personal information submitted in this way is added to our access control database, hosted by a third party hosting company, and to our customer databases at OUP's and/or our affiliates' premises. This information will be updated if you inform us of any changes.
</p><p>
If you are a subscriber (which may be you as an individual or an institution to which you are affiliated) (including a subscriber on a trial basis), your personal information will be used to enable us to verify that you are a subscriber and to deliver any restricted content on the Website to you.
</p><p>
If you sign up to receive newsletters, we will ask you for your email address and your name and this information will be added to our customer databases.
</p><p>
We may use information in our customer databases to send you information about us, our affiliates, our products and services, and our affiliates' products and services that we think may be of interest to you electronically or otherwise.
</p><p>
We request personal information (such as your name, email address and other contact details) from you when you contact us with subscription management queries, technical problems, to comment on the Website, or when you ask for information about how to use the products and/or services made available on the Website. Personal information submitted by you via the "contact us" page will not be added to our customer databases and we request it simply so that we can respond to you about your query. Statistics regarding the types of queries submitted to us via the "contact us" page may be collated by us in aggregate form so that we can effectively monitor the Website and improve levels of service.
</p><p>
If you have asked for information or subscribed to restricted content on the Website in the past and no longer subscribe to such service and do not wish us to store information about you, please contact us and we will remove your details from our customer databases. We need to store information about current subscribers in order to fulfil our contractual requirements to you and grant you access to restricted content on the Website.
</p><p>
You may notify us either in writing or by telephone, fax or email that you object to being contacted or being contacted in a particular stated way. If you use more than one email address to communicate with us, please notify us of each email account you use.
</p><p>
<strong>When do we share information? 
<br></strong>We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
</p><p>
We share your information within OUP. We also share your information with our affiliates, licensors and suppliers, which assist us in making the Website available to you (e.g. our hosting supplier).
</p><p>
If we believe that your use of the Website is unlawful or damaging to others, we reserve the right to disclose the information we have obtained through the Website about you to third parties to the extent that it is reasonably necessary in our opinion to prevent, remedy or take action in relation to such conduct.
</p><p>
We may also disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation; in order to enforce or apply any agreements or licences with you; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of OUP, our employees, affiliates, licensors, suppliers, and/or our customers. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
</p><p>
If any part of our business (including those of our affiliates) is sold or integrated with another business, your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers.
</p><p>
<strong>Use of cookies 
<br></strong>OUP uses "cookies" and other technologies on the Website. The terms and conditions governing OUP's use of "cookies" and such other technologies on the Website are set out in OUP's <a href="http://global.oup.com/cookiepolicy/?cc=gb">Cookie Policy</a>.
</p><p>
By using the Website, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of our Cookie Policy.
</p><p>
<strong>Security 
<br></strong>Some of your personal information is stored at a data centre managed by our third party hosting company. The data centre managed by our third party hosting company is specifically designed to be physically secure and to admit authorised personnel only, who are contractually bound to keep all of our data confidential.
</p><p>
Access to our customer databases is only given on a 'need to know basis'.
</p><p>
The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us, our affiliates or for one of our suppliers. However, we have taken the steps outlined above to try to improve the security of your information. By using the Website, you consent to these transfers.
</p><p>
<strong>Updating Your Details 
<br></strong>If any of the information that you have provided to OUP changes e.g. if you change your e-mail address, please let us know the correct details by sending an e-mail to <a href="javascript:encrypt('Jnls.Cust.Serv', 'oup.com', '' );">Jnls.Cust.Serv@oup.com</a>.
</p><p>
<strong>Changes to our Privacy Policy 
<br></strong>We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy. Any changes we may make to this privacy policy will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail.
