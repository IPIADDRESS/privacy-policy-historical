<h2>Retention of information</h2>
<p>All profile information and user data is retained only for as long as is required in order for it to be used for its intended purpose. </p>

<p>OMG takes all reasonable measures to ensure that profile information and user data are stored as securely as possible and not lost, misused or altered. </p>
<p>OMG’s infrastructure is hosted in an enterprise-level, highly secure data centre with UPS, fire detection and suppression systems with a sophisticated environment management system.
