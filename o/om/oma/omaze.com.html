<p><b>What Information Do We Collect Through The Website?</b></p>
<p>Omaze collects both personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information. When we refer simply to the term information in this privacy policy we are referring to how Omaze collects, uses, or shares both the personally identifiable, and non-personally identifiable information that it collects.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information refers to information that is collected in conjunction with your name. Omaze does not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it voluntarily. If you do not want us to collect personally identifiable information about you, you can simply decide not to submit it to us. The personally identifiable information that we collect includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>name;</li>
<li>date of birth;</li>
<li>contact information, such as name, postal address, email address and telephone number;</li>
<li>other personal information you provide to us on our website and other data collected automatically through the website; and</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-personally identifiable information refers to information that Omaze may collect from you that is not collected in conjunction with your name.</p>
<p>Omaze does not seek any personally identifiable information from children, and our Website is not designed to solicit information from children under 13. To participate in any sweepstakes through this Website, you must be at least 13 years of age.</p>

<section class="privacy_section">
<p><b>How Do We Use This Information?</b></p>
<p>Our primary purpose in collecting information about you is to provide you with services or information that you request or to process your payments. We may also decide to use information about you to track how you use our site or to help us enhance your online experience, for example, we may access your account information to provide technical support and quality assurance. In addition, we may aggregate the personally identifiable information that you provide with the personally identifiable information that other users provide in order to conduct research, analysis, or studies for our own purposes (i.e., not related to providing you with specific services), including improving our services and future sweepstakes.</p>
<p>We may also use the information that you provide to us to communicate with you about our current activities, future events and sweepstakes or to notify you about any changes to our services. If you decide that you would no longer like to receive such messages you can opt-out from receiving such emails from Omaze. In order to opt-out you can click on an unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of every commercial e-mail that you receive from Omaze. If you opt-out, you will continue to receive communications from us relating to any payments you make or other services you request or purchase.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies.</span> Cookies are bits of electronic information that a website can transfer to a visitor’s hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit. Cookies allow website operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor’s individual preferences. Many commercial websites use cookies. We may use cookies on our Website to allow us to, among other things, measure activity, to personalize your experience, and to track your status or progress when requesting information. If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual or all of the cookies on your computer by following your browser’s help file directions. However, if your browser is set to reject cookies or you manually delete cookies, you may have some trouble accessing and using some of the pages and features that are currently on our Website, or that we may put on our Website in the future.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Google analytics.</span> The Sites use Google Analytics (and in the future may use other similar sites or services), a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"), to better assist us in understanding how the Sites are used. Google Analytics will place cookies on your computer that will generate information that we select about your use of the Sites, including your computer's IP address. That information will be transmitted to and stored by Google. The information will be used for the purpose of evaluating consumer use of the Sites, compiling reports on Site activity for our use, and providing other services relating to Site activity and usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. Please note that by doing so, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Sites. The use of cookies by Google Analytics is covered by Google's privacy policy. From time to time, we may enter into agreements with other third party providers for web analytic and other similar services. If we enter into such an agreement, we may share your information, including personal information, with the provider or such provider may have access to and collect your information on our behalf. Your information, including personal information, may be stored with the provider.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Information.</span> Like the operators of most websites, we may use tracking software and similar technology, which automatically collects information about your computer hardware and software, and use of the Website. This information may be used by us for the operation of the Website and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Website.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit Card Information.</span> When you use a credit card to make a donation, you are actually being redirected to our third party provider. WE DO NOT COLLECT, ACCESS, STORE OR PROCESS ANY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opt out.</span> You have a right to opt-out of personalized targeted ads. Our advertising partners are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), to opt out of targeted ads served by our advertising partners, or any or all Network Advertising Initiative members, click here. Please note that when you opt-out using this method the Network Advertising Initiative will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. If you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, you may need to renew your opt-out choice. Once you have opted out, our advertising partners will no longer use information they have collected to help deliver targeted advertisements.</p>
<p>Your browser and other mechanisms may permit you to send do-not-track signals or other similar signals to express your preferences regarding online tracking. To the extent you employ such browser do-not-track signals or other similar mechanisms, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor such requests received by us to the extent we have the capacity and resources to identify and process your request. Due to the potential for rapid and diverse developments of technology in this area, we cannot guarantee that we can process every type of request that exists or may be developed in the future. As noted above, third parties, such as our advertising partners, may collect data that relates to you. We cannot control third parties' responses to do-not-track signals or other such mechanisms. Third parties' use of data relating to you and responsiveness to do-not-track signals is governed by their respective privacy policies.</p>
</section>
<section class="privacy_section">
<p><b>How Do We Protect Your Information?</b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information security.</span> To safeguard against unauthorized access to personal information by third parties, all electronic personal information held by Omaze is maintained on systems that are protected by up-to-date secure network architectures that contain firewalls and intrusion detection devices. The data saved in servers is “backed up” (i.e. the data are recorded on separate media) to avoid the consequences of any inadvertent erasure, destruction or loss otherwise. The servers are stored in facilities with high security, access restricted to unauthorized personnel, fire detection and response systems.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Physical and administrative security.</span> We employ reasonable physical and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information.</p>
<p>While we will use such efforts, we cannot and will not insure the security of your information. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third party access or other acts of third parties, or acts or omissions beyond our reasonable control.</p>
</section>
<section class="privacy_section">
<p><b>How May We Share Your Information?</b></p>
<p>Except for the following situations we do not rent, sell, or share your information with other people or companies:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sharing Your Information with Subcontractors.</span> In our efforts to provide the best quality service and experience to you, we may share information with subcontractors that provide us with services. These services may include, among other things, helping to provide services that you request, helping to create or maintain our databases, helping to research and analyze the people who request services information from us, and/or helping to process payment card information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sharing Your Information as Permitted by Law.</span> We may share your information with others as required by, or permitted by, law. This may include sharing your personally identifiable information with governmental entities, or third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal processes, or as we believe is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that we determine in our sole discretion might be brought against us.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sharing Your Information with Law Enforcement.</span> We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful, or that we reasonably believe may aid a law enforcement investigation into unlawful activity. In addition, we reserve the right to release your information to law enforcement agencies if we determine, in our sole judgment, that either you have violated our policies or the release of your information may protect the rights, property or safety of Omaze, you, or another person.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Transition.</span> If Omaze becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale or transfer of some or all of its assets, your information will be transferred to the acquiring entity. In such a situation, you will be provided with notice that a transfer of your information is imminent, and you will be given an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of your information.</p>

Unless we have your permission, we will only provide such companies with non-personally identifiable information. In other words, while this information may be provided in conjunction with a randomly assigned number, or a number assigned to your Omaze account, it will not be provided in conjunction with your name.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sharing Your Information with Charities and Prize Providers.</span> If you enter a sweepstakes, whether by making a donation or using an alternate method of entry, make a donation in connection with entering into a sweepstakes, you agree that we may share your name and contact information with the charity we designate as the benefiting charity for such sweepstakes and with any entity providing prizes for that sweepstakes, who may use your information for marketing purposes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sweepstakes Winners.</span> As further explained in our Rules, by entering into a sweepstakes, you grant us the right to disclose name, biographical information, pictures/portraits, video images, likenesses and/or voice to the general public if you are a sweepstakes winner.</p>

<p><b>California Users: Your California Privacy Rights.</b></p>
<p>We are in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Unless you provide personal information in connection with a sweepstakes, we are likely exempt from the requirements of California Civil Code section 1798.83 because we do not share such personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. However, by providing personal information in connection with a sweepstakes or rewards program, you are expressly authorizing Omaze to share your name and contact information with both the charity benefiting from such sweepstakes and the entity providing prizes for that sweepstakes. You expressly agree that these entities may use your information for marketing purposes. If you wish to find out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1798.83, you may notify us in writing at privacy@omaze.com. If you want us to stop sharing your email contact information with third parties (if we have your email contact information), you may notify us at service@omaze.com. In order to fulfil certain rewards and prizes, we must share your information. Please follow the instructions provided to you by third parties to unsubscribe from their messages. If you have opted-out as described above, and thereafter you elect to use a service or promotion that requires us to contact you or share your information with a third party (e.g., you enter into a new sweepstakes after opting-out), then your previous opt-out preferences will not apply.</p>
<p>Also, please note that we have not yet developed a response to browser “Do Not Track” signals, and do not change any of our data collection practices when we receive such signals. We will continue to evaluate potential responses to “Do Not Track” signals in light of industry developments or legal changes.</p>
