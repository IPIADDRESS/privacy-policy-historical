</p><h2>Cookies and clear GIFs</h2>
			<p><strong>What Are Cookies</strong> <br>
			Cookies are files that web servers place on an Internet user’s computer that  are designed to store basic information (such as visitor preferences). The use  of cookies on the Site allows visitors to enjoy more seamless visits and more  accurately measures visitor behavior on the Site. There are two types of  cookies that we may use: session and persistent. Session cookies exist only  during an Internet user’s online session. They disappear from the user’s  computer when he/she closes the browser software. Persistent cookies remain on  the user’s computer after the browser has been closed. The cookies used on the  Site do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser, unless  you choose to identify yourself voluntarily. You may choose to identify  yourself for any one of the following reasons: by asking the browser to remember  your username and password, by responding to a promotional offer, or by  personalizing a web page or requesting more information on a product or  service. </p>
<p><strong>How We Use Cookies</strong> <br>
	When you interact with the Site, we strive to make that experience easy, meaningful,  and relevant. When you come to the Site, our web server uses cookies to improve  your interaction with the Site by, for example, remembering your preferences  and dynamically serving more relevant content to you. More specifically, we use  cookies to measure your behavior on the Site and to save personal settings on  specific pages. For our customers who login to our products through the Site,  cookies can also be used to save the username so that we can process the saved  login information and quickly log that user into the product. Cookies also help  us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in. We may link  personal information that you have submitted on the Site with our cookies that  are associated with your visit(s) to the Site in order to provide more relevant  content to you during your visit(s). We use cookies (that only we can read and  use) to identify the fact that you are one of our customers or a prior Site  visitor (as applicable). Visitors who disable their web browsers' ability to  accept cookies will still be able to browse the Site; however, they may lose  some of the functionality provided by the use of cookies. When examining your  cookies you may notice a cookie that is set by the following domains: 2o7.net,  omtrdc.net, and omniture.com. The 2o7.net domain is the primary domain we use  to measure visitor behavior on this Site.   The omtrdc.net domain is one of the domains we use to serve relevant and  visitor tailored content during the visitor’s session.

	You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers  automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting  to decline cookies if you prefer. If you are using a public computer or do not  otherwise want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate  radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.

<p><strong>What are Clear Gifs?</strong> <br>
	Clear gifs (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to  help Site operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A  clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel)  that is placed on a site. The use of a clear gif allows the Site to measure the  actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the clear gif. </p>
<strong>How We Use Clear Gifs</strong>
<br>
We utilize clear gifs to measure visitor behavior, to help us improve visitor experience, and to manage site content.   We, and our Subsidiaries, may use clear gifs on this Site, in our e-mails, in our advertisements on other web sites, or in our advertisements in others' e-mails.

				 <h2>Security</h2>
				 <p>The Site has physical,  administrative and technical measures in place to maintain the security,  confidentiality, and integrity of the data under our control, and to help  protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of such data. For example,  when the Site is accessed using Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer  versions 5.0, or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects  information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure  that the data is safe, secure, and available only to our customers and us. In  addition, we use secured server areas and advanced firewall technology to  minimize the risk of security breaches for individually identifiable  information that is volunteered on the Site. Finally, we provide unique  usernames and passwords that must be entered each time a customer, or one of  our employees that has a business need to access the information, logs on to one  of our products via the Site. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized  access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of all  data. </p>
<p>While we strive to protect your  personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed  to be totally secure and therefore we cannot ensure or warrant the security of  any information you send to us. You send any information via the Site at your  own risk.</p>
