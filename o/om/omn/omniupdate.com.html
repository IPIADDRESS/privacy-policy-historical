                        employees engaged in the design and development of OU Campus can see a rendering of
                        the path the user has taken through the product. FullStory captures your OU Campus
                        user name, full name, gravitar image, IP address, and IP-based geolocation. Where
                        possible, OmniUpdate uses functionality that will blur user data so that employees
                        cannot see it as they watch the FullStory reproductions of the user’s experience.
                        However, the messaging and notifications feature does not support blurring of data,
                        so it is advised that users refrain from including sensitive or personally identifiable

                  <p>The OmniUpdate network has extensive protective measures in place to ensure that misuse,
                     loss, corruption, and alteration of data does not happen. To ensure the continued
                     security of your individualized information, OmniUpdate conducts periodic reviews
                     of our security infrastructure, regularly updating our practices to meet the highest
                     technological and data protection industry standards. We protect unauthorized access
                     and inappropriate use of sensitive data at both the hardware and software levels,
                     including the use of properly configured network firewalls, Secure Socket Layers (SSL),
                     and VPN technologies for data in transit and encryption for data storage. Our products
                     also incorporate advanced security features and methods, including encoded session
                     identifications and dynamic data. The OmniUpdate team is also committed to internal
                     policies that dictate exactly how employees may use and access secure data.
