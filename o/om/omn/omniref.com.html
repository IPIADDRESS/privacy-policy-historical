also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are 
opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more 
accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. </p><p>We may also collect analytics data, 
or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for

purposes, though we may collect persistent identifiers from your browser or mobile

information to our employees, agents or affiliates that a) need to know that 
information in order to process it for us or to provide other services, and 
b) have agreed not to disclose it to others.</p><p>While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches, no 
website or internet transmission is completely secure and we cannot guarantee 
that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or other breach will never occur. 
In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result 
of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the 
situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may 
have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable 
laws and regulations.</p><h3>Children's Privacy</h3><p>This Website is not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not

this policy. If we do update it, we’ll notify you by posting the new policy on
