<h1 id="H1Title">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This policy describes the ways we collect, store, use and protect your  personal information. You accepted this policy when you signed up for  our Service. We may amend this policy at any time by posting a revised  version on our website. The revised version will be effective at the  time we post it. In addition, if the revised version includes a  substantial change, we will provide you with 30 days’ prior notice by  posting notice of the change on OKPAY website.</p>
<p>Throughout this policy, we use the term "Personal Information"  to  describe information that can be associated with a specific person and  can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal  information to include information that has been anonymized so that it  does not identify a specific user.</p>
<h2 id="1">1. Personal Information Collection</h2>
<p>1.1. When you visit the OKPAY website, we collect your IP address and  standard web log information, such as your browser type and the pages  you accessed on our website.</p>
<p>1.2 If you open an account, we collect the following types of information from you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact information - your name, address, phone, email, instant messenger ID and other similar information.</li>
<li>Financial information - the full bank account numbers and credit card numbers that you link to your OKPAY account.</li>
</ul>
<p>1.3 Before  permitting you to use our Service, we may require you to provide  additional information we can use to verify your identity or address or  manage risk, such as your date of birth, passport or  other information. We may also obtain information about you from third  parties such as credit bureaus and identity verification services.</p>
<p>1.4. When  you are using our Service, we collect information about your account  transactions and we may collect information about your computer or  other access device for fraud prevention purposes.</p>
<p>1.5 Finally,  we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways  not specifically described here. For example, we may collect  information related to your contact with our customer support team or  store results when you respond to a survey.</p>
<h2 id="2">2. Cookies</h2>
<p>2.1. When you access our website, we, or companies we hire to track how  our website is used, may place small data files called "cookies" on  your computer.</p>
<p>2.2. We send a "session cookie" to your  computer when you log in to your account. This type of cookie helps us  to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the  same session, so that we don’t need to ask you for your password on  each page. Once you log out or close your browser, this cookie expires  and no longer has any effect.</p>
<p>2.3. We also use longer-lasting  cookies for other purposes such as to display your e-mail address on  our sign-in form, so that you don't need to retype the e-mail address  each time you log in to your account.</p>
<p>2.4. We encode our  cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them.  You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing  so may interfere with your use of our website. We may also collect information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk  and for fraud prevention purposes.</p>
<h2 id="3">3. Personal Information Protection</h2>
<p>3.1.  We store and process  your personal information on extremely secured dedicated servers, and we protect it  by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in  compliance with applicable government regulations. We use  computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce  physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize  access to personal information only for those employees who require it  to fulfill their job responsibilities.</p>
<h2 id="4">4. Use of Personal Information</h2>
<p>4.1. Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide  you with a secure, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We may  use your personal information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide the services and customer support you request;</li>
<li>process transactions and send notices about your transactions;</li>
<li>resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;</li>
<li>prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our <a href="terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a>;</li>
<li>customize, measure, and improve our services and the content and layout of our website;</li>
<li>send you targeted marketing, service update notices, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences;</li>
<li>compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5">5. Sharing Information with OKPAY Users</h2>
<p>5.1. To process your payments, we may need to share some of your personal  information with the person or company that you are paying or is paying  you. Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments  you have received from verified OKPAY users, and whether you have  verified control of a bank account are provided to other OKPAY users  who you transact with through OKPAY. Additionally, you can provide to OKPAY users any information about your account by filling in a special form <strong>My Account</strong> -&gt; <strong>Profile</strong> -&gt; <strong>Account</strong> -&gt; <strong>Public Information</strong>.</p>
<p>5.2. If you are buying  goods or services and pay through OKPAY, we may also provide the  seller with your address to help complete  your transaction with the seller. The seller is not allowed to use this  information to market their services to you unless you have agreed to  it. If an attempt to pay your seller fails, or is later invalidated, we  may also provide your seller with details of the unsuccessful payment.  To facilitate dispute resolutions, we may provide a buyer with the  seller’s address so that goods can be returned to the seller.</p>
<p>5.3. We  work with merchants to enable them to accept payments from you using OKPAY. In doing so, a merchant may share information about you with  us, such as your email address, when you attempt to pay that merchant.  We use this information to confirm to that merchant that you are a OKPAY customer and that the merchant should enable OKPAY as a form of  payment for your purchase. Also, if you request that we validate your status as an OKPAY customer with a third party, we will do so. Please note that merchants you buy from and contract with have their own privacy policies, and OKPAY may not be held responsible for their operations, including, but not limited to, their information practices.</p>
<p>5.4. Regardless,  we will not disclose your credit card number or bank account number to  anyone you have paid or who has paid you through OKPAY, except with  your express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with a  subpoena or other legal process.</p>
<h2 id="6">6. Sharing Information with Other Parties</h2>
<p>6.1. We may share your personal information with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Members  of the OKPAY Inc. corporate family -- to provide joint content and services (like registration,  transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent  potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide  decisions about their products, services and communications. Members of  our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing  communications only if you have requested their services.</li>
<li>Service  providers under contract who help with parts of our business  operations; (fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, technology  services). Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use  your information in connection with the services they perform for us  and not for their own benefit.</li>
<li>Financial institutions  that we partner with to jointly create and offer a product such as the  OKPAY credit card where we share information with partner bank  to determine whether you should receive pre-approved offers for the  OKPAY credit card. These financial institutions may only use this  information to market OKPAY-related products, unless you have given  consent for other uses.</li>
<li>Credit bureaus to report account information, as permitted by law.</li>
<li>Banking  partners as required by credit card association rules for inclusion on  their list of terminated merchants (in the event that you meet their  criteria which includes having OKPAY close your OKPAY Account due to  your breach of the OKPAY Terms of Service).</li>
<li>Companies  that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a  combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow  this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your  personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will  receive prior notice.)</li>
<li> Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when
<ul type="circle">
<li>we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure</li>
<li>we need to do so to comply with law</li>
<li>we  believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is  necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report  suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our Terms of Service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>6.2. OKPAY  will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties  for their marketing purposes and only shares your personal information  with third parties as described in this policy.</p>
<p>6.3. If you open an OKPAY account directly on a third party website or application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on an OKPAY website) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or application.</p>
<h2 id="7">7. Restrict from Sharing your Personal Information</h2>
<p>7.1. Federal and state laws allow you to restrict the sharing of your  personal information in certain instances. However, these laws also  state that you cannot restrict other types of sharing. Because we have  chosen to refrain from certain types of data sharing, the only type of  sharing of your personal information that you may restrict is as  follows: <br>
If you do not want OKPAY to share your personal  information with other financial institutions for the purpose of  marketing our jointly offered products to you, please log in to your  account and uncheck the appropriate box in the <strong>My Account</strong> -&gt; <strong>Profile</strong> -&gt; <strong>Account</strong> -&gt; <strong>Notifications</strong>.</p>
<p>7.2. You can also control how we use your contact information to market our services to you in the notifications preferences.</p>
<h2 id="8">8. Accessing and Changing your Personal Information</h2>
<p>You can review and edit your personal information at any time by logging in to your account and clicking the <strong>Profile</strong> link.</p>
<h2 id="9">9. Contact Us About Privacy Questions</h2>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy, you should contact us by using <a href="/support/" target="_self">this form</a>.</p>
