				<h2>Web Sites Covered</h2>

				<p>Okta has established this Privacy Policy to help you to understand how Okta collects and uses personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy covers the information practices of Web sites that link to this Privacy Policy, including, but not limited to <a href="http://www.okta.com">http://www.okta.com</a>.</p>

				<p>Okta's Web sites may contain links to other Web sites. Okta is not responsible for the information practices or the content of such other Web sites. The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of other Web sites to understand their information practices.</p>

				<h2>Information Collected by Okta</h2>

				<p>Okta offers a variety of applications and services that are collectively referred to as the "Services". Okta collects information from individuals who visit the Company's Web sites ("Visitors") and individuals whose employer has elected to use the Services ("Users").</p>

				<p><strong>Personal Information You Provide to Us</strong>. We receive and store any information you enter when expressing an interest in obtaining more information about the Service, registering and using the Service, or provide to us in any other way. For example, when expressing an interest in obtaining information about the Services or registering to use the Services on Our web site, Okta may require you to provide personal contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, email address, and any other information necessary for us to provide you with access to the various aspects of the Services (collectively "Personal Information"). You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, improving the content of the Web site, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about Okta's Services, including specials and new features. </p>

				<p><strong>Personal Information Collected Automatically.</strong> As you navigate or interact with Okta's Web sites and Services, Okta may also automatically collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons. </p>

				<ol>
					<li><strong>Cookies</strong>
						<p>Okta uses cookies to make interactions with the Services easy and meaningful. When you visit or interact with the Services, Okta's servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Okta, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a "Contact Me" or a "30 Day Free Trial" Web form), Okta has no way to associate this cookie data with your Personal Information.</p>
						<p>Okta uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you log out of the Okta Service, close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.</p>
						<p>If you have chosen to identify yourself to Okta, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Services, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed your browser. These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Services and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use many features of the Services.</p>
						<p>Okta also uses an opt-in persistent cookie to remember your username. This opt-in persistent cookie allows you to log into the Okta Service without entering your username every time you use the Service.</p>
					<p>	Most browsers have an option for turning off cookies, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies activated, however, because many aspects of the Service require that cookies be enabled in order to function properly. </p>
						<p>Okta's Service connects users to third party services, with whom Okta partners with to provide the Service. The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by our privacy statement.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.  Our partners use session ID cookies to manage a user's connection to the partner's service.  </p>

					</li>
					<li><strong>Web Beacons </strong>
						<p>Okta uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about your usage of the Web site and Services, interaction with emails from the Company, and to operate and improve the Services. Web beacons are invisible electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as (1) cookies, (2) the time you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon, or (3) a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>IP Addresses and Browser Information</strong>
						<p>When you visit or use the Services, the Company collects your Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses, browser information and operating system to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, Okta uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Users and Visitors navigate the Company's Web sites. </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Other Third Party Tracking</strong>
						<p>Okta engages third parties, which use web beacons, images, and scripts, to help us better manage content on our website. For example, Okta's uses third parties to assist in marketing initiatives and such third parties may use web beacons to better track the effectiveness of Our campaigns. Okta does not provide Personal Information to the third parties but We may tie the information gathered from third party tracking to our Users' or Visitors' Personally Identifiable information for marketing purposes.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Use of Information Collected</h2>
				<p>Okta also collects IP addresses from Users when they log into the Services as part of the Company's "Identity Confirmation" and "IP Range Restrictions" security features.
				Okta may use the collected Personal Information and other information Okta collects about your use of the Service to operate and make the Service available to you; for billing, identification and authentication; to send updates about our company and our products; to contact you about your use of the Service; for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service and Web site.</p>

				<p>Okta may also transmit or share your Personal Information with its third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other technology and services required to operate and maintain the Service, which may require that your Personal Information be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Okta and the authorized third parties referred to in this paragraph. Unless we tell you differently, Okta's agents and service providers do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.</p>

				<p>We may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on the Website in which we ask persons who choose to participate for contact information (like an e-mail address) or demographic information (like a zip code, industry or country). We may use the data we collect from you in these contests and promotions to send you promotional material about our company or our partners. Your contact information collected from these contests and promotions may be used to administer the contest and notify winners and contact you when necessary.</p>

				<p>Except as described in this policy, Okta will not give, sell, rent, or loan any identifiable Personal Information to any third party, without your prior consent. We may disclose such information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. Okta may also provide non-personal, summary or group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Services information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no Personal Information.</p>

				<p>If Okta is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets,  you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>

				<h2>Protection of Information</h2>

				<p>Personal Information you enter in to the Services is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to ensure that there is no unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer (or other device) and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
				<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
				<p>Okta maintains reasonable security measures to protect your information from loss, destruction, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure. These technologies help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you provided authorized access. However, no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology is 100% secure; and Okta cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. If you have any questions about security on our web site, you can contact us at info@okta.com.</p>
