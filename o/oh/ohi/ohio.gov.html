									<br>
									<b>Usage Statistics.</b> In order to generate usage statistics to help us improve our Web site, we automatically collect information on every visit without identifying the visitor. The following information is compiled to produce Web usage statistics and is destroyed after three months:<br>
									</font></p>
									<ul>
										<li><font face="Arial" size="2">the visitor's IP address, </font>

									</li></ul>
									<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
									<b>Web Cookies.</b> The use of Web cookies is discouraged on our Web sites. Temporary cookies, however, may be used when necessary to complete a transaction. If a persistent Web cookie is required, the Web page discloses to visitors that a persistent cookie is being used. <i>Information collected on our Web sites including information from persistent Web cookies is generally subject to Ohio Public Records Law except as otherwise provided by Ohio or federal law.</i><br>
