		<p>This privacy policy applies to the information (the Site) collects about you from </p>
<p>any device you use to access products, services, software, websites, and other goods </p>
<p>and services offered, owned, or operated by (collectively “Services”). Some of these </p>
<p>Services may provide you with additional information and choices about your privacy, </p>
<p>which you should review.</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to information about you collected by third party </p>
<p>websites and offerings linked to or otherwise accessible from the Site. The </p>
<p>information collected or received by third parties is subject to their own privacy </p>
<p>policies.</p>
<h3>Collection of Your Information</h3>
<p>It is our policy to respect the privacy of the people who use the Services (each a </p>
<p>“User,” collectively the “Users”). Therefore, we will not disclose to any </p>
<p>unauthorized third party a User’s name or contact information. We will also not </p>
<p>monitor, edit or disclose the contents of a User’s information unless required to do </p>
<p>so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on
<p>us;</p></li>
<li>Protect and defend our rights or property;</li>
<li>Act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Users
