				<h1>OnDemandResearch.com <span>Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</span></h1>
				<p>OnDemandResearch.com is committed to protecting your privacy in a manner that will allow you to use our services with confidence and peace of mind. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to describe: 1) what information OnDemandResearch.com collects; 2) how we use it; 3) your control over the information you give us and; 4) how we protect your information from theft or unauthorized use. This Privacy Policy is subject to change from time to time, so please check back periodically. Use of the services offered at this site constitutes acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you have a question about the Privacy Policy please send us an e-mail message at <a href="mailto:security@OnDemandResearch.com">security@OnDemandResearch.com</a></p>
				<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
				<p>Any information that you provide through the OnDemandResearch.com registration process or responses to offers made available to you through our site is completely voluntary. You always have a choice whether or not to disclose information requested in the survey, registration or offer form or to remain opted-in as a OnDemandResearch.com user. The information we collect includes contact and postal information (such as name, mailing address and home or mobile telephone number), e-mail address and demographic information (such as age, interests and additional information). In addition, OnDemandResearch.com may present questions regarding your health. Your participation in these questions is completely voluntary. Lastly, OnDemandResearch.com does not collect credit card information or Social Security numbers. Please contact <a href="mailto:security@OnDemandResearch.com">security@OnDemandResearch.com</a> immediately should you receive a request for such information.</p>
				<p>We are able to offer our free services, in part, based upon the willingness of our users to be contacted by our marketing partners, including affiliated third party advertisers. By allowing us to make the information you supply available to our marketing partners, you will receive free product and service information that may be of interest to you. You may, at any time, notify us that you do not wish to have your Personal Information disclosed to third parties for offers and promotions by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@OnDemandResearch.com">privacy@OnDemandResearch.com</a>.</p>
				<p>We also think that you should be rewarded for the time it takes to fill out our survey. That's why we provide incentives either directly or indirectly. In part, that's also why we cannot accept information from those under the age of 18 years. Those under 18 cannot participate in sweepstakes and promotions offered by OnDemandResearch.com or the promotion sponsor. In addition, we do not knowingly collect, use or disseminate any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If, however, we become aware that personally identifiable information regarding a child under the age of 13 has been collected, we will delete it from our records. We encourage parents and guardians to participate in and supervise the online activities of their children.</p>
				<h2>How We Use It</h2>
				<p>Your information will be used to improve and personalize the offers OnDemandResearch.com sends to you and all our members. By providing your e-mail address to OnDemandResearch.com, you are agreeing to receive periodic e-mail messages from OnDemandResearch.com. OnDemandResearch.com may send you e-mail messages regarding marketing offers from other reputable organizations whose products and services we think you might find interesting. Contact, postal, e-mail address and demographic information may be shared with third party marketers for marketing purposes. Similarly, your answers to health related questions may be used or shared to market or advertise products, goods or services to you. By completing health related questions on the survey, you are consenting to the use of this information for direct marketing purposes. In addition, OnDemandResearch.com provides services for direct marketing applications including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation.</p>
				<p>In addition, by registering at any of the Sites, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR 310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the ("Rule") and applicable state do-not-call regulations. Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed at the Federal Trade Commission' Do-Not-Call List, and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule and the applicable state do-not-call regulations. In addition, by submitting your personal information to any one of the Sites, you agree to receive mobile marketing including, but not limited to, text-message based marketing, from us and our third-party advertisers and marketers. Notwithstanding that your mobile telephone number may be listed on state and/or federal Do-Not-Call registries, we retain the right to contact you via text-message based marketing in accordance with applicable state and federal law. Further, you agree that we reserve the right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute your mobile telephone number and other mobile data with/to any third-party for any and all non-marketing uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
