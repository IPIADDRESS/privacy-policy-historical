A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use "persistent cookies" to save your username and login password for future logins to the Site. We use "session ID cookies" to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor web traffic routing on the Site and aggregate usage of the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the website you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service.</li>
                                </ul>
                              <p>Policy Towards Children: We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from minors. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <a href="www.onbile.com/contact-us/">www.onbile.com/contact-us/</a></p>

                                <strong>Account Subscriptions</strong>
                                <p>If you choose to continue service with ONBILE via a paid account, ONBILE will collect personally identifiable information (credit card number, billing address, phone number) and keep this information on file in our secure server in order to process your recurring invoices. This information is only used to verify credit card authenticity, and issue invoices as per your service agreement.</p>
                                <p>Upon discontinuation of ONBILE service, your information will be destroyed on our billing system. If we are unable to process your subscription for a given month, this information, along with your account information, may be used to contact you.</p>

                                <strong>Tell-A-Friend Tools</strong>
                                <p>ONBILE provides a number of tools that will allow you to promote your website, like articles in your website, over email. Email addresses entered into these forms are not stored in our database, but may be stored in our system logs in text format to assist us in tracking down abusive users, or using these tools for spamming. We will never contact addresses logged in this manner. The email sent through any of these mechanisms is a one time email only.</p>

                                <p>Users hosting websites with ONBILE are given tools that may ask you optionally enter your email address when making comments on their website, or contacting them through their website. Since users on ONBILE can manipulate the HTML code on their site directly, there are opportunities available for a malicious user to inject code that would log your information before it reaches our system.</p>
                                <p>In addition, once in our system, website owners will have the opportunity to review and modify any information entered into their website. Since we do not have full control over how members run their individual sites, this privacy policy does not apply to any hosted ONBILE website that you do not own. You should check that you trust the owner of a particular website before submitting personally identifiable on that site.</p>

                                    <p>Any information you choose to provide in a comment or a submission on the Site or the Service will be publicly available and should reflect how much you want other users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage you to think carefully about what information about yourself you disclose in your comments or submissions. If you disclose your Personal Information to others, whether or not they are users of the Site, on our Site or through the Service or otherwise, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them.</p>

                                <li><strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</strong>
                                    <p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect our or a third party's property and rights, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable.</p>

                        <li><h3>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h3>
                            <p>Our users may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information, if not required to be retained by law or for legitimate business reasons. If you completely delete all such information, your account may be deactivated.</p>
                            <p>In addition, we may delete any information provided by you or related to you, pursuant to our policies as then in effect.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><h3>Log Files</h3>
                            <p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
                            <p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><h3>Cookies</h3>
                            <p>Like most websites, we use small bits of data called cookies stored on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection. Cookies let us 'remember' information about your preferences and passwords and allow you to move within our Service without reintroducing yourself. Members who disable cookies will not be able to use the Service, as they are required to maintain your login to our service within a browser session.</p>
                            <p>Disabling cookies does not prevent you from accessing websites published under our system, though some features of those sites may be degraded.</p>
                            <p>These cookies can be tied back to personally identifiable information only in the event that you are logged in to our Service. If you are logged in to our Service, the cookies on your computer will uniquely identify your account within our system.</p>
                            <p>This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by ONBILE only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. See the 'Third Party Advertisers' section for more details.</p>
                            <p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. See Third Party Advertisers.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><h3>Bulletin Boards/Chat Rooms/Member Websites</h3>
                            <p>If you use a bulletin board or chat room on this site, or on any ONBILE member website, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
                            <p>Certain information, such as your name and IP address are logged by our system when posting messages, and are made available to the owner of the website you are posting on. These items may be displayed to readers of the site you are posting on, depending on the settings of that particular site. If you would not like to have these details disclosed, refrain from posting messages to any ONBILE bulletin board or chat room.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
                            <p>This website contains links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed.</p>
                            <p>This links to other sites are not owned or controlled by ONBILE. Please be aware that we, ONBILE, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.</p>
                            <p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
                            <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by this Website.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><h3>Business Transitions, International Processing or Transfer</h3>
                            <p>Your information may be processed, maintained or transferred outside of your state, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>In the event ONBILE goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>
                            <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><h3>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h3>
                            <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.</p>
                            <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice within your ONBILE Website Manager interface.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><h3>Security</h3>
                            <p>We are concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ a variety of measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, we do not promise that your Personal Information or private communications will be protected from unauthorized disclosure or use. PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY PRIVILEGED INFORMATION ON THE SITE OR WHEN USING THE SERVICE.</p>
                            <p>If you receive an e-mail asking you to update your Personal Information, do not reply and please contact us at <a href="http://www.onbile.com/contact-us/">www.onbile.com/contact-us/</a></p>
