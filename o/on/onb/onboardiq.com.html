      <p> To the extent that we provide forums, blogs or bulletins that allow you to post user-generated content, such content may become available to the public and to other members of the Service. If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other users have copied or saved that information. </p>

      <h4>4.  YOUR CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
      <p> How to control your communications preferences: You can stop receiving promotional email communications from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe link” provided in such communications. We make every effort to promptly process all unsubscribe requests. You may not opt out of Service-related communications (e.g., account verification, transactional communications, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Please note that other users, such as your employer or potential employer, may contact you through or outside of the Service and OnboardIQ may not be able to control your preferences for those types of communications. </p>
      
      <p> Modifying or deleting your information. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services. You may view and modify your personal information through your account settings. We may not be able to modify or delete your information in all circumstances. For example, information we collect in the course of providing the Service is shared with our Customer and we do not control access to nor delete that information once it has been shared with our Customer. If you have any questions about reviewing, modifying or deleting your account information, contact us at clients@onboardiq.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personally identifiable information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. You can also contact the Customer directly to learn more about how the Customer uses and stores your personal information.</p>

      <h4>5.  HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
      <p> Storage and processing: Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States and in any other country in which OnboardIQ or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we will transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which OnboardIQ or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy. If you are a Customer with employees, team members or other end users located in the European Union, you confirm that you have the right to consent to the transfer of end user data to our Service and to facilities located in the United States or in any other country in which OnboardIQ or its service providers maintain facilities. </p>
      
      <p> Keeping your information safe: OnboardIQ cares about the security of your information, and uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, OnboardIQ will investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.</p>
      
      <hr class="invisible">
      <h4>6.  CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h4>
      <p> OnboardIQ does not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register as Users. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under 13, please contact us at clients@onboardiq.com</p>
