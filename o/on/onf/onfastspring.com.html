  <p><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a commonly used automated data collection tool. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or device by websites that you visit or HTML-formatted emails you open, in order to make websites work, or to work more efficiently.</p>
<p>We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags or other similar technologies on our Websites or emails to, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tailor information presented to you based on your browsing preferences, such as language and geographical region;</li>
<li>Collect statistics regarding your Website usage;</li>
<li>Provide us with information to support technical functionality of service, improve the Website experience and measure marketing effectiveness; and</li>
<li>In some cases, to enable a third party to deliver future advertising for our products and services to you when you visit certain Websites owned by such third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several different kinds of cookies, and should we be deploying cookies we (or a third party provider be deploying them in connection with our e-commerce activities) would be using one of the following common types of cookies, which may be persistent cookies or session cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Essential cookies</i></b> are necessary to provide you with services and features available through our Websites. Without these cookies, services you may need, such as shopping carts or e-billing, cannot be provided.</li>
<li><b><i>Analytics or customization cookies</i></b> collect information that is either used in aggregate form to help us understand how the Website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize the Website for you.</li>
<li><b><i>Advertising cookies and tracking scripts</i></b> are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly delivered and, in some cases, featuring ads based on your interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Website includes a cookie management tool, you will typically find a hover button at the bottom of your screen.</p>
<p>If in the future you do not wish to receive cookies you may be able to refuse them by adjusting your browser settings to reject cookies. If you do so, we may be unable to offer you some of our functionalities, services or support. If you have previously visited our Websites, you may also have to delete any existing cookies from your browser.</p>
<p><i>Do-Not-Track.</i> &nbsp;There are different ways you can prevent tracking of your online activity. One of them is setting a preference in your browser that alerts websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you. This is referred to as a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signal.</p>
<p>Please note that our Websites may not recognize or take action in response to DNT signals from web browsers. At this time, there is no universally accepted standard for what a company should do when a DNT signal is detected. In the event a final standard is established, we will assess how to appropriately respond to these signals.</p>

<p><i>“Third Party Data Collection”. &nbsp;</i>This may also include cookies placed by third parties, to deliver tailored information and content which may be of interest to you, such as promotions or offerings, when you visit third party websites after you have left our Websites. We do not permit these third parties to collect Personal Data about you (such as email address) on our Website, nor do we share with them any Personal Data about you.</p>
<p><i>Social Media Features and Widgets</i>. &nbsp;Our Websites may include social media features, such as Facebook’s “Like” button, and widgets, such as the “Share This” button. These features are usually recognizable by their third-party brand or logo and may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Website, and set a cookie to enable the feature to work properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. <b>Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. </b>Currently, we use the features and widgets (“<b>Plugins</b>”) of Facebook, Google, Twitter, and LinkedIn offered by the companies Facebook Inc., Google Inc., Twitter Inc. and LinkedIn Corporation (“<b>Providers</b>”).</p>
<p>Facebook is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“<b>Facebook</b>”). You will find an overview on Facebook’s Plugins and what they look like here: <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins</a></p>

<p>When you access one of our Websites, which contains a Plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection with the servers of Facebook, Google, Twitter, and LinkedIn. The content of the Plugin is transferred by the respective Provider directly to your browser, which then integrates it into the Website. Integration of the Plugin allows the Provider to receive the information that you have accessed the respective Website even if you do not maintain a profile with that Provider or if you are not logged in at the moment. This information (including your IP address) will be transferred by your browser directly to the Provider in the U.S. and stored there.</p>
<p>If you are logged in with one of the Providers’ services, they will be able to assign your visit on our Website to your profile with the respective Provider. If you interact with any of the Plugins, e.g. by pressing the ‟Like” or the ‟+1” button, this information will also be sent directly to the server of the Provider and stored there. The information will also be published in the social network on your respective account, e.g. Twitter, and displayed to your contacts there.</p>
<p>For more information on the purpose and extent of the data acquisition and how data are processed and used by the respective Provider as well as regarding your rights and optional settings to protect your privacy, please refer to the privacy policies of the respective Provider:</p>

<p>If you do not want Google, Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn to allocate data collected on our Websites to your profile in their service, you must log out of the respective service before visiting our Website. You can prevent the loading of the Plugins completely by using Add-Ons for your browser, e.g. the script-blocker ‟NoScript” (<a href="http://noscript.net/">http://noscript.net/</a>).</p>
<p>If you accept a session or persistent cookie, you can delete it at any time through your web browser (e.g., as soon as you leave our Ecommerce Engine).&nbsp; If you do not wish to receive cookies or wish to manage when you accept cookies in general, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Although you are not required to accept our cookies, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features and functionality of this Ecommerce Engine.</p>
<p>We and our partners use third party service providers in connection with this Ecommerce Engine and our business to gather user metrics and usage data.

<p><i>Google Analytics</i>: Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the Website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website will normally be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will shorten the IP address in EU Member States or other countries of the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. On behalf of the Website provider Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website, compiling reports on Website activity for Website operators and providing other services relating to Website activity and internet usage to the Website provider. Google will not associate the IP address transmitted by your browser with any other data stored by Google.</p>
<p>You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do so, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this Website.

  <p><strong>Storage, Use and Sharing of Information</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><em>Marketing Communications</em></p>

<ul>
<li>When you visit our sites or online services, both we and certain third parties collect information about your online activities over time and across different sites to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. These third parties may place or recognize a unique cookie or other technology on your browser (including the use of pixel tags). Where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent prior to processing of your information for the purpose of interest-based advertising.You may see our ads on other websites or mobile apps because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users based on a range of factors, including demographic data, users’ inferred interests and browsing context (for example, the time and date of your visit to our Sites, the pages that you viewed, and the links that you clicked on). This technology also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and understand if you have seen one of our advertisements.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you visit this Ecommerce Engine for the purposes of conducting a purchase transaction, we require and will process certain of your Personal Data for the purposes listed below in order for us to perform our obligations under such purchase transaction and corresponding contract. If you do not provide the required Personal Data, you will be unable to complete such purchase transaction on this Ecommerce Engine:</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Our Use of Anonymous Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>We may use anonymous information (i.e. information that does not allow direct or indirect identification of the individual to whom such information relates) collected by us:</p>

<li>to provide reporting to our current and prospective partners and service providers; and</li>
<li>for statistical or research and analysis purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we may anonymize Personal Data by removing any information that identifies you specifically, and use the rest for the purposes set forth above.</p>
<p><i>Our Partners.</i>&nbsp;When we make products available for sale through an Ecommerce Engine, we are doing so as an independent e-commerce reseller of, or service provider for, the partner whose name and/or logo appears as part of the particular Ecommerce Engine. In connection with your purchase of a product or service through an online store we operate that is co-branded with our partner’s branding, we will provide certain of the Personal Data and/or anonymous information you provide in connection with your purchase to that partner for reporting purposes, to allow our partner or its service provider to register your purchase, to enable your access to products or services provided by our partner or its suppliers, to facilitate warranty, technical support or after-sales service, to allow our partner or its subcontractor to send communications to you if you have previously consented to receive them, to allow our partner or its service provider to provide services in connection with this Ecommerce Engine such as customer support or single sign-on functionality on this Ecommerce Engine and our partner’s Website, or for similar purposes in order to fulfill obligations to you.</p>
<p>We may also provide certain of the Personal Data you provide in connection with your purchase to the publisher or manufacturer of a product you purchase, or operator of a service for which you purchase a service use right from us, if different than the partner whose name and/or logo appears on this Ecommerce Engine.&nbsp; The privacy policy of our partner, and of the publisher, manufacturer or operator of the product or service you purchase, will govern how that party uses and protects any of your Personal Data that we provide to them.</p>
<p><i>Our Service Providers</i>. We use other companies, which may include but not limited to present or future corporate affiliates, to provide joint services or certain services to us or on our behalf and help us to operate our business. We may share your information with our service providers in connection with their provision of services to us.</p>
<p>We may also allow these companies to use anonymous information, and to use aggregated Personal Data on an anonymous basis (i.e., where the aggregated data cannot identify you personally), for their business purposes.&nbsp; We will not share your Personal Data with our affiliates or unrelated third parties to use for their own marketing purposes without your consent. We select our partners and service providers on the basis of their security and confidentiality commitments and their compliance with EU Data Protection Laws.</p>
<p><i>To Comply With Legal Requirements, Cooperate With Law Enforcement, Prevent Fraud and Other Crimes, and Protect Legal Rights, Ecommerce Engine, You and Others</i>. To the extent not expressly prohibited by applicable law, we may disclose Personal Data we collect on this Ecommerce Engine without notifying you when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate: (a) &nbsp;to comply with the law or a regulatory requirement; (b) to comply with governmental, administrative or judicial process, requirement or order, such as a subpoena or court order; (c) to cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental investigations (without necessarily requiring the law enforcement or government agency requesting the information to formally serve us with a subpoena); (d) to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (e) to enforce a contract; to protect the legal rights, property or safety of FastSpring, its corporate affiliates, and their respective employees, clients and partners and agents, other users or the public in general; or (f) to protect your vital interests if determined necessary by us. In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we may share our server logs – which contain visitors’ IP addresses – with the appropriate investigative authorities who may use that information to trace and identify individuals. We also reserve the right to report to appropriate law enforcement or government agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe are or may be in violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations without providing notice to you.</p>
<p><i>In Connection With Corporate Events</i>. If one of our corporate affiliates or a third party has acquired our business, specific assets or the business of one of our operating divisions through which you have provided information to us, for example, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation, your Personal Data may become owned by that company in compliance with applicable EU Data Protection Laws. In that event, the acquiring company’s use of your Personal Data will still be subject to this Privacy Statement, any applicable Supplemental Privacy Notices, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.</p>
<p>Pursuant to EU Data Protection Laws, we retain your Personal Data only to achieve the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement. We will therefore retain Personal Data as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal Data used for shipping and billing: 2 years after your last order ;</li>
<li>Payment Information: only for the duration of the payment ;</li>
<li>Personal Data used for marketing purposes: 3 years after the last contact with you (e.g. : request for information)</li>
</ul>
<p>After these periods, we will delete the corresponding Personal Data.</p>

  <p><strong>Privacy Shield</strong></p>
<p>FastSpring has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.

<p>If you are a consumer, any dispute relating to the Privacy Statement or to its interpretation may be referred to the Consumer Affairs Ombudsman as provided for by the provisions of L611-1 and following of the Consumer Code and as indicated on the tab of the Ecommerce Engine “Mediation”. Failing such agreement, the dispute shall be submitted to the competent court of the place where you live, or to the place where the service is performed, or to the place of the harmful event, at your option.</p>

<p>We strive to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the Personal Data in our databases and to keep that information up-to-date. We provide ways for you to access your Personal Data as required by applicable law, so that you can correct inaccuracies or update your Personal Data. You have the right on legitimate grounds to: (i) ask for the erasure of your Personal Data; or (ii) object to the processing of your Personal Data. With respect only to the Personal Data you have provided to us either via a consent or that we process in order to perform our contractual obligations to you, you have the right to data portability.</p>
<p>If you would like to exercise one of these rights, please contact us by postal mail addressed to us, ATTN: Privacy Department, at 801 Garden Street, #201, Santa Barbara, CA 93101, United States of America or by e-mail at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@fastspring.com">privacy@fastspring.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you contact us we may, for your protection, ask you for additional information to verify your identity. In most cases, we will provide the access you request, correct or delete any inaccurate Personal Data you discover, cease the processing of your Personal Data and implement your guidelines. We reserve the right, however, to limit or deny your request to the extent permitted by applicable law if the disclosure may lead to a breach of applicable law and regulation, e.g. in case of any legal obligation to retain certain data, or if you have failed to provide sufficient evidence to verify your identity.</p>
<p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in your jurisdiction if you believe that our processing of your Personal Data infringes the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
