<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>Updated: September 5, 2007</p>
<p>OnForce has created this Privacy Statement in order to
demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. This Privacy Statement is
hereby incorporated in our Terms and Conditions of Use and by
registering for our service, you accept the terms of this Privacy
Statement.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<strong>Notification of Changes</strong>
	<p>We may update this Privacy Statement from time to time as our services
	change and expand. If we update this Privacy Statement, we will post
	the updated User Policy on this page. Unless otherwise provided
	below, the revised terms will take effect when they are posted. Once
	any changes that we make to this Privacy Statement become effective,
	your continued use of the Platform after such time will signify your
	acceptance of the new terms. If we are going to use your Personally
	Identifiable Information (as defined below) in a manner different
	from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you and
	you will have a choice as to whether or not we use your Personally
	Identifiable Information in this different manner. In addition, if
	we make any material changes in our privacy practices that affect
	user information already stored in our database, we will notify
	Users of the change and solicit Users for their express acceptance
	of that change.
	</p>
	</li><li><strong>This Site contains links to other Sites</strong>
	<p>OnForce
	is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any
	other web sites to which the Platform links or which link to the
	Platform. By clicking on a link, logo or other item, please note
	that you may no longer be on the Platform. To check what Internet
	location you are on, note the URL at the top and/or bottom of your
	browser. We encourage you to read the posted Privacy Statement of
	that web site whenever interacting with any web site not operated by
	OnForce.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>Information	We Gather During Registration</strong>
	<p>If you register to buy or sell services on the Platform, we collect and
	store information that specifically identifies you or your account
	("Personally Identifiable Information"). This Personally
	Identifiable Information is limited to the information necessary to
	transact business on the Platform. At this time,
	the most information you would be required to submit is information
	about your computer skills, abilities to perform computer service
	work, your first name, last name, password, street address, city,
	state, zip/postal code, country, and email address.  For tax
	purposes, Professionals are also required to provide their Federal Tax
	ID (as applicable in the United States) and GST Number (as
	applicable in Canada).  Buyers and Professionals wishing to pay for
	various fees or service retainers via credit card are also required
	to enter a valid credit card number and name as it appears on the
	credit card. Other information requested on our registration page,
	including the ability to receive promotional offers from OnForce, is
	optional. We may, in the future, include other optional requests for
	information from you, to help us to tailor the Platform for you and
	deliver personalized information to you. We may supplement our
	information with additional information purchased from third parties
	for marketing purposes. Credit card information will be transmitted
	via SSL encryption for your protection.  We shall retain your
	Personally Identifiable Information for a period of seven years from
	the date upon which it is collected/the date upon which you cease
	conducting transactions on the Platform.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>Buyer Command Center, Work Order Management Platform &amp; Online
	Office</strong>
	<p>These areas of the Platform are for the benefit of Users. The private and shared
	areas of the Platform help to facilitate communication and the
	exchange and sharing of information between Buyers and Professionals
	once a work order has been created and accepted. The information
	contained in work orders is accessible by OnForce, the contracting
	Buyer and the contracting Professional.  OnForce may use non-Personally
	Identifiable Information from a work order (e.g., the scope of work
	or spend limit) for statistical analysis, product development,
	marketing, and research.  OnForce reserves the right to monitor
	communications throughout our Platform, and if we believe that a
	User is violating any of our agreements; international, federal or
	state laws; and/or our stated policies, we may terminate such usage.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>Affiliates</strong>
	<p>If you sign up under one of the OnForce affiliate or referral programs,
	you will be required to provide: a User ID, a password, email
	address, city, state, country and zip/postal code. The referral
	program requests the User ID of a referrer and your phone number as
	optional information. The affiliate program will also require a
	contact name, phone number, street address, phone number, tax
	classification and, for US Affiliates only, your Social Security
	Number for tax purposes. It further requests the URL of your web
	site, the number of registered Users on your site, and a brief
	general description of your site. We will use this information for
	our own internal purposes, including evaluating and developing new
	features that better meet the needs of our affiliates. We will use
	the email address that you provide to us to contact you regarding
	the status of your affiliate or referral program account and we will
	use the address that you provide to us to send you any payments owed
	to you under the terms of the affiliate or referral programs.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>Online Surveys and Contests</strong>
	<p>Occasionally OnForce conducts online user surveys to collect information about
	our Users' preferences. These surveys are optional and if you choose
	to respond, your responses will be kept anonymous. Similarly, we may
	offer contests to qualifying Users in which we ask for contact and
	demographic information such as name, email address and mailing
	address. None of this information is shared with third parties,
	except in summary form, if at all. The demographic information that
	OnForce collects in the registration process and through online
	surveys is used to help us improve our services to meet the needs
	and preferences of our Users. This may include targeting advertising
	to you about our services. Information we gather through a contest
	may also be disclosed to third parties as necessary for prize
	fulfillment and other aspects of any contest or similar offering.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>The	OnForce Payment System</strong>
	<p>OnForce
	offers a payment system that allows Buyers and Professionals to pay with
	a credit card (the "Payment System"). If you make use of
	the Payment System, OnForce will collect your credit card number
	and/or other entered financial institution information and will use
	that information to bill your membership fee and/or to perform the
	billing operation on behalf of the Professional, including but not
	limited to the use and disclosure of such credit card number and
	information to third parties as necessary to complete such billing
	operation. Verification of credit information, however, is
	accomplished solely by the User through the PIN authentication
	process.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>Automatically Gathered Information</strong>
	<p>OnForce
	automatically collects your browser type and browser software
	version to tailor the presentation of the services to your browser
	and to maintain a record of your activity on the Platform. OnForce
	uses cookies to enable Users to specify unique preferences and to
	track User trends and patterns. Users always have the option of
	disabling cookies via their browser preferences. If you disable
	cookies on your browser, please note that some parts of our Platform
	may not function as effectively or may be considerably slower. As an
	automatic process, our web server software records a log file of IP
	addresses that access the Platform. We also collect IP address
	information but do not ordinarily link IP addresses to Users'
	Personally Identifiable Information. However, we can and will use IP
	addresses to identify a User when we, in our sole discretion,
	determine that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our
	various policies or to protect our service, Platform, customers or
	others.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>Service Professional Profile</strong>
	<p>As part of registration, you may set up your Professional Command Center describing your
	computer experience, rates and qualifications. Some of the
	information requested in the Professional Command Center registration is
	mandatory. If you decide to offer your services through OnForce,
	potential Buyers will look to your Professional Command Center to help them decide
	whether to make use of your services.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>How	We Use Registration Information</strong>
	<p>We use Personally Identifiable Information for our own internal
	purposes including contacting you via email to inform you about
	updates to our services and providing you with information relating
	to e-commerce transactions that you conduct on the Platform. We
	reserve the right to disclose your information as required by law.
	We do not rent or sell our Users' Personally Identifiable
	Information to third parties. We do, however, provide you with the
	opportunity to receive communications via email. You may opt out of
	receiving marketing emails at any time by modifying the Preferences
	section of your profile or by clicking on the unsubscribe link in
	any marketing email you receive from us.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>Use	of General Data</strong>
	<p>OnForce reserves the right to use the [general data ] it obtains from Users'
	use of the Platform, including all statistical information. You
	acknowledge that such data belongs to OnForce and that OnForce shall
	have the right to use such data as it determines in its sole
	discretion.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>Advertising</strong>
	<p>We may send you email communications including information that we may
	think may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving these
	marketing emails, via the Preferences section of your profile or by
	clicking on the unsubscribe link in any marketing email you receive
	from us. We do not send any of your Personally Identifiable
	Information to our advertisers. You may see a cookie from a
	third-party banner server, and this cookie comes from the
	third-party banner server, not OnForce. Again, we do not pass along
	any Personally Identifiable Information to this party.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>Co-Branded Services</strong>
	<p>OnForce enters into co-branding relationships with third-party web sites and
	companies to provide products and services to our Users. OnForce may
	share your Personally Identifiable Information, including User ID
	and password, with certain co-branded third-party service or product
	Professionals as required to provide a specific product or service that
	you request from a co-branded page or co-branded site. However,
	these third-party partners may not use this Personally Identifiable
	Information for any reason other than to provide the service or
	product that the user has explicitly signed up for. If you join
	OnForce through a co-branded site (e.g., on a co-branded
	registration page), it is OnForce's general policy not to share
	anything other than summarized or aggregated data with the partner;
	however, any Personally Identifiable Information you provide may
	also be received by the co-branded site and could be stored and used
	by the co-branded service or product provider according to their
	privacy policy. Please take the time to review these third-party
	privacy policies.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>Third Party Intermediaries</strong>
	<p>We use an outside credit card processing company to bill Users for
	retainers and services.  We believe these companies do not retain,
	share, store, or use Personally Identifiable Information for any
	secondary purposes.  OnForce uses commercially reasonable efforts to
	restrict the third party vendors from using Personally Identifiable
	Information for purpose unrelated to the provision of services to
	OnForce.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>Professionals</strong>
	<p>Work	orders created on OnForce are completed by third-party Professionals. We
	share the email addresses of Buyers and Professionals once a project is
	awarded on our Platform to enable work on the project to be
	completed. These third
	party Professionals are not allowed to use Personally Identifiable
	Information except for the purpose of providing these services.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>Comments Submitted by Users</strong>
	<p>OnForce
	constantly seeks to improve the quality of the services we provide
	and the user experience on the Platform. We value your input and
	encourage you to help us expand and make improvements to the
	Platform by providing us with any thoughts or comments you might
	have regarding our services or the operation of the Platform. You
	can submit any comments you have to us by clicking on the comment
	link. When sending us comments we may receive your email address or
	User ID and the country in which you are located. This information
	is optional. If you provide this information, we will only use it to
	acknowledge or respond to your comments. Submitting comments via an
	email will not cause you to receive any secondary or promotional
	material, unless specifically requested by you. In certain
	circumstances, we may ask for your permission to post your comments
	in marketing or promotional materials.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>Security</strong>
	<p>We will use commercially reasonable methods to keep Personally
	Identifiable Information securely in our files and systems. Our
	Payment Platform is operated using secure Internet connections,
	using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, to help protect your
	financial data. We cannot, however, guarantee the security of your
	Personally Identifiable Information, particularly, as it travels
	over the Internet.   As such, we encourage you to exercise caution
	in determining what information you disclose via the Internet.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>Terminating Your Membership</strong>
	<p>We save your Personally Identifiable Information until your membership
	with us is terminated. To terminate membership, contact OnForce
	Customer Service as indicated on our contact page. If you terminate
	your membership, your Personally Identifiable Information cannot be
	recovered and you may continue to receive email communications for a
	short period of time until we have updated all of our databases.
	After termination of your membership, your Personally Identifiable
	Information may remain on our archived database and records for a
	reasonable time as residual information. We will not use this
	residual information for business development purposes but may
	retain it and use it in connection with internal business purposes,
	such as internal record keeping and legal compliance. We will
	maintain information on Users who have been removed for violating
	any of our User Policies.
	</p>
	</li><li>
	<strong>Correcting/Updating	Your Information and Opting Out</strong>
	<p>This	Platform gives the following options for changing and modifying
	information previously provided.
