This policy expresses OnForce’s commitment to maintain the privacy of personal information that is shared with us, outlines what types of personally identifiable information OnForce receives, and summarizes what we do with this personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Sources of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>OnForce is a provider of workforce optimization solutions, which include the processing of recruitment, human resources, contingent worker and contractor information for customers and their suppliers of recruiting, staffing and consulting services.

<p>OnForce will share personal information as required by law or regulation, or in cooperation with law enforcement investigations, civil or criminal subpoenas, or when required by court orders.</p>
<p>OnForce will not sell personal information to mailing lists or share personal information to those who would use it for marketing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Security of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>OnForce employs physical, technical and operational security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, disclosure or alteration of personal information submitted to us.

<p>OnForce employees may contact their Human Resources representative about reviewing or updating their personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Children</strong></p>
