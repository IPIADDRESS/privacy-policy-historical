</p><p><b>ON24, Inc. Statement of Privacy</b>
</p>

<p>At ON24, Inc., we are committed to protecting your privacy and to developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience.  ON24 has established this online privacy policy so that you can understand the care with which we treat your personal information.  
</p>

<p>ON24 strives to comply with all applicable laws that are designed to protect your privacy.  Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, ON24 intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your information to countries that may not require protection.
</p>

<p>This policy details the information we gather from you, how we may use or disclose that information, and our efforts to protect it.  <!-- This policy is posted at <insert link here> -->.
</p>

<p><b>Collecting your Personal Information</b><br>
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you.  Personal information collected by ON24 is usually limited to email address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested. 
</p>

<p><b>Types of Information Collected</b><br>
In connection with your use of our site, we ask for and may collect a variety of information from and about you in different ways.  For example, when you register to use our site, we may ask for and store your and/or your business's name, address, email address, and other identifying contact data.  
</p>

<p><b>Security and Disclosure of your Personal Information</b><br>
ON24 strictly protects the security of your personal information and honors your choices for its intended use.  We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.  Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under circumstances where this policy would violate a lawful court order and/or Federal, State, or Local law, or Statute. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where ON24, its subsidiaries, affiliates, or agents are located.
</p>

<p><b>Control of Your Password(s)</b><br>
You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password, if any, including fees. Therefore, we recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.  
</p>

</p>

<p><b>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</b><br>
Some of our web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies.  A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall personal information previously indicated by a web user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them, and how to remove them. 
</p>

<p>You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. 
</p>

<p>Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our web site and your web experience.  We may also analyze information that does not contain personal information for trends and statistics. 
To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles: 
</p><li>Notice 
</li><li>Choice 
</li><li>Security 
</li><li>Access/Accuracy
<p></p>

<p><b>1. Notice</b><br>
Where ON24 collects personal information on the web, we intend to post a purpose statement that explains why personal information will be collected and whether we plan to share such personal information outside of ON24 or those working on ON24's behalf.  ON24 does not intend to transfer personal information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on ON24's behalf unless such transfer is legally required. 
</p>

<p><b>2. Choice</b><br>
You may choose whether or not to provide personal information to ON24. The notice we intend to provide where ON24 collects personal information on the web should help you to make this choice.  If you choose not to provide the personal information we request, you can still visit ON24's web site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you. 
</p>

<p>If you chose to have a relationship with ON24, such as a contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship. 
</p>

<p><b>3. Security</b><br>
Wherever your personal information may be held within ON24 or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the personal information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. 
</p>

<p>ON24 employs the most up-to-date and industry-standard encryption methods, including firewalls.  We restrict access to any registered user portions of our site to computers running web browsers that support Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.  We use industry standard practices to insure your personally identifiable information is secure, including firewalls.
</p>

<p>Regardless of the precautions taken by us, ON24 cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk.  ON24 reserves the right to change this policy at any time without prior notice. Revisions will be posted on our web site. This statement of privacy is for the information of our users and does not constitute a contract or modification of any contract.
</p>

<p><b>4. Access/Accuracy</b><br>
To the extent that you do provide us with personal information, ON24 wishes to maintain accurate personal information.  Where we collect personal information from you on the web, our goal is to provide a means of contacting ON24 should you need to update or correct that information.  If for any reason those means are unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates and corrections about your personal information to <a href="mailto:privacy@ON24.com">privacy@ON24.com</a> and we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your personal information that we hold as soon as practicable. 
</p>

<p><b>Consent and Changes to the Privacy Policy</b><br>
