</ul>

<br><br>

If you are a Respondent, you will need to ask the Account Owner how long your responses will be stored in OnMyCalendar services.
<br><br>

<h3>7. Children's personal information</h3>

"Minors" are individuals under the age of 13. We do not use Minors' data for targeted marketing and/or advertisements, or rent or sell it to anyone.
<br><br>

Our services are not designed or intended for Minors to be Account Owners or Users. OnMyCalendar does not knowingly collect personal data from Minors. If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a Minor, we may delete this information without notice. If you have reason to believe that this has occurred, please contact us at Support@OnMyCalendar.com.
<br><br>

The Childrens' Online Privacy and Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that online service providers obtain parental consent or provide notice before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from Minors. OnMyCalendar relies on the Account Owner (e.g. school, teacher, coach) to obtain verifiable parental consent to provide our services to minors. If you believe an Account Owner is using a Minor's Personal Information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at Support@OnMyCalendar.com.
<br><br>

<br><br>

<h3>9. Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>

We can make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. In circumstances where a change will materially change the way in which we collect or use your personal information or data, we will send a notice of this change to all of our Account Owners.
<br><br>

<h3>10. Personalized marketing</h3>

You can opt-out from direct marketing in your account and we provide opt-out options in all direct marketing emails. Finally, if you do not wish to see personalized marketing content on the web related to our service you can clear the cookies in your browser settings.
