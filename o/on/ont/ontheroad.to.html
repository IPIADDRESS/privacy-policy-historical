			<p><strong>Commitment to Your Privacy</strong></p>
        <p>This site is owned and operated by Devmasters Corporation (Devmasters). We understand 
        you value your privacy. At Devmasters, we want to make your experience online 
        satisfying and safe. This statement governs information you provide to us or we 
        learn from your use of this web site and tells you how we may collect, use, and 
        in some instances share this information.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Information Devmasters Collects</strong></p>
        <p>Devmasters gathers two types of information about this websites users:</p>
        <ul>
        <li class="listDefault">
        Personal information that users provide through optional, voluntary 
        submissions, such as email and online registration forms to Devmasters. Personal 
        information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, 
        including, but not limited to, your name, home address, telephone number, e-mail 
        address, and credit card information such as the credit card number, card 
        verification value, and the billing address. The types and amount of personal 
        information collected for these activities will vary depending on the activity 
        or service for which you have registered or accessed the website.
        </li>
        <li class="listDefault">
        Devmasters also gathers non-personal information through aggregated tracking 
        information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This 
        non-personal information collected includes click-throughs, IP addresses, and 
        usage data. This non-personal information allows us to better tailor our content 
        to site users needs.</li></ul>
        <p>Devmasters gathers user information as follows:</p>
        
        <p><strong>How Devmasters Collects and Uses Personal 
        Information</strong></p>
        <p>We ask the user for personal information when they register. Devmasters collects 
        personal information to provide the registered users with Devmasters content through 
        email and other content made available through the Service. The personal 
        information collected includes the users name and email. Birth date information 
        may be verified but is not retained. If you prefer to not receive additional 
        emails you are given the opportunity to opt-out of future emails when you 
        receive your first email. Additionally, you may contact us through the webform 
        available at: <a href="/about">www.ontheroad.to/about</a></p>
        <p>Personal information is also collected through billing forms used in relation 
        to any payments you are required to make for the Service. The personal 
        information collected for billing includes the users name, physical address, and 
        credit card information. Devmasters limits the use of information collected for 
        billing purposes to the purpose for which it is shared by you with us.</p>
        <p>Finally, the user may decide to enter additional personal information by 
        adding it to their Devmasters service profile. The user may allow this personal 
        information to be viewed by other users of the Devmasters service. </p>
        <ul>
        <li class="listDefault">
        <strong>Usage tracking -</strong> We track product usage data to improve the 
        services we offer to our users. We collect user traffic patterns throughout our

        addition, we track click-through information, including IP addresses, to our 
        site from the reports and emails we sent to our customers. This is done to gauge 
        the effectiveness of our communications with customers and to discourage 
        fraudulent use. However, we do not correlate this information with the personal 
        information of individual users.
        </li>
