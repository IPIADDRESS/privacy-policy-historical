<p class="subhead">PART 5: WEBMD HEALTH MANAGER - REGISTRATION, USE AND TOOLS</p>
<p>WebMD Health Manager allows you a secure place to store your Personal Health Information and provides tools and services in order to better manage your health and the health of your family. WebMD Health Manager requires additional registration whether you access it through (i) WebMD Health, (ii) your employer's Web site or (iii) your healthcare sponsor's website. Regardless of how you access the WebMD Health Manager the following apply: 
</p><p><a name="art5a"></a><b>A. WebMD Health Manager Home Page</b></p>
<p>Personal Health Information that you enter into one of the WebMD Health Manager tools is used to provide you personalized and clinically relevant information on your personalized Health Manager home page and throughout the Health Manager product. WebMD Health Manager creates a personal home page specifically for you. You control and authorize who can gain access to this page.

<p><a name="art5b"></a><b>B. Concept Unique Identifiers</b></p>
<p>WebMD Health Manager tailors the information you receive on your personal Health Manager home page to reflect your interests, concerns and personal health characteristics. We attach a concept unique identifier (CUI) to every piece of information that you provide us. For example, if you complete the HealthQuotient and indicate that you have diabetes, that single piece of information is tagged with a CUI that is specific to diabetes. Every user that indicates he or she has diabetes receives this CUI tag. Each time you view your personalized Health Manager pages, this CUI tag is matched to content from WebMD Health about diabetes, and if our automated algorithms determine that this is likely to be an important topic to you, it will appear on your personalized pages.

<p>Sponsors or advertisers on WebMD Health may use their own Cookies, Web Beacons or other online tracking technologies in the banner advertisements served on WebMD Health and in emails, special promotions or newsletters we send you. Some advertisers use companies other than WebMD Health to serve their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of Cookies or Web Beacons on our Web site. In certain situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily directing your browser to the Web site of an Ad Server or other third party acting on behalf of the sponsor, partner, or advertiser before re-directing your browser to its selected destination (e.g., back to WebMD Health to show the ad, or to the advertiser's website); this re-direction process will not be apparent to you. 
</p><p>We do not control these third parties' use of cookies or Web Beacons, or how they manage the non-personal information they gather through them. However, we do require sponsors, advertisers and Ad Servers who collect cookie or web beacon information through our Web site to agree that they will not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from our site without your consent. They have promised us they will not link any non-personal cookie or web beacon information collected by them on our site to Personally Identifiable Information they or others collect in other ways or from other sites except as may be described in connection with a particular program. For example, in connection with "Ad Links" furnished by Google, non-personal information sent by your browser to Google when you click on an ad link or submit a query may be used by Google as described in its privacy policy. In addition, WebMD Health's Advertising Policy is posted on our Web site and will provide additional detail about our relationship with advertisers and the companies that serve ads. You should review the privacy policy of other sites you visit or link to from our site to understand how these other sites use cookies and how they use the information they collect through the use of cookies or web beacons on their own sites. Certain Ad Servers allow you to prevent them from collecting data through the use of cookies. In order to do so, you must opt-out of such data collection with each individual site. Currently, you can Opt-out of Cookies for several Ad Servers by visiting the <a href="/click?url=http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">Network Advertising Initiative</a> gateway Opt-out site. This website will also allow you to review the Ad Server's privacy policies.

<p class="subhead">PART 8: HOW WEBMD HEALTH HANDLES PRIVACY AND SECURITY INTERNALLY</p>
<p>Listed below are some of the security procedures that WebMD Health uses to protect your privacy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires both a personal username and a password in order for users to access their Personally Identifiable Information or Personal Health Information. 
</li><li>Uses firewalls to protect information held in our servers. 
</li><li>Utilizes Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption in transmitting Personally Identifiable Information to our servers. In order to take advantage of encryption technology, you must have an Internet browser which supports 128-bit encryption. 
</li><li>Closely monitors the limited number of WebMD Health employees who have potential access to your Personally Identifiable Information. 
</li><li>Requires all WebMD Health employees to abide by our Privacy Policy and to be subject to disciplinary action if they violate it. 
</li><li>Backs-up our systems to protect the integrity of your Personally Identifiable and Personal Health Information. </li></ul>
<p>WebMD Health Manager provides additional protection for your Personal Health Information as follows: 
</p><ul>
<li>Maintains Audit Trails so you can know who has accessed your WebMD Health Manager record. This can be viewed by clicking on "Activity" in the Settings window, which is accessible from your WebMD Health Manager home page. 
</li><li>Provides secure messaging within the WebMD Health Manager tool so that information related to your personal health related characteristics is sent through a secure, encrypted connection. 
</li><li>Provides geographic redundancy of WebMD Health Manager servers, which enhances your ability to access your information by storing identical information at two separate, secure locations. Both sites maintain physical security through pass code locked door access and pass code authority. 
</li><li>Limits access to Personally Identifiable Information to authorized users. WebMD Health enables you to have full control over who has access to your Personal Health Information. For example, you may decide to permit your physician or other health care professional access to the personal health information you maintain within our tools. Only the person who creates a record can grant access to other users. </li></ul>
<p>Despite WebMD Health's efforts to protect your Personally Identifiable Information and Personal Health Information, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your information over the Internet may be intercepted.

<p class="subhead">PART 11: GLOSSARY</p>
<p><a name="aggdata"></a><b>Aggregate Information or Data:</b> As a website gathers individual pieces of Non-Personal Information (see definition below) from its users, it may combine similar data from many or all the users of the website into one big "batch". For example, the site may add up the total <i>number</i> of people in Peoria, Illinois, (but not their names) who are seeking information about weight loss and compare that to the number of people in Petaluma, California seeking the same information. 
</p><p>This sort of statistical information is called aggregate data because it reflects the habits and characteristics of a large group of <i>anonymous</i> people. Web sites may use aggregate data or share it with their business partners so that the information and services they provide best meet the needs of the users. Aggregate data also helps advertisers and sponsors on the Web know how effectively they are reaching and meeting the needs of their target audience. 
</p><p><a name="browser"></a><b>browser:</b> Short for web browser, a browser is software application used to locate and display web (Internet) pages. The three most popular browsers are AOL, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Netscape Navigator. In addition, most modern browsers can present multimedia information, including sound and video, though they require plug-ins for some formats. 
</p><p><a name="cache"></a><b>cache (also called cache memory):</b> Once your Web browser accesses a web page, it references that page and the graphics on it within your computer's "cache" (or more simply, your computer takes a "snapshot" of every page you visit and stores it in the "cache".) The next time you visit that same page, your download time will be quicker as the images and much of the page is already available on your computer for your browser to reference instantly instead of waiting for the page and images to download again. WebMD Health Manager does not cache pages. 
</p><p><a name="partner"></a><b>Channel Partner Web site:</b> A third party Web site to whom WebMD Health provides content and services for that web site's health channel. Current Channel Partner Web sites include AOL, MSN and Lycos. 
</p><p><a name="clickstream"></a><b>Click Stream Information:</b> A record of all the pages you have visited during your visit to a particular Web site or the services you accessed from the site or from an email. Click Stream Information is associated with your browser and not with you personally. It records the archives of your browser. 
</p><p><a name="cookie"></a><b>Cookie:</b> A small data file that is stored on the hard drive of the computer you use to view a Web site. Cookies are placed by that site or by a third party with a presence on the site, such as an advertiser using a Web Beacon (see definition below) and are accessible only by the party or site that placed the Cookie (i.e. a Cookie placed on your computer by WebMD Health isn't accessed by any other site you visit but a Cookie placed on your computer by an advertiser may be accessed by any site on which that same advertiser has a presence). Cookies can contain pieces of <a href="#pii">Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</a>. WebMD Health encrypts any PII it stores in its Cookies. These Cookies often are used to make the site easier to use. For example, if you check a box to ask that we store your user name on your computer so that you don't have to enter it each time you visit the site, it's stored in a Cookie on your computer. 
</p><p><a name="encryption"></a><b>encryption:</b> The translation of data into a secret code. Encryption is the most effective way to achieve data security. To read an encrypted file, you must have access to a secret key or password that enables you to decrypt it. This is typically done by secure computer systems. 
</p><p><a name="firewall"></a><b>firewall:</b> A system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a public or private network. Firewalls can be implemented in both hardware and software, or a combination of both. Firewalls are frequently used to prevent unauthorized Internet users from accessing private portions of public networks. All messages entering or leaving the network pass through the firewall, which examines each message and blocks those that do not meet the specified security criteria. 
</p><p><a name="npi"></a><b>Non-Personal Information:</b> Information that is not traceable back to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual. For example, Click Stream Information is Non-Personal Information, as is information such as gender, age, city and state when not linked with other Personally Identifiable Information. 
</p><p><a name="optin"></a><b>Opt-In:</b> Means you are actively indicating your preference to participate in a program, email, feature, tool, or enhancement on a Web site. Typically, if you "Opt-in" you must provide certain information, usually Personally Identifiable Information, to the Web site or otherwise actively indicate your choice or preference to participate in the Web site program. For example, if you wish to receive a diabetes newsletter by email from WebMD Health, you must enter your email address and choose the type of newsletter by checking a box next to a statement such as: "Yes, I'd like to receive a free subscription to WebMD's Diabetes Newsletter." 
</p><p><a name="optout"></a><b>Opt-Out:</b> Means that if you do not take some action you are indicating your preference to participate in a program, email, feature, tool or enhancement on a Web site. Typically, if you "Opt-out" you must uncheck a box next to a stated preference or otherwise take some indicate action to indicate your preference not to participate in a program. For example, if you do not wish to receive promotional emails from WebMD Health or its sponsors, you must uncheck the box in your email preference center that states: "Please send me special offers and communications from WebMD Health and/or its partners that would interest me." 
</p><p><a name="password"></a><b>password:</b> A secret series of characters, typically alphanumeric (meaning it consists of both letters and numbers) that enables a user to access a file, computer, or program. The user must enter his or her password before the computer or system will respond to commands. The password helps ensure that unauthorized users do not access the system. In addition, data files and programs may require a password. 
</p><p>Ideally, the password should be something that nobody could guess. In practice, many people choose a password that is easy to remember, such as their name or their initials. This is one reason it is relatively easy to break into many computer systems. </p>
<p><a name="phi"></a><b>Personal Health Information (PHI):</b> When your Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is combined with known health characteristics. For example, if you indicated that you have a certain disease or condition, when that information is combined with your PII, it becomes Personal Health Information. 
</p><p><a name="pii"></a><b>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (also called Personal Information):</b> Information that can be traced back to an individual (contrast with Non-Personal Information and Aggregate Information). Examples of PII include your name, home address, telephone number, email address, and Social Security number. 
</p><p>If other pieces of information are linked to PII, they also become PII. For example, if you use a nickname to chat online and give out your real name while chatting, your nickname becomes PII when linked with other PII.</p>
<p><a name="server"></a><b>server:</b> A computer that provides services to other computers. A "web server" stores web site files and "serves" them to people who request them. 
</p><p><a name="ssl"></a><b>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer):</b> A security protocol developed by Netscape for transmitting private information via the Internet. SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data that's transferred over the SSL connection. Both Microsoft Internet Explorer (http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/Internet_Explorer.htm) and Netscape Navigator (http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/Navigator.htm) support SSL, and many Web sites use the protocol to obtain confidential user information, such as credit card numbers. By convention, URLs that utilize an SSL connection start with https: instead of http. 
</p><p><a name="username"></a><b>username:</b> A name used to gain access to a computer system or program. Usernames, and often passwords, are required in shared systems, such as the Internet. In most such systems, users can choose their own usernames and passwords. 
</p><p>Usernames are also required to access some bulletin board and online services such as WebMD Health Manager. 
</p><p><a name="virus"></a><b>virus:</b> A program or piece of code that is loaded onto your computer without your knowledge and runs against your wishes. Viruses can also "replicate" themselves by copying their code to other computers. All computer viruses are manmade. A simple virus that can make a copy of itself over and over again is relatively easy to produce. Even such a simple virus is dangerous because it will quickly use all available memory and bring the system to a halt. An even more dangerous type of virus is one capable of transmitting itself across networks and bypassing security systems. There are numerous virus protection programs available. See the "How You Can Protect Yourself" section. 
</p><p><a name="webbeacons"></a><b>Web Beacons</b> (also often referenced as "clear GIFs", "web bugs", "1-by-1 GIFs", "Single-Pixal GIFs", "1 x 1 Pixals", or "clear Pixals"): Tiny graphic image files, imbedded in a web page in GIF, jpeg or HTML format, that provide a presence on the web page and send back to its home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other third party) information from the Users' browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the beacon is located, the type browser that is accessing the site and the ID number of any Cookies on the Users' computer previously placed by that server. Web Beacons can also be used to place a Cookie on the Users' browser.
