            Microsoft 10 Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            (Last updated: March 2006)</p>
        <p>
            Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement explains
            data collection and use practices of the Microsoft 10 site (the “Site”) hosted for
            Microsoft by ORCSWEB; it does not apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites,
            products or services. By accessing the Site, you are consenting to the information
            collection and use practices described in this privacy statement.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Collecting Your Personal Information</strong><br>
            We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows
            us to contact you. The personal information we collect may include your name, title,
            company or organization name, work e-mail, work phone, work or home address, information
            about your job function, information about your company, and credit card information.</p>
        <p>
            The Site may collect certain information about your visit, such as the name of the
            Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you
            access the Internet; the date and time you access the Site; the pages that you access
            while at the Site and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked
            directly to our site. This information is used for the operation and improvement
            of the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Use of Your Personal Information</strong><br>
            The personal information collected on this Site will be used to operate the Site
            and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested
            or authorized.
        </p>
        <p>
            In support of these uses, Microsoft may use personal information to provide you
            with more effective customer service, to improve the Site and any related Microsoft
            products or services, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need
            for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Site to your
            particular preference or interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about
            the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications.
            Additionally, with your permission, we may send you information about other Microsoft
            products and services, and/or share information with Microsoft partners so they
            may send you information about their products and services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Microsoft occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our
            behalf, such as Web site hosting, packaging, mailing and delivering prizes, answering
            customer questions about products and services, and sending information about our
            products, special offers, and other new services. We will only provide those companies
            the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to
            maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that
            information for any other purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Microsoft may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the
            good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of
            the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the Site; (b) protect
            and defend the rights or property of Microsoft and our family of Web sites; or (c)
            act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees
            or agents, users of Microsoft products or services, or members of the public.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the United
            States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or
            agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site, you consent to any such transfer
            of information outside of your country. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework
            as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and
            retention of data from the European Union.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Control of Your Personal Information</strong><br>
            Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide
            on the Site will not be shared outside of Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries
            and affiliates without your permission.</p>
        <p>
            Please be aware that this privacy statement and any choices you make on the Site
            will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to Microsoft
            in the context of other, separately operated, Microsoft products or services.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Access to Your Personal Information </strong>
            <br>
            Customer information is collected by ORCSWEB, a Microsoft vendor. It is stored at
            ORCSWEB, plus sent back to Microsoft. You can review and edit the personal information
            you provided at this Site by sending e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@orcsweb.com">
                support@orcsweb.com</a> or writing to:

            <strong>Security of Your Personal Information </strong>
            <br>
            Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal information.
            We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal
            information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store
            the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that
            are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal
            information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through
            the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
            We use cookies on this Site to ensure the integrity of the registration process
            and to personalize the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your
            hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver
            viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be
            read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save
            you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site,
            a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
            This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation,
            and so on. When you return to the web site, the information you previously provided
            can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized.
        </p>
        <p>
            You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
            accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies
            if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience
            the interactive features of this or other web sites you visit.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Changes to This Privacy Statement </strong>
            <br>
            We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise
            the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. For material changes
            to this privacy statement, we will notify you either by placing a prominent notice
            on the home page of our web site or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage
            you to periodically review this privacy statement to stay informed about how we
            are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued use of
            the service constitutes your agreement to this privacy statement and any updates.
