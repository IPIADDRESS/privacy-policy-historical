      <p><span class="subhead">OneCoach Online Privacy Policy</span></p>
      <p>OneCoach has established this Privacy Policy to explain how it protects and  manages the personal information that it collects from you online.      
      </p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;Consent for Collection, Use and  Disclosure</strong>&nbsp;      
      </p><p>Your use of the OneCoach site and/or your registration for OneCoach products  and services constitute your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If  you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the OneCoach  site.      
      </p><p> OneCoach may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When it does, OneCoach  will also revise the "last update” date at the top of this Privacy Policy.  OneCoach may make new uses or disclosures of information collected from  clients, such as in connection with an investigation of a breach of an  agreement, contravention of laws, an emergency where the life, health or  security of an individual is threatened, the collection of a debt or in  compliance with the request of a law enforcement agency or a court order, and  in such circumstances, OneCoach will not inform and obtain the consent of the  client prior to such change.      
      </p><p> A client may withdraw his or her consent for collection, use and disclosure  at any time by sending an email to unsubscribe. Please note that, if you do, OneCoach  may suspend its provision of products and services to you.      
      </p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;Accountability</strong>&nbsp;      
      </p><p>OneCoach collects, at the time of your registration and your sign-on to its  web site, certain “personal information” (information that personally  identifies you) which may include, but is not limited to, your name, email  address, home or work address, telephone number, and information about your  computer hardware and software (e.g., IP address, operating system, browser  type, domain name, URL, access times, and referring web site addresses).      
      </p><p> OneCoach has implemented this Privacy Policy to protect personal information  received from its clients, and to respond to any inquiries. The Privacy Policy  also provides that OneCoach will use appropriate contractual means to establish  a comparable level of protection for personal information which is sent for  processing by third parties on OneCoach's behalf.      
      </p><p> OneCoach has designated responsibility for your personal information to its  Privacy Officer who ensures compliance with the principles in this Privacy Policy.  Other OneCoach individuals may be delegated to act on behalf of the Privacy  Officer.      
      </p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;Purposes for Collecting Personal  Information</strong>      
      </p><p>OneCoach collects and uses personal information for the following Identified  Purposes:      
      </p><p> (a)&nbsp; to understand client needs regarding OneCoach’s services;<br>
        <br>
        (b) to develop and provide our web site and our products and services for  our clients;<br>
        <br>
        (c) to fulfill your requests for products, services or information;&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        (d) to communicate with clients and site visitors, when necessary, and to  inform clients of upgrades, as well as of other products and services available  from OneCoach, its affiliates and third parties;<br>
        <br>
        (e) to allow clients to access limited-entry areas of OneCoach’s site;<br>
        <br>
        (f) to personalize some of our services and products for you and to deliver  targeted advertisements and offers from OneCoach and third parties;<br>
        <br>
        (g) to bill accounts and maintain payment records;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        (h) to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or  government request;<br>
        <br>
        (i) to respond to a legitimate claim, or to address our reasonable belief,  that you are violating the rights of any third party or any of the agreements  or policies that govern your use of the OneCoach site or any OneCoach product  or service;<br>
        <br>
        (j) to protect the services, products or rights of OneCoach, including but  not limited to the security or integrity of the OneCoach site; and<br>
        <br>
        (k) to identify and resolve technical problems concerning OneCoach’s site,  products and services.<br>
        <br>
      OneCoach also uses personal information in an aggregate form (i.e., not  individually attributable to you) for its business analysis, operational,  marketing and other promotional purposes.      
      </p><p> If we hire other companies to provide some products or services on our  behalf, then we will only provide those companies the personal information they  need for the Identified Purposes, and we will limit their rights to use and  further disclose your personal information as appropriate in the course of  their work for us.      
      </p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;Limiting the Collection of Personal  Information</strong>
      </p><p>OneCoach limits its collection of personal information to only that  information which is necessary for the Identified Purposes. OneCoach does not  direct its site to, nor does it knowingly collect any personal information from  children under the age of thirteen.      
      </p><p> When you visit the OneCoach web site, a cookie may be placed on your  computer or the cookie may be read if you have visited the OneCoach site  previously. OneCoach may use cookies to allow OneCoach to determine which  products and services you have already purchased so that OneCoach does not  provide redundant information to you, and, if you are an OneCoach affiliate, to  track OneCoach sales made to clients referred by you so that you can receive  compensation under our affiliate program. If you choose to not have your  browser accept cookies from the OneCoach web site, you may not be able to view  all the text on the screens, or to experience a personalised visit, or to  subscribe to certain service and product offerings on the OneCoach site.
      </p><p><strong>5.&nbsp;Disclosure,  Processing and Retention</strong>
      </p><p>OneCoach does not sell, rent or disclose your personal information to anyone  else, except:      
      </p><p> (a) to someone you have designated to act as your agent, for one or more of  the Identified Purposes (listed in Section 3, above);      
      </p><p> (b) to OneCoach’s employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries,  affiliates, consultants, business associates, service providers, suppliers and  agents, acting on OneCoach’s behalf for any of the Identified Purposes;      
      </p><p> (c)&nbsp; as necessary if OneCoach has reason to believe that disclosure is  necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be  causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally)  with OneCoach’s rights or property, other users of OneCoach’s web site, products  or services, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and      
      </p><p> (d) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law  enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related  to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law.&nbsp;      
      </p><p> In addition, as we continue to develop our business, we or our affiliates  may sell or buy other businesses or entities, or we may merge with another  company. In such transactions, personal information may be one of the  transferred business assets. Also, in the event that OneCoach or substantially  all of its assets are acquired, your personal information may be one of the  transferred assets.      
      </p><p> Your information may be stored and processed in the United States, or in any other  country in which OneCoach or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain  facilities. By using this web site, you consent to any such transfer of  information outside of your country.      
      </p><p> After your account becomes inactive (that is, if you request to be removed  from our database), OneCoach will keep your personal information in its  archives. Your information will then be used only as necessary for tax reasons  or to prove OneCoach’s compliance with any applicable law.
      </p><p><strong>6.&nbsp;Accuracy of Personal Information</strong>&nbsp;      
      </p><p>OneCoach will use reasonable efforts to keep client personal information  accurate for the Identified Purposes, and for minimizing the possibility of  making inappropriate client decisions based on such information. Clients are  responsible for informing OneCoach about changes to their personal information.  You can do this by sending an email to info. OneCoach will use new or updated  personal information it receives from clients to update its own records.      
      </p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;Security Safeguards</strong>
      </p><p>OneCoach will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect clients’  personal information.      
      </p><p><strong>8.&nbsp;Access to Personal Information&nbsp;</strong>      
      </p><p>OneCoach will afford you a reasonable opportunity to review the personal  information in your file, upon request to the Privacy Officer at info or by  writing to:

        858-792-1250      
      </p><p> If OneCoach is not able to provide access to some aspect of a client’s  personal information, it will provide reasons for denying access such as; that  by doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party, or  that it is onfidential commercial information or attorney-client privileged  ommunications, or that the information relates to a breach of an agreement or  a contravention of law, or that its disclosure could reasonably be expected to  threaten the life or security of another individual.      
      </p><p> Clients have the right to request that inaccurate or incomplete information  be amended as appropriate, by contacting OneCoach or the Privacy Officer as  described above. OneCoach will promptly correct such personal information.
