<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Commune Media, Inc. (“Commune”) understands and respects our users’ need for privacy. This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) describes the types of information we collect, the purposes for which it is used, and the choices you have with respect to its use.</p>

<p>If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we collect and process your personal data only where we have legal basis for doing so under applicable EU laws.&nbsp; The legal basis depends on the Services you use and how you use them.&nbsp;This means we collect and use your personal data only:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>To fulfill our contractual obligations to you;</li>
<li>To operate our business, including to improve and develop our services, for fraud prevention purposes, improve user experience, or other legitimate interest; and/or</li>
<li>As otherwise in compliance with law.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions about the legal basis for processing, please refer to the “Your Rights” section below or contact us at the address listed in the “Contact Us” section.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;We do not respond to web browser “Do-Not-Track” signals.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral Advertising and Targeted Ads</strong></p>
<p>We do not serve targeted advertisements in our Services at this time. However, you may see targeted ads from us on other websites based on your browsing history or other online activities. We do not participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) or TrustArc opt-out programs.</p>
<p>For more information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work.</p>
<p>You can opt out of targeted advertising by using the links below:</p>
<p>- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads</p>

<p>Additionally, you can opt out of some of these services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out portal at: http://optout.aboutads.info/.</p>
<p><strong>Your Choices</strong></p>
<p>Where appropriate or legally required, we will describe how we use personal information, so you can make choices about how your data is used. You can notify us of your preferences during the information collection process and change your selection at any time by contacting us directly.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Geolocation</em> – We collect your geographic location when you use our Services. You can restrict our access to and collection of your location information by disabling location-sharing on your browser.</li>
<li><em>Marketing emails</em> – You can choose to stop receiving marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, or by using the email address listed in the “Contact Us” section below. If you opt out of receiving marketing emails, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your Commune account.</li>
<li><em>Account information</em> – You can stop Commune from collecting information through your Commune account by contacting us and requesting deactivation of your account using the email address listed in the “Contact Us” section below.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your Rights</strong></p>
<p>You have certain rights in connection with the personal information we obtain about you. To update your preferences, correct your information, limit the communications you receive from us, or submit a request to exercise your rights, please contact us as specified in the “Contact Us” section.</p>
<p>As required by law, you have the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request access to certain personal information we maintain about you;</li>
<li>Request that we update, correct, amend, erase or restrict certain personal information; and</li>
<li>Exercise your right to data portability.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all requests, you can contact us as provided in the “Contact Us” section below&nbsp;to request assistance.</p>
<p>In some circumstances you can withdraw consent you previously provided to us or object to the processing of your personal information, and we will apply your preferences moving forward.</p>
<p>To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we may take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the information. We may also decline your access request, but in the event we do, we will provide an explanation for our decision. Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.&nbsp;If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p>
<p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.</p>
<p><strong>How Long We Retain Information</strong></p>
<p>How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described below.&nbsp;We will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, the information is stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Information about you and your Commune Account </em>– We&nbsp;retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate our Services.&nbsp;We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for the improvement and development of our Services, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you. If our Services are made available to you through our partners, we retain your information as long as required by the Partner. For more information, see "Information We Receive from Other Sources" above.</li>
<li><em>Order and transaction&nbsp;information</em> – When you place an order through the Site, we will maintain your Order Information for our records unless and until you ask us to delete this information.</li>
<li><em>Marketing&nbsp;information</em> – If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Commune account.&nbsp;We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date the information was created.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security Safeguards</strong></p>
<p>We use reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect your information from unauthorized use, access, loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. We also require that third party service providers acting on our behalf or with whom we share your information also provide appropriate security measures in accordance with industry standards. Notwithstanding our security safeguards, it is impossible to guarantee absolute security in all situations. If you have any questions about security of our Services, please contact us using the email address listed in the “Contact Us” section below.</p>
