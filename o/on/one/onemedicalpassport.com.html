<span class="boldheaderfont">Overview</span><br><br>
Your privacy and the security of the data you provide are of the utmost 
importance to us. &nbsp;Because we gather medical information we feel you 
should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture 
and use of that information. &nbsp;We understand your medical information 
is a very personal subject, and we want to make you are as comfortable as 
possible. &nbsp;This privacy statement discloses what information we 
gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. &nbsp;Questions 
regarding this statement should be directed to One Medical Passport’s 
<a href="javascript:newWindow('feedback.asp', 'Feedback')" class="act">Support</a> unit.
<br><br>
<br>
<span class="boldheaderfont">General Types of Information</span><br><br>
Information collected on the Internet can be categorized as either 
anonymous or identifiable.
<br><br>
Anonymous information is information that can’t be necessarily traced 
to a specific individual. &nbsp;This type of information provides 
One Medical Passport with data to make the site easier to use (like what types 
and versions of browsers are used). &nbsp;This information does not allow 
us to necessarily know the identity of users.&nbsp;
Identifiable information is information that tells us exactly who you 
are. &nbsp;This information is essential for One Medical Passport to be able to 
protect your personal information and allow you to access it.
<br><br>
<span class="boldheaderfont">Information One Medical Passport Gathers and Tracks</span><br><br>
Anonymous Information<br>
The One Medical Passport Web site logs IP addresses for systems administration 
purposes. &nbsp;This gives us an idea of which parts of our site users 
are visiting. &nbsp;We do not link IP addresses to anything personally 
identifiable. &nbsp;We also collect information about what types and 
versions of browsers are used. &nbsp;This allows us to enhance our site 
and ensure that nearly everyone can use it. &nbsp;Other similar 
statistics may also be collected.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Identifiable Information<br>
This information is collected in one of three ways: (1) when you 
<a href="lobby/lobby.asp">register</a>
as a patient, (2) when you fill out a preoperative questionnaire, and (3) 
when you log into 
<a href="lobby/lobby.asp">Patient Admissions</a>
 or modify a preoperative 
questionnaire.<br>&nbsp;
<br>
Patient Registration<br>
Upon 
<a href="lobby/lobby.asp">registering</a> 
as a patient on One Medical Passport, your name, address, 
phone number, date of birth, sex, a username, and password will be 
stored. &nbsp;This information is needed to uniquely identify you and 
your preoperative questionnaires.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Preoperative Questionnaire<br>
Each time you fill out a preoperative questionnaire the medical history 
you provide will be accessible to the doctor performing the procedure 
and the medical facility where the procedure is to take place.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Logging Into Patient Admissions or Modifying a Preoperative Questionnaire<br>
Whenever you enter 
<a href="lobby/lobby.asp">Patient Admissions</a>
or modify a questionnaire a log record is created for 
security purposes. &nbsp;If, for any reason, there is a question about 
who is accessing information and when it was accessed, the log file can 
be reviewed.<br><br>
<span class="boldheaderfont">Disclosure of Your Information</span><br><br>
<b>YOUR INFORMATION IS NEVER SHARED WITH ANYONE BUT YOUR DOCTOR AND 
ESSENTIAL MEDICAL FACILITY STAFF</b><br><br>
One Medical Passport will never send you a mass emailing and will only 
contact you to respond to a request or question. &nbsp;Your information 
is only provided to relevant medical facility staff and doctors when you fill 
out a preoperative questionnaire. &nbsp;A medical facility staff member may 
only access your preoperative questionnaire submission if they are 
registered as a staff member of the medical facility where your procedure is 
scheduled to take place. &nbsp;If you have not scheduled a procedure 
with a medical facility, a staff member can not access your information. &nbsp;A 
doctor may only access your submission if they are the doctor specified 
as performing the procedure. &nbsp;A doctor may not access your record 
if they are not specified as performing the procedure. &nbsp;A very 
limited number of One Medical Passport staff may also have access to private 
information (see Security Procedures in 
Place to Protect Information for a full description).
<br><br>
<span class="boldheaderfont">Organization Collecting the Information</span><br><br>
When you register with One Medical Passport the information is collected and 
maintained solely by One Medical Passport. &nbsp;Your information is not used 
for mailings, studies, or marketing. &nbsp;The information you provide 
is only used for your scheduled preoperative visit.
<br><br>
<span class="boldheaderfont">Cookies</span><br><br>
A <i>cookie</i> is a small data file that some Web sites write to your 
hard drive when you visit them. &nbsp;One Medical Passport uses a  
temporary cookie to keep your place while you are logged in, but stores 
no personal information on your computer. &nbsp;This cookie is deleted
when you exit One Medical Passport.
<br><br>
<span class="boldheaderfont">Security Procedures in Place to Protect Information</span><br><br>
Technical<br>One Medical Passport operates a secure data network protected 
by an industry standard firewall. &nbsp;Our firewall acts to allow only 
certain types of messages to pass to and from our site. &nbsp;This only 
allows legitimate One Medical Passport messages to be sent to our system and 
refuses all other messages before they can reach any sensitive 
information. &nbsp;Our systems are also monitored 24 hours a day, 7 
days a week. &nbsp;This is to ensure all of the protections are 
functioning correctly. &nbsp;We also remain up to date on all security 
advances and risks. &nbsp;As a further security measure, our database is 
not accessible via the Internet. &nbsp;All confidential information is 
transmitted using 256-bit SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption (Green Address Bar). 
&nbsp;Using encryption involves ‘scrambling’ transmitted data, so that 
if a person were able to intercept the information, they would not be 
able to understand it. &nbsp;If there are 75 or more minutes of inactivity 
within your session you will be required to reenter your username and password. &nbsp;This protects your 
information while you are away from your machine.<br><br>
Patient<br>A username and password are required to access your 
information. &nbsp;You are ultimately responsible for the security of 
your username and password. &nbsp;Please take care to select a password 
that you don’t need to write down, but that is unique. &nbsp;If you do 
need to store your password, keep it separate from your 
username.<br><br>
One Medical Passport Staff<br>Only a very limited number of One Medical Passport 
employees are allowed to access personal information. &nbsp;All 
employees must abide by our privacy policy and any violations are 
subject to disciplinary action (up to and including termination). 
&nbsp;Access to systems is restricted by using token authentication 
and is not accessible through the Internet.<br><br>
<span class="boldheaderfont">Correcting or Updating Your Information</span><br><br>
You may modify your personal information by entering 
<a href="lobby/lobby.asp">Patient Admissions</a>
 from the homepage. &nbsp;Once you have identified yourself by 
entering your username and password you may then select ‘Edit your 
personal information’ or ‘Change your password’.
<br><br>
<span class="boldheaderfont">Removing Yourself from One Medical Passport</span><br><br>
If you wish to be removed from One Medical Passport’s database for any reason 
you may <a href="javascript:newWindow('feedback.asp', 'Feedback')" class="act">contact</a> our Support unit with your name 
and username. &nbsp;Once we have verified your identity we will remove 
any existing information from our systems.
<br><br>
<span class="boldheaderfont">Contacting One Medical Passport</span><br><br>
Should you contact us through our <a href="javascript:newWindow('feedback.asp', 'Feedback')" class="act">Contact form</a> 
we will contact you by the means you have specified. &nbsp;We will 
retain your message for later referral should you ever contact us 
again. &nbsp;Your request may also be used to determine areas of the 
site that may be enhanced in the future.
<br><br>
<span class="boldheaderfont">External Links</span><br><br>
We have provided external links to other sites (such as a verifier 
of our 128-bit SSL certificate) that are outside the control of 
One Medical Passport. &nbsp;If you click these links, you will enter sites 
that may have different privacy policies from One Medical Passport.
<br><br>
<span class="boldheaderfont">Foreign Language Support</span><br><br>
If a language other than English is selected by the patient the page is translated with Google Translate.  The page contents are sent to Google, translated, and then returned in the specified language.  Google does not log any of this text.  If you are viewing the site in English no information is sent to Google.
