  <p>When you register for a OneLogin account you can be certain that we have implemented comprehensive security practices to ensure that only you and those people you provide authorized access to can see your account. We respect your right to privacy and feel it is important for you to know how we handle the information we receive from you via our website at www.onelogin.com (the “Site”) and through our on-demand support platform, tools and services offered on the Site (the “Service”).</p>

  <p>When you register for the Service, we ask for information such as your name, company name and address, e-mail address and credit card information. If you sign up for the 30-day free trial account, you are not required to enter your credit card information until you decide to continue with a paid plan. OneLogin uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on OneLogin’s behalf.</p><p>

  </p><p>You can modify your account information at anytime by clicking on the Account link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. OneLogin’s practice is not to use such personal information for marketing purposes.

We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. OneLogin may also provide non-personal, summary or group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.</p>
