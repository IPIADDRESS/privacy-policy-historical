  <h2>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE</h2> 
  <p>When you register for the Service, we ask for information such as your name, company name and address, e-mail and phone number. If you sign up for the 14-day free trial account, you are not required to enter your credit card information until you decide to continue with a paid plan. OneLogin collects information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. OneLogin works with its Clients to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.</p>

<p>OneLogin collects information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. OneLogin works with its Clients to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.</p>

<p>OneLogin has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to OneLogin's Client Administrator (the data controller). If the Client requests OneLogin to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 bueinss days.</p>

<p>OneLogin uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on OneLogin’s behalf. OneLogin also uses third party intermediaries to send out emails on our behalf and provide customer support including via live chat software.</p> 
 
  <p>You can modify your account information at anytime by clicking on the Account link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen or by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@onelogin.com">support@onelogin.com</a>. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.  OneLogin’s practice is not to use such personal information for marketing purposes. OneLogin may use the collected personal information and other information OneLogin collects about your use of the Service to operate and make the Service available to You, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact you about your use of the Service, research purposes and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service and Site. Onelogin will also send you periodic newsletters. If you no longer wish to receive these newsletters you may follow the unsubscribe instructions contained in each of the emails you receive.</p> 
 
  <p>OneLogin may also transmit or share your personal information with its third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other technology and services required to operate and maintain the Service, which may require that your personal information be transferred from Your current location to the offices and servers of OneLogin and the authorized third parties referred to here. Although OneLogin owns the software, code, databases, all rights to the OneLogin application, you retain all rights to your data.</p> 

<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
 
  <h2>COOKIES</h2> 
  <p>When you visit the Site or use the Service, we use session “cookies” – a piece of information stored on your computer – to allow the Site or Service to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to enable OneLogin to process your online transactions. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. Session cookies also help us confirm your identity and are required in order to use the Service. OneLogin uses persistent cookies that only OneLogin can read and use, to identify you as a OneLogin customer and make it easier for you to log in to the Service. Users who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site, but will not be able to access or take advantage of the Service.</p> 

  <p>The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners use session ID cookies to trace user movement on the site.</p>
 
  <h2>Clear Gifs</h2>
<p>We employ [or our third party advertising partner employs] a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie  the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>

<h2>Log Files</h2>
<p>As is true of most Web sites, we and our third party utility-tracking partners gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.</p>

<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. </p>

  <h2>INFORMATION SHARING</h2> 
  <p>Except as described in this policy, OneLogin will not give, sell, rent, or loan any identifiable personal information to any third party other than as outlined in this policy. We may disclose such information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. OneLogin may also provide non-personal, summary or group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.</p> 
 
  <h2>PROTECTION OF INFORMATION</h2> 
  <p>OneLogin maintains reasonable security measures to protect your information from loss, destruction, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure. These technologies help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you provided authorized access. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@onelogin.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy">privacy@onelogin.com</a>.</p>

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.</p>

<p>We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If you want your testimonial removed please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@onelogin.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy">privacy@onelogin.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>Surveys</h2>
<p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site.  If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information, such as email or phone number.</p>
