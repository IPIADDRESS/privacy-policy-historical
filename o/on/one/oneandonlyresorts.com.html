        <p><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong>Because Kerzner has a strong presence on various social networks, we try and make it as easy as possible to share content and to see what content is popular on those networks. We add buttons to allow people to easily share to those networks. We also use Facebook to power some of the chat functionality on the websites. When we include these social 'plugins', it gives those sites the flexibility to use their own cookies. They can't read any cookies we set from our websites, and we can't read any cookies they set, but it lets them do the same kind of traffic measuring that we do on the rest of the websites, and it also lets them know whether you're logged into their site. For example, if you're logged in to Facebook, and want to converse via the chat widget, you can do that straight away without having to log in again - we never know whether you're logged in or not, as you communicate directly with Facebook, through their plugins on our websites. Other sites and services (including, for example, advertising networks, providers of external services like web traffic analysis services and content recommendation engines) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.</p>
