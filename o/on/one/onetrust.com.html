                <h5>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h5>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Website or Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage.  We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Website and Services only to:
                        </p><ul>

                            <li>allow you to set up a user account and profile,</li>
                            <li>contact you about your use of the Website or Services,</li>
                            <li>fulfill your requests for or respond to your inquiries regarding certain products or services or employment consideration, </li>
                            <li>meet legal and regulatory requirements, </li>
                            <li>send you our newsletter or other product news, but only if you sign up for it, </li>
                            <li>analyze how you use the Website or Services, and</li>
                            <li>other purposes where you provide us with explicit consent.</li>
                        </ul>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below. If you provide us with notice that you plan on terminating your use of our Service, we will use our best efforts to promptly delete all of your Personal Information and cease any use thereof, provided that to the extent that we have already improved the Service or any product based on our use of your Personal Information (as allowed herein), we will continue to use those improvements, provided that any such information incorporated therein has been aggregated and de-identified. 
                </p>

                    We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us.

                <p>
                    We’re constantly trying to improve our Website and Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on OneTrust.com, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.  The foregoing legal notices will govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding them.  If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.

                <p>
                    We have established commercially reasonable security practices to protect Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. Among other practices, your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password  appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
                </p>
                <h5>What Personal Information can I access?</h5>
                <p>Within the Services, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us:</p>

                <p>
                    The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change.  If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at support@onetrust.com .
                </p>
                <p>
                    California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties.

                </p>
                <h5>What choices do I have?</h5>
                <p>You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p>
                <p>
                    You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above.

                <p>
                    We are the data controller for sign-up and account information that you provide to us from the European Union, but you are the data controller for any Personal Information you upload or submit through the Services, and we will only process such information in accordance with your instructions. You agree to comply with applicable data protection laws when you collect and submit Personal Information to us, such as requirements to inform data subjects about the uses and disclosures of their data. Please note that for users located in the EU, the term Personal Information used in this policy is equivalent to the term “personal data” under European data protection laws.
                </p>
                <p>
                    IP addresses: Our servers automatically record the incoming IP addresses of our website visitors, and we store such IP addresses in log files.

Some of our product offerings include the ability to host your data in servers located in the EU or other countries. To request this capability, contact support@OneTrust.com. The United States does not have similar data protection laws to the European Union. You expressly consent and agree that we may transfer and process your Personal Information to and in the United States. Your consent is voluntary, and you may revoke it by opting out at any time by contacting us at support@OneTrust.com. Please note that if you opt-out, we may no longer be able to provide you our Services.
