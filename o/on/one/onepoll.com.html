Furthermore, the Company may have access to details of your Website habits including the dates and number of times you visit the Website and the transactions you carry out through the Website.</li> <li>In order to provide the Website and Surveys we may enter into contracts with third parties for the provision of the Website, for example, our internet service provider and Website host. In facilitating the Website such third parties may have access to your Data.</li> <li>From time to time we may forward your Data to third parties whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you.
