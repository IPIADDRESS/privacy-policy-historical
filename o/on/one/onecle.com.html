<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p class="crumbs"><a href="/">Home</a>: Privacy Policy</p>

<div class="content">

<p>OneCLE is committed to protecting the privacy and security of all individuals who use our site. Our goal is to provide an Internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. In order to achieve this goal, from time to time we may collect information during your visits. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you learn more about the personal information we collect, who we might share it with, and how we protect it.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Additional terms and conditions, if any, regarding the collection and use of your information may also be provided to you before you sign up for a particular OneCLE service - privacy policies for those services will be linked from those particular areas or sections of our site.</p>

</div>

<h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>

<div class="content">

<p>OneCLE collects personal information in three ways - through information provided directly from our users, from information collected through web server logs and through cookies.</p>

</div>

<h2>Information Supplied by Our Users</h2>

<div class="content">

<p>OneCLE collects personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address, and telephone number. OneCLE may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, and legal interests. OneCLE does not collect any of this unique information about you except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you participate in an MCLE activity offered by OneCLE, the State Bar of California requires us to log your name, bar number, the time, date, location, title and the amount of California approved education credit offered for the education activity in an official record of attendance, which we are required to provide to the State Bar upon their request.</p>

<p><strong>Additionally, if you send us a cease and desist notice, letter or e-mail asking us to remove one of the contracts we retrieved from a public domain securities filing, your e-mail or letter to us may be forwarded in its entirety to the <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/">Chilling Effects Clearinghouse</a>.  At their discretion, they may publicly display such cease and desist notice, letter or e-mail on their web site.  We may also reproduce all or portions of the cease and desist notice, letter or e-mail on our own website.</strong></p>

</div>

<h2>Information from Web Server Logs</h2>

<div class="content">

<p>OneCLE records and saves information about you from our web server logs such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the time day you visited and your browser type. This information is used to verify our records and to provide better services to you.</p>

</div>

<h2>Information from Cookies</h2>

<div class="content">

<p>In order to offer and provide you with personalized services, OneCLE may use “cookies” to store and help track your information. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique user.

<p><b>Note:</b> Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies. You should be aware though that some parts of the OneCLE Web site and services may not function properly if you refuse cookies.</p>

</div>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

OneCLE may access and/or disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on OneCLE, protect and defend the rights or property of OneCLE or act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of OneCLE or members of the public. If you participate in any MCLE activity on the OneCLE Web site, OneCLE may disclose your personal information listed in the official record of attendance to the State Bar upon their request.</p>

<p>Certain OneCLE services and content may be co-branded with another company.  If you register for or use such services, both OneCLE and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.  In such cases, either a joint privacy statement or a link to the other company's privacy statement will be provided, which will provide you with information about how the other company will use the information and how you can contact the other company with requests to access the information or other inquiries.</p>

<p><strong>If you send us a cease and desist notice, letter or e-mail asking us to remove one of the contracts we retrieved from a public domain securities filing, your e-mail or letter to us may be forwarded in its entirety to the <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/">Chilling Effects Clearinghouse</a>.  At their discretion, they may publicly display such cease and desist notice, letter or e-mail on their web site.  We may also reproduce all or portions of the cease and desist notice, letter or e-mail on our own website.</strong></p>

</div>

<h2>Protecting Your Information</h2>

<div class="content">

<p>While OneCLE is committed to protecting your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any passwords you set up and/or any account information.</p>

</div>

<h2>Correcting Inaccuracies</h2>
