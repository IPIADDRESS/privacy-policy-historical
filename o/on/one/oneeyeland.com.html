	 <p> One Eyeland is for lensmen who deserve every ounce of privacy that they can lay their hands on.  why put together a comprehensive Privacy Policy that tries to address every issue that concerns you... </p>

You should use caution and review the privacy policies of any sites that you visit from ours to learn more about their information practices. </p>
	 <p> Please take a few minutes to read this agreement. By accessing the our Site, you agree to accept the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policies may evolve in the future as indicated below. </p>
	 <p> <b> THE INFO WE COLLECT</b><br>
In various places on this Site, we collect Personally Identifiable Information,such as your name, age, gender, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address or other information that can be used to contact you or identify you as an individual. For example, we collect this information when you register for membership and sign up for e-mail newsletters. From time to time in the future we may offer additional features, services, and promotional opportunities that would require you to submit Personally Identifiable Information to participate. </p>

<p> We also collect Anonymous Information such as your IP address, the type of browser you use, the pages on our Sites that you have visited, and the advertisements that you have clicked on. Your Personally Identifiable Information is linked to your Anonymous Information. </p>
	 <p> Like many Internet sites, we also use  to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer and is stored on your hard drive. When you visit our Site(s) the cookie identifies your computer to us so that you do not have to re-register each time you visit. We may also use cookies to measure the traffic to our Sites and the use of different services and features of the Sites. Advertisers that appear on the One Eyeland Site may place cookies on your computer and their use of the information stored on those cookies is subject to their own privacy policies. You should visit their sites to learn about their information practices. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to the Siteâ€™s cookies. </p>
	 <p> We do not intend that children will use our sites. We do not solicit or knowingly collect information from children under 13 years old, nor will we accept registration from them. </p>
	 <p> <b> HOW WE USE THE INFO</b><br>
We use Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to communicate with you, to process orders for products and services, to customize advertising and content available on the Site, to conduct research for internal purposes and to use such information to improve our services and the Site. If you have uploaded Artist Materials pursuant to the Submissions Agreement, you have also authorized One Eyeland to use your name and biographical materials publicly for advertising and promotional purposes. </p>

	 <p> We use information that is not personally identifiable to determine how people use our web site and its services. For example this data tells us information including how often users click on our advertisements, which files are downloaded most frequently, and which areas of our site are the most popular. Analyzing this data allows us to improve the offerings on and performance of our site(s). Using your IP address, we can also determine the general physical location of a user and may at times use this information to better target advertising to users. </p>
	 <p> <b> HOW WE SHARE THE INFO</b> <br>
Except as noted below, One Eyeland does not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties unless you give us your permission or we need to share such information in order to provide products or services you have requested. For example, we use third parties to help with some of the products and services available on our site. We also engage third parties to assist us by tracking the number of visitors to the Sites that have "clicked-through" from specified promotions on third party sites and those visitors' activities on the One Eyeland Site. When we supply personally identifiable information to these third parties, we require them to use it only for the function they are helping us with. </p>
	 <p> When you see parts of our site with a prominent brand of another company, information you supply (or authorize for use) in that part of the site will be shared with the other company that is cooperating in providing the service. Please visit that companyâ€™s site to learn more about their information practices. </p>
	 <p> We archive the Anonymous Information that we collect and exchange it with advertisers and others who are interested in our services. </p>
	 <p> We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information when required by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to conform to applicable law, comply with subpoenas, court orders or legal process served on One Eyeland, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, and to protect the property or interests of One Eyeland, its agents and employees, personal safety, or the public. Under such circumstances, One Eyeland may be prohibited by law, court order or other legal process from providing notice of the disclosure, and One Eyeland reserves the right to not provide such notice in its sole discretion.
