		  When subscribing to OMP, you will be required to submit personal information as specified on the signup page. This information will be

		  product updates and associated promotional material. It also aids OMP in providing improved global services by collating general demographic 
		  information. Please refer to the opt-out policy described later in this policy statement.<br>
		  <br>
		  <em>Information Request</em><br>
		  OMP provides the ability to request further information or ask questions to the support team by displaying email links throughout the 
		  website. If a customer elects to use such links they may be requested to provide additional information depending on the nature of the 
		  contact. Typically, such additional information may include further contact details, and in the case of technical support, additional

		  <br>
		  <em>Cookies</em><br>

		  in certain specific instances such as when a subscriber selects the auto login function in their preferences and to gauge success of 
		  internal marketing campaigns and within the use of the Referrer programs. Such cookies contain no personally identifiable information. 
		  Our partners may also use cookies. OMP does not exercise any access or control of such cookies.<br>
		  <br>

		  the number of document and file downloads, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to 
		  personally identifiable information.<br>

		  statement applies solely to information collected by this website. OMP has no control over the accuracy of information displayed by such 
		  websites.<br>
		  <br>
		  <em>Security</em><br>
		  This website takes every precaution to protect our customer's information. When customers submit sensitive information via the website, 
		  such information is protected both online and off-line.<br>
		  <br>
		  Where sensitive information is required, the transmission of information is encrypted and protected using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). 
		  This includes the submission of any payment information such as credit card details.<br>
		  <br>
		  OMP use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online and do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. 
		  All of our customer's information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who 
		  need the information to perform a specific job (for example billing administration or the development team) are granted access to personally 
		  identifiable information.<br>
		  <br>
		  ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our 
		  employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information 
		  is protected. <br>
		  <br>
		  Supplementation of Information (validation of submitted details) In order for OMP to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it 
		  is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.<br>
		  <br>
		  For example, OMP may use the WHOIS database, Government sourced companies house database or Dun &amp; Bradstreet company lookup information to 
		  validate the accuracy of supplied data. This is an integral aspect of the service provided by OMP.<br>
		  <br>
		  <em>Service Updates</em><br>
		  Established customers will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the 
		  privacy of our customers we present the option not to receive these types of communications. We also send the user service announcement 
		  updates. Customers are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which may contain important security information about the service.<br>
		  <br>
		  <em>Updating Customer Information</em><br>
		  If a customer's personally identifiable information requires specific information changes they may update the original information provided. 
		  Logging into the Manage My account and using the services provided in the Manage Account section.<br>
		  <br>
		  If customers no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners, they may opt-out of receiving these 
		  communications by canceling their membership in OMP.<br>
		  <br>
		  Customers of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our customers 
		  can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.<br>
		  <br>
		  <em>Customer consent</em><br>
		  By using our Web site, customers consent to the collection and use of information by OMP. If any subsequent changes are made to our privacy 
		  policy, we will post those changes on the policy update page so that customers are always aware of what information is collected, how it is 
		  used and under what circumstances it may be disclosed.<br>
