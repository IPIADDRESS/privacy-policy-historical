    <h3>Cookies Set by Third Party Sites</h3>
    <p>To enhance our content and to deliver a better online experience for our users, we sometimes embed images and videos from other websites on the Services. We currently use, and may in future use content from websites such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. You may be presented with Cookies from these third-party websites. Please note that we do not control these Cookies. The privacy practices of these third parties will be governed by the parties’ own privacy statements or policies. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by these third parties, using cookies or other means. You should consult and review the relevant third-party privacy statement or policy for information on how these cookies are used and how you can control them.</p>
    <p>We also use Google, a third-party analytics provider, to collect information about Services usage and the users of the Services, including demographic and interest-level information. Google uses cookies in order to collect demographic and interest-level information and usage information from users that visit the Services, including information about the pages where users enter and exit the Services and what pages users view on the Services, time spent, browser, operating system, and IP address. Cookies allow Google to recognize a user when a user visits the Services and when the user visits other websites. Google uses the information it collects from the Services and other websites to share with us and other website operators’ information about users including age range, gender, geographic regions, general interests, and details about devices used to visit websites and purchase items. We do not link information we receive from Google with any of your personally identifiable information. For more information regarding Google’s use of cookies, and collection and use of information, see the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">Google Privacy Policy</a>. If you would like to opt out of Google Analytics tracking, you can use the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a></p>
    <h3>Other Similar Technologies</h3>
    <p>Onehub web pages may use other technologies such as web beacons to help deliver cookies on the Services and count users who have visited those websites. We also may include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them as well as for statistical purposes.</p>
    <p>In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, the Services can also use other similar technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This is typically done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally.</p>
    <h3>How to Control and Delete Cookies</h3>
    <p>Cookies can be controlled, blocked or restricted through your web browser settings. Information on how to do this can be found within the Help section of your browser. All Cookies are browser specific. Therefore, if you use multiple browsers or devices to access websites, you will need to manage your cookie preferences across these environments.</p>
    <p>If you are using a mobile device to access the Services, you will need to refer to your instruction manual or other help/settings resource to find out how you can control cookies on your device.</p>
    <p>Please note: If you restrict, disable or block any or all Cookies from your web browser or mobile or other device, the Services may not operate properly, and you may not have access to the Services available through the Services. Onehub shall not be liable for any impossibility to use the Services or degraded functioning thereof, where such are caused by your settings and choices regarding cookies.</p>
    <p>To learn more about cookies and web beacons, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>.</p>
    <h3>Do Not Track</h3>
    <p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including Onehub, do not respond to DNT signals.</p>

    <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
    <p>We may share Personal Data collected via the Services with service providers. Onehub shares information with Onehub’s other third-party service providers that perform Services on our behalf, such as payment processing, web hosting, video encoding, or data storage. Additionally, we may share your information with companies that are conducting marketing and advertising to benefit Onehub. These third party companies may use your contact information for communications and marketing purposes that support our activities. You are under no obligation to respond and the companies are restricted from using your contact information for any other purpose. Onehub will ensure that any service provider with which we share Personal Data agrees to safeguard it in substantially the same manner as Onehub has described in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with all applicable laws.</p>
    <p>Onehub may aggregate information collected though the Services and remove identifiers so that the information no longer identifies or can be used to identify an individual (<strong>"Anonymized Information</strong>"). Onehub shares Anonymized Information with third parties and does not limit third parties' use of the Anonymized Information because it is no longer Personal Data.</p>
    <p>Onehub may share Personal Data if Onehub is involved in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control (in whole or in part). Onehub requires that the shared Personal Data remain subject to the promises made in the then-current Privacy Policy, unless and until you agree to a new privacy terms.</p>
    <p>Applicable law may require Onehub to disclose your Personal Data if: (i) reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant) or other legal requirements; (ii) disclosure would mitigate Onehub’s liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (iii) necessary to protect legal rights of Onehub, users, customers, business partners or other interested parties; or (iv) necessary for the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law). For residents of the European Economic Area (<strong>"EEA"</strong>), Onehub will disclose Personal Data only when permitted to do so under applicable European and EU Member States’ national data protection laws and regulations.</p>
    <p><em>California Shine the Light Law:</em> California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users who are California residents to obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of third parties to whom we have disclosed personal information (if any) for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and you wish to make such a request, please send an e-mail with "California Privacy Rights" in the subject line to <a href="mailto:support@onehub.com">support@onehub.com</a> or write us at: Onehub, 1109 1st Avenue, Suite 406, Seattle, WA 98101.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Services are not directed to or intended for use by minors. Consistent with the requirements of applicable law, if we learn that we have received any information directly from a minor without his or her parent’s verified consent, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or his or her parent or legal guardian) to inform the minor that he or she cannot use the Services and subsequently will delete that information.</p>
    <p><em>California Minors:</em> While the Service is not intended for anyone under the age of 18, if you are a California resident who is under age 18 and you are unable to remove publicly-available content that you have submitted to us, you may request removal by contacting us at: <a href="mailto:support@onehub.com">support@onehub.com</a>. When requesting removal, you must be specific about the information you want removed and provide us with specific information, such as the URL for each page where the information was entered, so that we can find it. We are not required to remove any content or information that: (1) federal or state law requires us or a third party to maintain; (2) was not posted by you; (3) is anonymized so that you cannot be identified; (4) you don’t follow our instructions for removing or requesting removal; or (5) you received compensation or other consideration for providing the content or information. Removal of your content or information from the Service does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information from our systems or the systems of our service providers. We are not required to delete the content or information posted by you; our obligations under California law are satisfied so long as we anonymize the content or information or render it invisible to other users and the public.</p>

    <p>We retain Personal Data in identifiable form only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the Personal Data was provided to Onehub or, if longer, to comply with legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce agreements and similar essential purposes. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

    <h2>The General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR")</h2>
    <p>Residents of the EEA may be entitled to other rights under the GDPR. These rights are summarized below. We may require you to verify your identity before we respond to your requests to exercise your rights. If you are entitled to these rights, you may exercise these rights with respect to your Personal Data that we collect and store:</p>
    <ul class="bulleted">
      <li>the right to withdraw your consent to data processing at any time (please note that this might prevent you from using certain aspects of the Services);</li>
      <li>the right of access your Personal Data;</li>
      <li>the right to request a copy of your Personal Data;</li>
      <li>the right to correct any inaccuracies in your Personal Data;</li>
      <li>the right to erase your Personal Data;</li>
      <li>the right to data portability, meaning to request a transfer of your Personal Data from us to any other person or entity as chosen by you;</li>
      <li>the right to request restriction of the processing of your Personal Data; and</li>
      <li>the right to object to processing of your Personal Data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may exercise these rights free of charge. These rights will be exercisable subject to limitations as provided for by the GDPR. Any requests to exercise the above listed rights may be made to: <a href="mailto:support@onehub.com">support@onehub.com</a>. If you are an EEA resident, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a Data Protection Authority about how we process your Personal Data at the following website: <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>.</p>
    <h3>International Transfers of Personal Data</h3>
    <p>Whenever we transfer your Personal Data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
    <ul class="bulleted">
      <li>European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses: We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give Personal Data the same protection it has in the EEA.</li>
      <li>Privacy Shield. Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to Personal Data shared between the Europe and the US.</li>
    </ul>
