      <p>Onehub Inc. complies with the U.S. ‐ E.U. &amp; Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department

      <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
      
      <p>Like most website operators, Onehub collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers 
        and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date 
        and time of each visitor request. Onehub’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to 
        better understand how Onehub’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Onehub may release non-personally-identifying 
        information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
        
      <p>Onehub also uses third party tracking-utility partners who use log files to collect potentially personally-identifying 
        information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Onehub does not use such information to identify its visitors, 
        however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses 
        personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
        
      <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      
      <p>Certain visitors to Onehub’s websites choose to interact with Onehub in ways that require Onehub to gather 
        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Onehub gathers depends on the nature 
        of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up as a user at onehub.com to provide an email address. 
        We also provide them the opportunity to provide additional information such as name and phone number. Those who 
        engage in transactions with Onehub – by purchasing a account plan at onehub.com, for example – are asked to 
        provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to 
        process those transactions. In each case, Onehub collects such information only insofar as is necessary or 
        appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Onehub. Onehub does not disclose 
        personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply 
        personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain 
        website-related activities.</p>
        
      <h3>Opt-Out Policy</h3>
      
      <p>Onehub offers its visitors and customers a means to choose how we may use information provided. If, at any 
        time after registering for information or ordering services at onehub.com, you change your mind about 
        receiving information from us or about sharing your information with third parties as outlined in this
        privacy policy, simply send as a request at <script type="text/javascript">document.write(String.fromCharCode(239-179,276-179,211-179,283-179,293-179,280-179,281-179,240-179,213-179,288-179,276-179,284-179,287-179,295-179,290-179,237-179,294-179,296-179,291-179,291-179,290-179,293-179,295-179,243-179,290-179,289-179,280-179,283-179,296-179,277-179,225-179,278-179,290-179,288-179,213-179,241-179,294-179,296-179,291-179,291-179,290-179,293-179,295-179,243-179,290-179,289-179,280-179,283-179,296-179,277-179,225-179,278-179,290-179,288-179,239-179,226-179,276-179,241-179));</script><a href="mailto:support@onehub.com">support@onehub.com</a>.</p>

      <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      
      <p>Onehub discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those 
        of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in 
        order to process it on Onehub’s behalf or to provide services available at Onehub’s websites, and (ii) 
        that have agreed not to disclose it to others including a credit card processing company to bill you 
        for goods services and an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf.</p>
        
      <p>Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home 
        country; by using Onehub’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.</p>
        
      <p>Onehub will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information 
        to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, 
        Onehub discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when 
        required to do so by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, or when Onehub 
        believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of 
        Onehub, third parties or the public at large.</p>
        
      <p>In the event Onehub goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another 
        company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will 
        likely be among the assets transferred.  You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership 
        or control of your personal information.</p>

      <p>If you are a registered user of onehub.com and have supplied your email address, 
        Onehub may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just 
        keep you up to date with what’s going on with Onehub and our products. . If you wish to no longer receive 
        our newsletters you may follow the unsubscribe instructions contained in the email communications you 
        receive.</p>
        
      <p>We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep 
        this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of 
        our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to 
        your request or to help us support other users.</p>
        
      <p>Onehub takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration 
        or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. We follow 
        generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission 
        and once we receive it. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order 
        forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method 
        of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we 
        cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site,
