  We will not sell, share, trade or otherwise disclose personally  identifiable information with third parties for their own marketing purposes.  We may share personally identifiable information with third party service  providers, such as shipping companies or companies who send e-mail  communications on our behalf. These third parties are not authorized to retain,  share, store or use your personally identifiable information for any purpose  other than completion of the services for which they were hired<strong>.</strong><br>
  In addition, in the following circumstances we may share or  transfer personally identifiable information to unrelated third parties: (i) to  comply with a legal requirement, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal  process served on us; (ii) to investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or  identity theft; (iii) in connection with the sale, purchase, merger,  reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of our company; or (iv) when we  believe it is appropriate to do so to protect the rights, property, or safety  of our company or other persons.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>5.  Sharing, Selling and Trading Aggregate Information Collected Online With Third  Parties</strong> <br>
  We may sell, share or trade compiled aggregate information with  third parties. As stated earlier, no single person can be identified by such  aggregate information.</p>
