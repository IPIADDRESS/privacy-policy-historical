<div><br>
    <strong>Use of Information </strong> </div>
<p>When you register with  Onewed.com, you submit certain information to the Site.&nbsp; Your information, as well as your name, email  and photo, are displayed so that you can connect with people. We may  occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications  regarding new services offered by or through Onewed.com that we think you may  find valuable.&nbsp; Your information is used  by Onewed.com primarily to be presented to others permitted to view that  information. In some cases, other Site users (for example, members of your  wedding party) may be able to supplement your profile.<br>
  Profile information  you submit to Onewed.com will be available to users and visitors of Onewed.com.  Your Site user name and other information will be available to users and  visitors of the Site, and limited pieces of information may be made available  to third party search engines. This is primarily so your friends and family can  find your wedding pages.&nbsp; All content  posted in the site’s community areas is public, including user-created wedding  pages and content added to those pages. Our forms for checking the availability  of a vendor for a certain date, or to request a quote from a vendor, are forwarded  only to the selected vendor. Where you submit information to the Site, you  generally cannot remove such communications.<br>
  Onewed.com may send  you announcements from time to time. For instance, if someone sends you a  message, if someone posts on a forum in response to you, or if there is a  bridal show coming to your area, you may receive an email alerting you.<br>

Where  third parties assist with the processing of personal information, we take reasonable  steps to limit the use of that information.<br>
  We may be required to disclose user information in  response to legal requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or as required  by law or regulation, but we do not disclose information without a belief that such  a request meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account  or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to  protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity,  or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with  other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.<br>
  We may offer products or services jointly with other  companies. You will be able to tell when another company is involved, and we may  share customer information with that company in connection with your interest  in such products or services.<br>
