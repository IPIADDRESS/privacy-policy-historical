<p>Onewed.com is about sharing information with you, and with your friends, family, and people involved with your wedding, which may include actual or potential vendors.

Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host or co-host our computer servers, or to send out emails. Where third parties assist with the processing of personal information, we take reasonable steps to limit the use of that information.</p>

<p>We may be required to disclose user information in response to legal requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or as required by law or regulation, but we do not disclose information without a belief that such a request meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</p>

<p>We may offer products or services jointly with other companies. You will be able to tell when another company is involved, and we may share customer information with that company in connection with your interest in such products or services.</p>
