                    <h4>Use of Information</h4>
                    <p>When you sign up with OneWed.com, you submit certain information to the Site. Your information, as well as your name, email and photo, are displayed so that you can connect with people. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by or through OneWed.com that we think you may find valuable. Your information is used by OneWed.com primarily to be presented to others permitted to view that information. In some cases, other Site users (for example, members of your wedding party) may be able to supplement your profile.</p>

                    <p>Profile information you submit to OneWed.com will be available to users and visitors of OneWed.com. Your Site user name and other information will be available to users and visitors of the Site, and limited pieces of information may be made available to third party search engines. This is primarily so your friends and family can find your wedding pages. All content posted in the siteâ€™s community areas is public, including user-created wedding pages and content added to those pages. Our forms for checking the availability of a vendor for a certain date, or to request a quote from a vendor, are forwarded only to the selected vendor. Where you submit information to the Site, you generally cannot remove such communications.</p>

                    <p>OneWed.com may send you announcements from time to time including newsletters and information on new OneWed features. For instance, if someone sends you a message, if someone posts on a forum in response to you, or if there is a bridal show coming to your area, you may receive an email alerting you.
                        For purposes of connecting you to the vendors you need, the Company may disclose your information to our affiliated vendors of wedding-related goods and services or otherwise. We may also disclose general, non-identifying information about you to third parties for purposes such as aggregating usersâ€™ and visitorsâ€™ Site behavior and preferences, and personalizing advertisements and promotions that support OneWed.com.</p>

                    <h4>Sharing Information</h4>
                    <p>OneWed.com is about sharing information with you, and with your friends, family, and people involved with your wedding, which may include actual or potential vendors.

You may choose to remove yourself from these mailing lists by contacting support@onewed.com. We may provide information to service providers with which we partner to bring you services. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host or co-host our computer servers, or to send out emails. Where third parties assist with the processing of personal information, we take reasonable steps to limit the use of that information.</p>

                    <p>We may be required to disclose user information in response to legal requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or as required by law or regulation, but we do not disclose information without a belief that such a request meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</p>

                    <p>We may offer products or services jointly with other companies. You will be able to tell when another company is involved, and we may share customer information with that company in connection with your interest in such products or services.</p>

                    <p>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Company changes, your information may be transferred to the new owner. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
