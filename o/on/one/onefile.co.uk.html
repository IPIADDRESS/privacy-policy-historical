        Privacy and Cookie Policy</h1>
    <p>
        Citrus Lounge Limited ("we", "us" or "our" for short) are registered to collect
        and process personal data under the Data Protection Act 1998 (the "Act" for short).
        Citrus Lounge Limited are data controllers of your personal information for the
        purposes of the Act. If you want to know what personal information we hold about
        you, please write to us at dataprotection@citruslounge.co.uk.</p>
    <p>
        We respect and safeguard the privacy of the users of onefile.co.uk ("the website").
        This Privacy Policy outlines how we will do this, how we will collect and use your
        personal information (such as your name, your email address, telephone number or
        other contact details) and how you can limit our use of this. Please read this Privacy
        Policy carefully which should be read together with our <a href="terms.aspx">website
            terms and conditions</a>.</p>
    <h2>
        What information do we gather?</h2>
    <p>
        Information is gathered in two ways: (1) indirectly (for example, through our website's
        technology); and (2) directly (for example, when you provide information on various
        pages of the website such as the contact us enquiry form).</p>
    <p>
        One example of information we collect indirectly is through Internet access logs.
        When you access the website, your numeric internet address is automatically collected
        and is placed in our Internet access logs.</p>
    <p>
        We collect information directly from you in a number of ways, one of which is through
        the use of cookies. We use cookies to remember you when you visit this website to
        keep track of your browsing patterns and to build up a profile of how you and other
        users use the website. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web server
        to the web browser, which enable the web server to collect information from the
        browser. Find out more about the use of cookies on http://www.cookiecentral.com.</p>
    <p>
        Most browsers allow you to turn off cookies. If you want to know how to do this
        please look at the help menu on your browser. However, switching off cookies may
        restrict your use of the website and/or delay or affect the way in which the website
        operates.</p>
    <p>
        We also collect information when you voluntarily submit it to us. On our website,
        we provide you with the opportunity to register for various services, register for
        email newsletters, enter promotions and competitions, and participate in online
        surveys. When we collect your information in this way, we will notify you as to
        how this information will be used. We will also provide you with the opportunity
        to indicate your preferences as to the use of your information.</p>
    <h2>
        Use of your information</h2>
    <p>
        The password you provide when registering with the website is encrypted to ensure
        protection against unauthorised access to your personal information.</p>
    <p>
        We invest in high-quality security and do our utmost to protect user privacy. No
        data transmission over the Internet can be entirely secure, and therefore we cannot
        guarantee the security of your personal information and/or use of the website. Any
        information that you send is at your own risk and may be read by others. However
        once we have received your personal information we use strict procedures to protect
        the security of your personal information.</p>
    <p>
        Any personal information gathered by or supplied to us via the website will be used
        in accordance with this Privacy Policy, in accordance with your wishes as indicated
        to us and in accordance with the Act.</p>
    <p>
        We may use your personal information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>contact you by mail or telephone to let you know about any of our products, services
            or promotions (which, in some cases may be provided by third parties) which may
            be of interest to you unless you have asked us not to. Where we contact you about
            these items by email, text message, or similar electronic means we will only do
            this with your permission</li>
        <li>ensure materials on the website are presented in the most effective manner for you
            and your computer.</li>

        share your personal information with third parties without your consent except in
