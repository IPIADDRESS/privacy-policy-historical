<h1>Privacy, Security &amp; Disclosures</h1>

<p>We recognize our obligation to keep member information secure and confidential. This obligation is very important to us. Our commitment to protect your financial information will continue under the guidelines described below. We reserve the right to make changes to our privacy guidelines whenever warranted to further protect our member’s financial information. Comments on your privacy can be <a href="https://ssl8.onenevada.org/form/email-us.aspx">e-mailed</a> to us.</p>

<h2>Internet Browsers and Online IDs</h2>

<p>We have taken all appropriate measures to ensure that our website and home banking product is secure, and that our members’ account information remains private. Our members also play a role in protecting their credit union account information. Your online banking Account ID and Password should be provided only when your browser shows a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) session is taking place. Secure Socket Layers (SSL) encode (scramble) account information between computers, so that it is virtually impossible to be read by others. We recommend that our members use a current version of browser software so that they may benefit from the most up to date internet security available. After you finish any website session that included viewing or sending private information you should close your browser window.</p>

<h2>Computer “Cookies”</h2>

<p>A “cookie” is a small text file placed on your hard drive by a web server. “Cookies” are commonly used on websites and do not harm your computer system. We use cookies to provide a more interactive and helpful website and to customize the information you see. You can control how a cookie will be handled (accepted or rejected) on your computer by configuring your preferences or options in your browser software. We use cookies for administration purposes of our website. We never combine information collected through a cookie to e-mail you, or to gain confidential account information.</p>

<h2>Collecting and Using Member Information</h2>

<p>For our internal use, we collect the following information about you:</p>
<ul>
	  <li>Information we receive from you on applications and other forms, such as name, address, social security number, assets and income; and</li>
	  <li>Information about your transactions with us, such as account balances, payment history, parties to
	  transactions and credit card usage; and</li>
	  <li>Information we receive from consumer reporting agencies, such as credit worthiness and credit history.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any information we collect is used to service our member accounts and to help us learn more about the financial products or services they would be interested in. Collecting information from our website helps us provide better products and services. We do gather and analyze data regarding usage of our website, including domain name, number of page hits, pages visited, length of user session, time of day, day of week, etc., to evaluate and improve our website.</p>

<p>We restrict access to protected information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.  We also maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to protect your information.</p>

<p>If you choose to close your account(s) with us or if you become an inactive member, we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this statement.</p>

<h2>Website Calculating and/or Planning Tools</h2>

<p>To help our members with financial decisions, various planning or calculating tools are provided on our website. Example of this would be our “How Much House Can I Afford” calculator.  We do not capture the personal information you provide on these planning tools.</p>

<h2>Links from Our Website</h2>

<p>We cannot control the content of other Internet sites. Links from our website are intended to serve as a benefit to our members and are offered on an as is basis. We are not responsible for accuracy, security or content of site links. We encourage our members to view privacy and security disclosures on all websites they visit.</p>

<h2>E-mail Address Collection</h2>

<p>In order to serve you better we may ask that you provide us with an e-mail address.  E-mail address information is necessary to manage our account database.  We assure you that the e-mail address you submit won’t be sold or shared with any other party outside the credit union unless we are compelled to do so by law. On occasion we may contact you at the e-mail address you’ve provided, if we have product or service information to share that may be of potential benefit.</p>

<h2>Sending and Receiving E-mail Messages</h2>

<p>When you e-mail us, we safeguard the content of your e-mail, your e-mail address and our response to you, so that we can more efficiently handle any follow-up questions you may have. We also do this to meet any legal and/or regulatory requirements. E-mail is outside our Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and therefore we recommend our members do not send confidential information via e-mail. One Nevada’s e-mail response back to the sender will not include confidential account information.</p>

<h2>Sharing or Selling Account Information</h2>

<p>To assist us in offering you services, we may at times choose to share information with companies that work for us, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. These companies might, for example, assist us in how best to offer you certain products or services. If information is shared, these companies act on our behalf and are obligated to keep the information that we provide to them confidential.  We do not sell personal account information.</p>

<h2>Member Surveys</h2>

<p>Finding out what your needs are and checking on how we’re doing in fulfilling those needs, is very important to us. At times we will ask that you complete a mail-in or online survey. All surveys and the information you provide are optional. We use the information gathered to improve our products and services. Never do we sell or disclose survey information to companies not working for us.</p>

<h2>Online Applications</h2>

<p>All of our online applications are transmitted to us using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. When you use an online application to apply for a loan, information may be shared with a credit bureau before a loan decision can be made.</p>

<h2>Contacting Us  About Your Account</h2>

<p>Keeping your account information accurate and up to date is very important. We will make corrections to account information as quickly as possible. If you ever find that your account information is inaccurate or not current, please let us know.</p>

<p>We use various ways to offer services and products to our members. You can choose not to receive offers made by mail, telephone or e-mail, or for us to not share your account information. Whatever your prefer, we will respect your request.</p>

<p>Please let us know if you would like further information on how, what or why we collect and use account information.</p>

<p>To contact us you can use any of the following methods:</p>

<ul>
	  <li>Visit your <a href="../locations/">nearby branch</a></li>
	  <li>Call our <a href="../contact.aspx#Phone" class="pop-up phone">Member Service Contact Center</a></li>
	  <li>Send us an <a href="https://ssl8.onenevada.org/form/email-us.aspx">e-mail</a></li>
	  <li>Write to: One Nevada Credit Union, 2645 South Mojave Road, Las Vegas, Nevada 89121</li>
</ul>






<h2>Children’s Online Privacy</h2>

<p>This Children’s Online Privacy disclosure is provided in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (16 CFR Part 312). This disclosure is specifically directed to parents and guardians of minors under 13 years of age.
</p><p>We recognize our obligation to keep member information secure and confidential, especially for children under the age of 13. This obligation is very important to us. The guidelines below describe our continued commitment to protect the personal and financial information of our members and website users under age 13. We reserve the right to make changes to our privacy guidelines whenever warranted to further protect our young members’ personal and financial information.</p>

<h3>Internet Browsers and Online IDs</h3>
<p>We have taken all appropriate measures to ensure that our website and home banking product is secure and that our young members’ personal and account information remains private. Our young and adult members also play a role in protecting their credit union account information. Your (and their) online banking Account ID and Password should be provided only when your (or their) browser shows a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) session is taking place. Secure Socket Layers (SSL) encode (scramble) account information between computers, so that it is virtually impossible to be read by others. We recommend that all our members, young and adult, use a current version of browser software so that they may benefit from the most up to date Internet security available. After you or your child finish any website session that includes viewing or sending private information you (or they) should close the browser window.</p>

<h3>Computer “Cookies”</h3>
<p>A “cookie” is a small text file placed on your hard drive by a web server. “Cookies” are commonly used on websites and do not harm your computer system. We use cookies to provide a more interactive and helpful website, and to customize the information you see. You can control how a cookie will be handled (accepted or rejected) on your computer by configuring your preferences or options in your browser software. We use cookies for administration purposes of our website. We never combine information collected through a cookie to e-mail you or to gain confidential account information.</p>

<h3>Collecting and Using Young-Member Information</h3>
<p>For our internal use, we collect the following information about children under 13 as we do for adults:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Information we receive from you or the child on applications and other forms, such as name, address, social security number, assets and income; and</li>
	<li>Information about the child’s transactions with us, such as account balances, deposits and withdrawals, parties to transactions and credit card usage; and </li>
	<li>Information we receive from consumer reporting agencies, such as credit worthiness and credit history (if applicable).</li> 
</ul>
<p>Any information we collect is used to service our member accounts and to help us learn more about the financial products or services they would be interested in. Collecting information from our website helps us provide better products and services. We do gather and analyze data regarding usage of our website, including domain name, number of page hits, pages visited, length of user session, time of day, day of week, etc., to evaluate and improve our website. 
</p><p>As provided by law, we are prohibited from collecting more information than is reasonably necessary for the purposes stated in this Children’s Online Privacy Policy. In addition, you as the child’s parent or guardian can review the child’s information we have collected, have us delete it and/or refuse to permit further collection or use of the child’s information. To do so, contact us by any of the methods shown at the end of this Children’s Online Privacy Policy. Please understand that if you have us delete all information on your child, we will be unable to continue to maintain or service your child’s account and the account will have to be closed. 
</p><p>We restrict access to protected information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to the minor. We also maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to protect the child’s information. 
</p><p>If the child chooses to close their account(s) with us or becomes an inactive member, we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this statement.

</p><h3>Website Calculating and/or Planning Tools</h3>
<p>To help our members with financial decisions, various planning or calculating tools are provided on our website. Example of this would be our “How Much Home Can I Afford” calculator. We do not capture the personal information the child may provide on these planning tools.</p>

</p>
<h3>Links from Our Website</h3>
<p>We cannot control the content of other internet sites. Links from our website are intended to serve as a benefit to our members and are offered on an as is basis. We are not responsible for accuracy, security or content of site links. We encourage our members to view privacy and security disclosures on all websites they visit.</p>

<h3>E-mail Address Collection</h3>
<p>In order to serve the young member better we may ask her or him to provide us with an e-mail address. E-mail address information is necessary to manage our account database. We assure you that the e-mail address the child submits won’t be sold or shared with any other party outside the credit union unless we are compelled to do so by law. On occasion we may contact the child at the e-mail address they’ve provided, if we have product or service information to share that may be of potential benefit.</p>

<h3>Sending and Receiving E-mail Messages</h3>
<p>When the child e-mails us, we safeguard the content of the e-mail, e-mail address and our response, so that we can more efficiently handle any follow-up questions you may have. We also do this to meet any legal and/or regulatory requirements. E-mail is outside our Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and therefore we recommend our members do not send confidential information via e-mail. One Nevada’s e-mail response back to the sender will not include confidential account information.</p>

<h3>Sharing or Selling Account Information</h3>
<p>To assist us in offering services to members, we may at times choose to share information with companies that work for us, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. These companies might, for example, assist us in how best to offer members, including young members, certain products or services. If information is shared, these companies act on our behalf and are obligated to keep the information that we provide to them confidential. We do not sell personal account information.</p>

<h3>Member Surveys</h3>
<p>Finding out what our members’ needs are and checking on how we’re doing in fulfilling those needs, is very important to us. At times we will ask that the young member complete a mail-in or online survey. All surveys and the information the child might provide are optional. We use the information gathered to improve our products and services. Never do we sell or disclose survey information to companies not working for us.</p>

<h3>Online Applications</h3>
<p>All of our online applications are transmitted to us using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. When you and your child use an online application to apply for a loan, information may be shared with a credit bureau before a loan decision can be made.</p>

<h3>Contacting us About the Child’s Account</h3>
<p>Keeping account information accurate and up to date is very important. We will make corrections to account information as quickly as possible. If you ever find that information regarding the child’s account is inaccurate or not current, please let us know.</p>
<p>We use various ways to offer services and products to our members, including young members. The child can choose not to receive offers made by mail, telephone or e-mail, and you may choose for us to not share your child’s personal or account information. Whatever the preferences of you and/or your child, we will respect that request. You have the option to consent to the collection and use of your child’s personal information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you would like further information on how, what or why we collect and use information from minors under age 13.</p>
