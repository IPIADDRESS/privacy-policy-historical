<span id="m_lblPrivacyHeaderInfo" class="OLbl"></span>
<br>
<span id="m_lblPrivacyBody" class="OLbl"><p>This document was last updated April 14, 2005.</p>
<p>At Microsoft Â® we understand that purchasing services online involves a great 
deal of trust on your part. We take this trust very seriously and make it a 
priority to protect the confidentiality of the personally identifiable 
information ("PII") you provide to us. (PII includes information that can be 
linked to you as a specific individual, such as your name, address, phone 
number, or e-mail address.) Sometimes we need information to provide services 
that you request, and this Privacy Statement explains what information we 
will collect and how we will use it. By using this site, you consent to the 
information practices described in this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>Microsoft is a participant in the
<a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/SHPRINCIPLESFINAL.htm">Safe Harbor</a> 
Agreement between the United States and the European Union, and complies with 
the Safe Harbor principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce.</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement applies to the Microsoft Office <span lang="en-us">
Online</span> <span lang="en-us">W</span>eb site. It does 
not apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites, products or services.</p>
<h3>Information collected about you</h3>
<p><span lang="en-us">Microsoft </span>Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span> collects personally identifiable information ("PII") about you that 
you specifically and voluntarily provide. PII includes information that can 
identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, phone number, or 
e-mail address. On all Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span> pages that collect PII, we specifically 
describe what information is required in order to provide you with the product 
or service that you have requested.</p>
<p>Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span> collects PII when you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Post to one of the Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span> communities</li>
  <li>Submit a rating</li>
  <li>Use one of the Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span> self-paced interactive courses</li>
  <li>Sign up for the Office Marketplace</li>
  <li>Contact Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Post to one of the Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span> Communities</h3>
<p>Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span> provides online communities where you can get answers to your 
questions about Office or post answers to other users' questions. When you 
first post to an Office community, Office will ask you to provide a screen 
name and e-mail address. All community users can see anything you post, 
including your screen name and IP address. Office also records the communities that you 
belong to and a score based on the number of users that you have helped. You 
have the option of publishing your e-mail address and community membership 
information to others on the system, although you are not required to do so.</p>
<h3>Submit a Rating</h3>
<p>You have the opportunity to rate some content in Office <span lang="en-us">
2003</span>, such as posts to 
a community, online courses, or design templates provided by Office. When you 
rate content, Office will collect your rating as well as a uniquely 
identifying number used to match you with the rating that you have provided. 
Your rating will always be anonymous. The uniquely identifying number is used 
only to allow you to change your rating at a later time.</p>
<h3>Use one of the Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span> self-paced interactive courses</h3>
<p>While you are taking one of the Office<span lang="en-us"> 2003 </span> self-paced training courses, Office creates a file for you that keeps track of the lessons that you have completed. This allows Office to show you which lessons you have already completed. This information is not made available to other Office customers or to any third parties.</p>
<h3>Sign up for the Office Marketplace (US Only)</h3>
<p>If you own a business or a service, you have the option of signing up to 
place your business information in the Office Marketplace section of Office 
<span lang="en-us">2003</span>. 
The information that you enter will be exposed to other Office users. Office 
Marketplace collects only the information that you choose to give to us.</p>
<h3>Contacting Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span></h3>
<p>Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span> collects information such as your full name, e-mail address, and/or 
contact information whenever you submit a question or suggestion. This 
information is used only to track your question and contact you with a response 
if necessary.</p>
<h3>Computer Information</h3>
<p>Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span> collects certain technical information from your computer each time 
you request a page during a visit to Office. This information is collected 
from your computer's Web browser and may include your IP address, operating 
system, Web browser software (e.g. Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), 
screen resolution, and referrer Web site. Wireless users: Please check with your 
wireless company if you are using your cellular phone to access the Internet to 
understand whether PII may be used to identify you.</p>
<h3>Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span> and Microsoft <span lang="en-us">.Net
</span>Passport</h3>
<p>Microsoft Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span> uses the .NET Passport service to provide certain 
registration and sign-in services. In order to sign in to this site using<span lang="en-us">
</span>.NET 
Passport, you will be asked to type your e-mail address and a password. This 
same Passport sign-in allows you to access many other Passport participating 
sites and services. If you create a .NET Passport from Office, you are 
simultaneously registering with Office and opening a .NET Passport account. 
All of the registration information that you provide will be stored by Office, and some or all of that information will also be stored by .NET Passport in 
your Passport profile.</p>
<p>To learn more about the Passport service and how Passport uses and protects 
your personal information, please read the 
<a href="http://www.passport.net/Consumer/PrivacyPolicy.asp">Passport Privacy Statement</a>.</p>
<h3>Cookies and Other Web Technologies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page 
server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your 
computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and cookies set by Office can 
only be read by Office.</p>
<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to 
save you time. For example, one of the cookies described below saves your 
language preference, so that Office will always provide you with the language 
you've selected when you return.</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers 
automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to 
decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you will not be 
able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other web sites 
that you visit.</p>
<p>Office will serve you cookies to personalize your site experience, 
authenticate your identity to the site, and store your language and site 
settings.</p>
<h3>Use of Your Information</h3>
<p>Microsoft Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span> will use your information for one of four purposes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>To store your information for you and deliver it to you when you request it.</li>
<li>To help you quickly find software, services or information on the Microsoft 
Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span> Web services.</li>
<li>To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you.</li>
<li>To learn about how our products fail and fix such problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>You have the option of receiving alerts of product upgrades, special offers, 
updated information, and other new services from Microsoft. You can choose to 
sign up for or remove yourself from these alerts at any time. Please see the 
section on <a href="#Deciding What Communications You Receive">Deciding What Communications You Receive</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information collected on this site may be stored and 
processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its 
affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, 
you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>
<h3>Sharing Your Information</h3>
<p>Microsoft Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span> does not sell or rent your personal information (PII) to 
anyone.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement, personal information you 
provide on this site will not be shared outside of Microsoft and its controlled 
subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission. We occasionally hire other 
companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including answering 
customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and 
processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the 
information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using 
that information for any other purpose.</p>
<h3>Our Legal Obligations</h3>
<p>Microsoft may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in 
the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the 
edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the site; 
(b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft and its family of Web 
sites, or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of 
users of Microsoft, its Web sites, or the public.</p>
<h3>Other Web Sites</h3>
<p>There are several places throughout Office that may link you to other Web 
sites that do not operate under Office<span lang="en-us"> 2003</span>'s information privacy practices. We 
encourage you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link 
to so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use, and share 
information. Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy statements or other 
content on Web sites outside of the Microsoft.com domain.</p>
<h3>Use of Web Beacons</h3>
<p>Office <span lang="en-us">2003</span> Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - 
sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow Office to count users who have 
visited those pages. Office may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order 
to count how many messages have been opened and acted upon. Web beacons are not 
used to access your personal information on Office; they are a technique we 
use to compile aggregated statistics about Office Web site usage.</p>
<p>Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie 
number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the 
Web beacon resides.</p>
<h3>Office Update</h3>
<p>Office Update allows you to scan your computer for the Office updates you need, and then download and install the necessary updates.</p>

<p>When you choose to scan your computer, Office sends a catalog to your computer containing a list of the potential updates that you may need, as well as an ActiveX control to run the scan.  The ActiveX control compares the contents of your computer with the update list and shows you the updates that you should install. Office Update then allows you to download and install the updates using the site.</p>

<p>Office Update maintains a log of successful and failed update installations.  This log is anonymized and used to ensure the quality of the Office Update service.</p>

<p>Office Update does not maintain a record of the specific files on your machine and does not collect any personal information.</p>
<h3>Control Over and Access to Your Information</h3>
<p>When you give us personal information, Microsoft Office will not share 
that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the 
limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated 
above.</p>
<p>You can access the information that you provide to us by going to the page in 
which you entered your personal information. For instance, you can access your 
posts in the Communities by going to the Communities home page.</p>
<p>Please be aware that this Privacy Statement and the privacy choices you make 
on this site will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have 
provided to Microsoft in the context of other, separately operated, Microsoft 
products or services.</p>
<h3><a name="Deciding What Communications You Receive"></a>Deciding What Communications You Receive</h3>
<p>Microsoft Office may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical 
service issues related to a product or service you requested. You can stop 
receiving these e-mails and delete personal information about you by following 
the instructions included with each e-mail.</p>
<h3>Protecting Your Information</h3>
<p>We want you to feel confident about using Microsoft Office <span lang="en-us">
2003</span> to store and 
share your information. Office helps to protect the security of personal 
information and honors your choices for its intended use. Our goal is to protect 
your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or 
destruction. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help 
protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. 
For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers 
with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Statement</h3>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Statement. When we do, we will also 
revise the "last updated" date at the top of the Privacy Statement. For material 
changes to this Privacy Statement or how Microsoft Office <span lang="en-us">
2003</span> will use your PII, 
we will notify you either by placing a prominent notice on the home page of our 
Web site or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to 
periodically review this Privacy Statement to stay informed about how we are 
protecting the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the 
service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Statement and any updates.</p>
<p>If you have questions about our Privacy Statement, please
