      <strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong><br>

      Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard 

      technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") 

      and web server log files to collect information about how our Web site is 

      used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include 

      the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, 

      and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site.</span>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">How Do We Use the 

      Information That You Provide to Us?</span></strong><br>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Broadly speaking, we use 

      personal information for purposes of administering our business 

      activities, providing the products and services you requested, to process 

      your payment, , to monitor the use of the service, our marketing and 

      promotional efforts and improve our content and service offerings, and 

      customize our site's content, layout, services and for other lawful 

      purposes. These uses improve our site and better tailor it to meet your 

      needs. </span></p>

      <p style="text-align: left; color: black">

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Furthermore, such 

      information may be shared with others on an aggregate basis. Personally 

      identifiable information or business information will not be shared with 

      parties except as required by law. </span></p>

      <p style="text-align: left; color: black">

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Occasionally, we may 

      also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes 

      to our Website, new services, and special offers we think you will find 

      valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive 

      these offers by emailing us at the link provided on the newsletter. </span>

      <p style="text-align: left; color: black"><strong>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">What Are Cookies?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br>

      A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous 

      unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks 

      your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard 

      drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own 

      cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to 

      protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the 

      cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other 

      sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would 

      prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your 

      browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse 

      cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as 

      effectively when viewed by the users. </span><b>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">A cookie cannot retrieve 

      any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</span></b>

      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left; color: black"><strong>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">How Do We Use 

      Information We Collect from Cookies?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br>

      As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to 

      differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to 

      prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for security. 

      Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to 

      calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which 

      parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to 

      constantly improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do 

      not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not 

      intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to 

      us in your cookies.</span> </p>

      <p style="text-align: left; color: black"><strong>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">IP Addresses</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br>

      IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the 

      Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the 

      network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically 

      collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known 

      as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be 

      sent to you.</span> </p>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Sharing and Selling

      We <b>do not</b> share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that 

      uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal 

      details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process 

      transactions or provide services that you have requested.</span> </p>

      <p style="text-align: left; color: black"><strong>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">How Can You Access and 

      Correct Your Information?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br>

      You may request access to all your personally identifiable information 

      that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us at the 

      usual address. </span></p>

      Compelled Disclosure of Information?<br>

      </span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">We may 

      disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when 

      we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection 

      of our legal rights. We may also disclose account information when we have 

      reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to 

      identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be 

      violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and 

      the Public.</span> </p>
