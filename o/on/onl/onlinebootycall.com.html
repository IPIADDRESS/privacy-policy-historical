<p class="pageTitle">OnlineBootyCall.Com Privacy Policy</p>

<div class="fck">
    <p>This policy is effective as of March, 15, 2010.</p>
    <p>MOBEZE, INC. ("MOBEZE") has created this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") as part of our commitment to helping our users better understand what information we collect about them and what we may do with that information.</p>
    <p>This policy describes our information gathering and dissemination practices for the website ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM. By using or accessing ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy and you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>

    <h2>1. Policy Regarding Minors</h2>
    <p>ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM AND/OR MOBEZE does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18, or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 18, please do not attempt to register for ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 18 may provide any personal information to or on ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a minor under age 18, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a minor under 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@onlinebootycall.com">support@onlinebootycall.com</a></p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you visit ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM you provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us and website use information collected by us as you interact with our website.</p>
    <p>When you register with ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, your email address, your telephone number, your address, your gender, and any other personal or preference information that you provide to us.</p>
    <p>When you enter ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM, we collect your IP address, browser type, hardware profile and the address of the pages you request. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." These small files are needed for the ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM site to operate properly. If your browser is set to reject all cookies, the ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM website will not function properly.</p>
    <p>When you use ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM, you may set up your personal profile, send messages, and perform searches. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. We retain personal profile information indefinitely as long as you remain registered at ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM. We retain information related to messages for 30 days. We do not retain any personally identifying information related to user searches. When you update any information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.</p>
    <p>You post user content on ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM at your own risk. Although we attempt to limit access to ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM members, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

We will automatically send your friend a one-time email or instant message inviting him or her to become a member. ONLINEBOOTYCALL.COM stores this information to send this one-time invitation, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@onlinebootycall.com">support@onlinebootycall.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

    <h2>3. Use of Collected Information</h2>
