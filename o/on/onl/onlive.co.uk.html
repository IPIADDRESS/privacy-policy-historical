                                Last updated: 8 February 2013

                                I.  INTRODUCTION

                                OnLive EMEA S.à r.l and its group companies (collectively, "OnLive" or "we" or "us") are committed to protecting the privacy rights and personal information of our online visitors and users. We have adopted the OnLive Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain our policies and practices regarding how we collect, store, use, and protect the information you provide to us. By using the OnLive Game Service and Websites you consent to OnLive using your information in the manner and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. 

                                    Scope of this Privacy Policy

                                This Privacy Policy covers the information practices for the following websites and service: onlive.co.uk and any other OnLive-owned domain names that point to onlive.co.uk (collectively, the "OnLive Websites" or "Websites"); and the OnLive Game Service (the “OnLive Service” or “Service”), which includes OnLive Customer Service (“OnLive CS”). Other websites and services owned and/or operated by or for OnLive contain their own privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only applies to information submitted and collected online by, through, or via the OnLive Websites and Service. This Privacy Policy is available for review on the OnLive Websites. 

                                    ESRB Certification

                                <a href="http://www.esrb.org/confirm/onlive-confirmation.jsp" class="txt_or" target="new"><img src="http://www.onlive.co.uk/images/privacy_clicktoconfirm.png" border="0" style="float: right"></a>This Privacy Policy and the certification seal to the right confirm that OnLive is a valid licensee and participating member in the Entertainment Software Rating Board (“ESRB”) Privacy Online EU Seal Program. To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative. The ESRB has reviewed and certified that the OnLive Websites and Service meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of the ESRB certification program, we are subject to frequent audits of our Websites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by the ESRB.

                                       Contact Us

                                If you have any comments, questions or complaints about this Privacy Policy or our information collection practices, please contact us via email at privacy@onlive.com; or, by regular mail to OL2, Inc., 1091 N Shoreline Blvd, Suite 100, Mountain View, CA 94043, Attn: Privacy Policy Administrator. 

                                    For the purposes of European data protection legislation, the data controller is OnLive, EMEA S.à r.l, 124 Boulevard de la Petrusse, L-2330 Luxembourg.

                                OnLive will promptly respond to your privacy concerns and questions. However, if you believe that we have not responded to your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, please contact ESRB via email at privacy@esrb.org; or by regular mail at 317 Madison Ave., 22nd Floor, New York, NY 10017, Attn: Director, Privacy Online Program.

                                II. THE INFORMATION WE RECEIVE 

                                There are several categories of information that we receive from you when you use the OnLive Websites and Service: (A) information you provide to us; (B) information we collect from you and (C) information third parties collect from you.   

                                You may visit and browse the informational sections of the Websites without providing any personal information. When we ask for personal information on the Websites and Service to, for example, set up an OnLive Service Account (“Account”) or make a purchase, we will not require anyone to disclose more personal information than we believe is reasonably necessary to participate in such activities. Each of the categories of information we receive from you is discussed below: 

                                    A.  Information You Provide to Us  

                                Personal Information: When you sign up for OnLive’s Websites or Service, you may provide a variety of personal information including your first and last name, gender, email address, contact phone numbers, birth date, and mailing address. If you subscribe to the Service or make a purchase, you will provide credit card information, including credit card number, security code, expiration date, a shipping address (if necessary), and billing address. You may also provide additional personal information that you choose to include in an email that you send to us via the Websites, the Service, or through a resume you submit in connection with your interest in working for OnLive or one of its respective subsidiaries or affiliates. All of the above personal information, including any other material and non-public sensitive information tied to your personal information, is collectively referred to as “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy.

                                Non-Personal Demographic Information: If you choose to complete surveys or your Player Profile, you may provide certain demographic information about yourself such as information about your lifestyle, personal tastes, purchasing habits, city and state, province or territory, education, job, and income. 

                                B.  Information We Collect From You

                                In connection with our provision of the Websites and Service, we may collect the following non-personal information from you. The information identified in this section may be combined with Personal Information in order to assist OnLive with community management, customer support, and technical support.

                                Information About Your Computer and Connection to the Internet: We may collect information about your computer, hardware, device, software, platform, media, Internet IP address, connection information, geographic IP information, and details concerning your Internet service provider. This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. 

                                Cookies: Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on the hard drive or memory of your computer or Internet access device. These cookies enable us to personalize your experience on the Websites, maintain a persistent session, passively collect demographic information about your computer and monitor advertisements and other activities. For example, cookies can advise us whether you have visited one of the OnLive Websites previously, and/or may contain other information that will facilitate your next visit to one of the OnLive Websites. Cookies do not include or collect Personal Information but rather, they identify your computer, usually by its Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. An "IP address" is a temporally unique number that can be used to identify your computer whenever you log on to the Internet.  

                                Please remember that with most modern browsers you always can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer. The decision to disable cookies, however, may prevent you from being able to use certain portions of the OnLive Websites. To learn more about cookies and how to specify your preferences, please search for "cookie" in the "Help" portion of your browser.

                                Clear GIFs: Clear GIFs are small graphic images (in GIF or other image format) placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an e-mail message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (e.g., only 1-by-1 pixel) and either transparent or the same color as the background of the web page, document or e-mail message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect Personal Information about you. We may, however, use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We may correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.

                                Website &amp; Service Logs: OnLive may collect information in the form of Website and/or Service logs (collectively “Logs”). These Logs are files that record activity on the Websites and Service and gather statistics about users' activities, such as how many users have visited the Websites, how often, how many "hits" a particular webpage has received, sign-in and sign-off times for the Service, type and quality of the user’s Internet connection to the Service, identification of the user’s hardware and software running the Service, which features on the Service you used, and the frequency of use. The entries comprising the Logs contain IP addresses, user IDs, email addresses and identification of the Internet service provider that provides your connection to the Internet. Generally, we use the Logs to operate and improve the Websites and Service, to identify the popularity of certain features, to assist with internal marketing and demographic studies, to enable us to assess overall efficiency and activity on the Websites and Service, and to assess users' web-browsing and Service activities, preferences, and habits. We also use the Logs to monitor traffic on the Websites and Service, to troubleshoot technical problems, to support OnLive CS operations, for security reasons, and to foster the safety of the Websites and Service. 

                                Player Tags and Player Profiles: Player Tags are unique OnLive identifiers that can be seen on the OnLive Websites and Service. Player Profiles are personal summaries that may include the user’s Player Tag, presence on the Service, last log-on, use of content, gameplay statistics, and stated city, region or country location that can be seen on the OnLive Websites and Service. In some cases, Player Tags and Player Profiles from the OnLive Websites and Service may be made public by OnLive, our affiliates, subsidiaries, licensors, partners, or suppliers for the purposes of leaderboards, enhancing multiplayer gameplay, tournaments, and marketing and promotion efforts and in providing us with such information you consent to such disclosure. Because Player Tags and Player Profiles may be widely viewed we caution users to avoid using any personally identifiable information when creating Player Tags and Player Profiles. We do not consider Player Tags or Player Profiles to be Personal Information, as used in this Privacy Policy.

                                 Brag Clip® Videos: The Brag Clip video feature allows a user to make a video recording of a ten-second clip of a user’s gameplay. A user’s Player Tag/Profile may be visible in a Brag Clip video. Other people may view Brag Clip videos either through the Service or outside of the Service through services such as YouTube or Facebook, for example, or by means of recorded video media. A user may choose to limit Brag Clip videos to only OnLive users identified as Friends (described below). If at any time a user does not limit viewing of Brag Clip videos, OnLive may from that point forward use such videos both on the Service and externally for other purposes, including demonstrations, tournaments, marketing, promotional efforts, game refinement, engineering analysis or any other purpose. In some cases, use of certain game features or participation in certain promotions, tournaments and other activities will allow other people to view Brag Clip videos. Because Brag Clip videos may be widely viewed, OnLive cautions users to avoid revealing any personally identifiable information during gameplay. Brag Clip videos are by default viewable by all OnLive users. A user may set different tiers of viewing of this feature through the Service including, for example, disabling all viewing of such user’s Brag Clip videos. 

                                Spectating: Through the Spectating feature, OnLive makes available continuous live viewing of a user’s gameplay. A user’s Player Tag/Profile may be visible during Spectating. A user may choose to limit Spectating of such user’s gameplay to only Friends, or limit such viewing so that no one else on the Service can Spectate the user’s gameplay. Because live gameplay through the Spectating feature may be widely viewed, OnLive cautions users to avoid revealing any personally identifiable information during gameplay. The Spectating feature is defaulted to the setting that allows all users to be Spectated by all other users on the Service. A user may set different tiers of viewing of this feature through the Service including, for example, disabling all Spectating of his gameplay.

                                Communications Within the Service: OnLive may access and collect information about user email, instant messaging sessions, video, text chats, Friend requests, online group activity, and any other forms of communication within the Service and users expressly consent to OnLive monitoring, collecting, recording (in the case of Brag Clip videos) and accessing these forms of communication. Any user communications within the Service should not be considered private and such communications may be viewed and/or heard by others as part of gameplay, for example, as part of Voice Chat during game play and Spectating. OnLive is under no obligation to monitor user communications but may act on reports of misconduct or abuse of communications privileges. Because communications may be widely viewed and/or heard, OnLive cautions users to avoid revealing any personally identifiable information through communications. Additionally, OnLive may collect any communication between users and OnLive CS, including email and any information sent from the user to OnLive CS, such as screen captures, video or audio recordings or data. OnLive CS may use such information as part of its customer service operations including collecting statistics, maintaining quality control and generating trouble tickets, which may be shared with appropriate OnLive internal groups or OnLive partners to address the problem or issue. 

                                C.  Information Third Parties Collect From You

                                In some cases, access to third party content (e.g., games, other related game content, demos, trailers, videos, and graphics) requires connection to the third party content provider’s game server in addition to the OnLive Service. Such connections to a third party content provider’s server may be necessary in order to enable gameplay and/or access to certain content features. When this is necessary, the third party content provider will identify the nature of their data collection as well as the type of information collected in their terms of service, privacy policy, end user license agreement, and any other relevant disclosures. You may be required to accept a third party content provider’s terms of service, privacy policy, and end user license agreement (collectively, “Third Party Terms”) during the third party content purchasing process. You will have an opportunity to do this before you make the actual purchase. If you accept Third Party Terms, any information that is provided by you to the third party content provider or collected from you by the third party content provider will be subject to the applicable Third Party Terms. 

                                D.  Making Friends and Sharing Information With Friends
                                OnLive provides social networking features that allow OnLive users to become “Friends” with each other. The Friends social networking feature allows you to identify certain OnLive users that you wish to distinguish from the general population of OnLive users. You may invite other users to become your Friends, and other users may invite you to become their Friend. Accepting a Friend request is voluntary, and you and/or other users may terminate a Friend association at any time. When someone becomes your Friend, that person will have access to information about what games you are playing and have played as well as communications, a list of your Friends, your Player Profile, your Brag Clip videos, your last visit to the Service, date joined, total play time, play style, and motto. By making or accepting a Friend request, you are providing your consent to such information sharing. It is important to note that Friends of your Friends, and Friends of these Friends (up to 3 generations of Friends in total), will have access to such information as well. Please consider this carefully when making or accepting a Friend request. You may stop sharing information with a specific Friend (and therefore, their Friends) at any time by removing that Friend. See our FAQ on Privacy Settings.

                                       Where we store your information

                                The Personal Information that we collect from you may be transferred to and stored in the United States. It may also be processed by personnel in the US who work for us or for one of our suppliers. The processing of your Personal Information in the US will be undertaken in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the US EU Safe Harbor framework. By submitting your Personal Information, you agree to this transfer, storing, and/or processing.

                                In relation to Personal Information transferred to OnLive in the US, this is covered by OnLive’s self-certification under the US EU Safe Harbor framework.

                                <span id="use">III.    HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</span>

                                If we wish to use your previously collected Personal Information for purposes that are materially different from when it was collected, we will provide you with notice of these new purposes and offer you a means to consent to such use before using the information for the new purpose. See the “Changes to This Privacy Policy” section herein for more information on how we provide notice and choice if our privacy practices change. This Privacy Policy places no limitations on OnLive’s use or sharing of anonymised or aggregated information.

                                When you provide us with your Personal Information, we and/or authorized third parties may use such information for a number of purposes identified below.

                                IV. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION 

                                OnLive may share your Personal Information with an unaffiliated third party under the following circumstances:

                                A.  Fulfillment of OnLive’s Services

                                We may retain other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include, but are not limited to, companies that help to administer the OnLive Websites and Service, companies that provide payments and billing services, companies that conduct surveys or assist OnLive in its promotional activities such as sending emails to you, shipping companies that deliver products, third party advertisers or promotional partners who provide a product or service to you, customer support specialists, web hosting and internet service providers, and data analysis firms. Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in the United States by our third party service providers. Any such third parties who are involved in the operations of the OnLive Websites and Service are authorized to use the information that is collected by and/or disclosed to them only for purposes of fulfilling their contractual obligations to us and/or fulfilling any obligations owed to you and to the other individuals who access and use the OnLive Websites and Service. OnLive requires that any such third parties protect the confidentiality of Personal Information they collect or have access to in the course of their engagement by OnLive.

                                    B.  Compliance with Law and Fraud Protection

                                OnLive expressly reserves the right to disclose Personal Information and any other information to third parties if we believe, in good faith, that we are required to do so by applicable law (including, but not limited to, disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of claims of fraud, misappropriation or infringement of any intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights, or any other conduct or activity that is illegal or that may subject you or OnLive, its agents, employees, affiliates or others to any potential legal liability or as otherwise required by law), or in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Service, or to protect the rights of OnLive, our users or others. We may also disclose Personal Information and any other information where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or as otherwise permitted by law. OnLive reserves the right to disclose to a third party the Personal Information or any other information of a user who we believe is in violation of any policy or rule as posted on the Websites and Service, even without a subpoena, warrant, court order or other governmental request.  

                                    C.  Sale or Transfer of Information

                                In the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, dissolution, or transfer of substantially all of the assets of OnLive, the Websites, and/or the Service, the Personal Information and/or other information collected about you from the Websites, and/or the Service may be sold, traded, assigned or transferred to the party acquiring all or substantially all of the equity and/or assets of OnLive, the Websites, and/or the Service in order to permit the party to continue the operation of any acquired assets. You consent to the sale and transfer of your information as described in this paragraph. If the successor entity intends to use your information for a purpose unrelated to that which it was originally collected, OnLive will contractually require the successor entity to provide you with notice of these new purposes and an opportunity to consent to such new purpose.  

                                D.  Customer Analytics

                                OnLive may share with selected third parties Personal Information relating to your registration to and use of the OnLive Service including, but not limited to, the date of registration, the use of any offers or promotional codes, purchases made from your OnLive Account, time spent on the Site and data usage related to your Account.

                                    E.  Direct Marketing

                                OnLive may share Personal Information with select third parties for the purpose of direct marketing.

                                V.  YOUR RIGHT TO CHOOSE HOW YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SHARED 

                                If you do not want your Personal Information to be collected by or shared with a third party as described in this Privacy Policy, do not provide your Personal Information to OnLive and/or the third party. Similarly, if you do not want your Personal Information to be collected by or shared with a third party that is involved with any particular event on the Service including but not limited to a contest or promotion on the Service (“Event”), you can always choose not to participate in such Event. To opt-out of further communications from a third party with whom you have shared your Personal Information, please contact that third party directly. We may also send you emails that may contain information regarding third-party products or services; however, this doesn't mean that we've provided your Personal Information to any party. You always have the opportunity to tell us that you do not wish to receive such correspondence. See the “Communications Preferences” section of this Privacy Policy. 

                                The Service also allows you to share certain information about your gameplay (based on your Player Tag) with everyone using the OnLive Service, with Friends (as described in this Policy), or with no one. The most effective way to limit any optional information sharing with other OnLive users, or with Facebook users, is to disable the sharing functionality and/or social features of the Service. Without sharing, however, you may not enjoy the full benefits of the Service because it will deprive you of the opportunity to meet other OnLive users and to chat and play games with them. Where you have an opportunity to limit sharing through the use of the settings and you do not do so, you agree that you will be deemed to have shared the information with third parties voluntarily and it will not be considered to have been shared by OnLive. 

                                You also control the sharing of certain OnLive information on Facebook by connecting your OnLive account with your Facebook account. In doing so, you may be connecting your Player Tag with personally identifiable information such that other Facebook users will know who you are. If you do not want your Player Tag to be associated with your personal information to third parties, do not use the “Connect With Facebook” feature. 

                                VI. ACCESSING, CHANGING OR DELETING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

                                OnLive allows you to access, change, or delete inaccuracies to your Personal Information in your OnLive Account. You can request this information by emailing or writing to us at the contact information set forth in the “Contact Us” section above.  We may require proof of your identity and will provide the Personal Information for a nominal processing fee. We reserve the right to refuse to provide you with a copy of your Personal Information. If we do not hear otherwise from you, we will assume the information you have provided is accurate and up-to-date and that you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of the Personal Information you have provided to us consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

                                Suspending Your Account

                                You may suspend (i.e. temporarily deactivate) your Account at any time, for any or no reason, for up to twelve (12) months by contacting OnLive CS from the Support section of the OnLive website. Also, OnLive may suspend an Account, or resume a suspended Account, under certain conditions specified in the Terms of Service for the OnLive Game Service (“Terms of Service”), including, for example, the expiration or renewal of your Service membership term. OnLive may suspend your Account if it is inactive (i.e. you have not successfully logged in to the Service using your Account, or you have not made any transactions associated with your Account) for twelve (12) months. You or OnLive may resume (i.e. reactivate) a suspended Account, if the Account is in good standing and any outstanding concerns have been addressed, at any time during the suspension.

                                Suspending your Account will temporarily disable your access to the Service using the suspended Account, and temporarily disable your access to all content or services on the Service that the Account would otherwise have access to, if any, whether purchased or not. Resuming your Account will restore your access to the suspended Account, and restore your access to content and services that are still available to you after the time that has elapsed during the suspension period or provide access to content and services that became available to you during the suspension. During this time, OnLive will retain all of your information, including your Personal Information, just as if the Account is in active use so as to enable OnLive to (a) keep track of any content or service expirations or activations during the suspension period, and (b) reactivate your Account if it is resumed during that twelve (12) month period. During the suspension period you, or OnLive under certain conditions specified in the Terms of Service, may close your Account, per the terms described below in Closing Your Account. OnLive will close your Account if it not resumed within twelve (12) months of the last suspension. If you decide to suspend your Account, please contact OnLive Customer Service from the Support section of the OnLive website.

                                Closing Your Account

                                CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT WILL RESULT IN PERMANENT LOSS OF ACCESS, CONTENT, SERVICES AND VALUE ON THE ONLIVE SERVICE. ONLIVE URGES YOU TO CONSIDER SUSPENDING YOUR ACCOUNT, PER THE “SUSPENDING YOUR ACCOUNT” SECTION ABOVE. RATHER THAN CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT, PLEASE READ THIS “CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT” SECTION CAREFULLY BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH CLOSURE.

                                You may close your Account at any time, however, OnLive may close an Account if the Account is suspended and not resumed within the twelve (12) month maximum suspension period, as detailed in Suspending Your Account, above, or under certain conditions specified in the Terms of Service. Closing your Account will immediately and permanently terminate your access to the Service using the closed Account; immediately and permanently terminate your access to all content, messages, services on the Service that the closed Account would otherwise have access to or could derive value from; and result in your immediate and permanent forfeiture of any coupons, access passes, credits, or anything that may be of value directly or indirectly associated with the Account, if any, whether purchased or not. Any remaining payments due on the Account will remain due and collectable after the Account is closed until they are repaid. If you decide to close your Account, please contact OnLive Customer Service from the Support section of the OnLive website. Within six (6) months after closing your Account or after any payments due on the Account are paid, whichever is later, we will either delete or securely encrypt your Personal Information except your email address, which we will keep in order to determine whether to send further marketing-related emails. We will also keep all financial and transactional records that are required for accounting, revenue-reporting and tax-reporting purposes. Your non-Personal Information, such as your Player Tag and password, will not be deleted. We will also keep information about your use of the Services or Websites including, but not limited to, data about your gameplay, session times and durations, and use of the Service, though we will disassociate such information from your Personal Information. Please note that even after you remove information from your Account or delete your Account entirely, information that was shared with other users may continue to exist on the Service.

                                If you engage in any repeated or objectionable misconduct, to be determined within OnLive’s sole discretion, OnLive reserves the right to either suspend or close your Account, in OnLive’s sole discretion, immediately and without notice as set forth in the “Suspending Your Account” and “Closing Your Account” sections herein. Refer to the OnLive Community Guidelines for examples of objectionable conduct.

                                VII.    CREDIT CARD INFORMATION

                                When you make a purchase through the OnLive Websites or Service, we collect your credit card information. However, OnLive does not store, maintain, or process that information. Rather, OnLive uses trusted third party vendors to process and store your credit card information. These vendors are required to comply with applicable data security regulations including Payment Card Industry Standards which require the safe, secure and confidential processing and storage of credit card information. 

                                VIII.   COMMUNICATIONS PREFERENCES

                                If you do not want OnLive to send you communications such as newsletters, announcements, or promotional offers, you may opt-out from receiving these communications at the time your Personal Information is originally collected through the communications preferences in your Account management page. Or, if you'd like to opt-out at a later date, opt-out instructions as well as instructions to update communications preferences will be included in the bottom portion of each email we send to you. You may also contact us by regular mail at the address listed in the “Contact Us” section herein. Please note that you may not opt-out from certain transactional or relationship messages (e.g., billing matters, Account reminders, legal updates) concerning your Account or products or services that you purchase from OnLive or that you use on the Service. 

                                IX. THIRD PARTY LINKS 

                                The Websites may contain links to third-party websites. Please be aware that OnLive cannot control and is not responsible for the information collection practices of such websites, which may differ from those of OnLive. We encourage you to review and understand the privacy policies of these websites before providing any information to them.

                                X.  DATA SECURITY

                                We maintain a variety of commercially reasonable safeguards designed to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access and disclosure, loss, misuse, alteration and destruction. For example, we use industry accepted tools and techniques to protect against unauthorized access to our systems, servers, Websites, and Service. Personal Information is stored behind firewalls, in password protected environments, and on servers in physically secure and access-controlled locations. Only authorized personnel may access this data. Sensitive financial information, like credit card data, is transmitted via industry standard encryption technologies. OnLive also regularly monitors its physical and information security for unauthorized access and attempts to access. In addition to these data security measures, OnLive maintains written security policies and provides ongoing training seminars regarding data security and the handling of Personal Information.  

                                You should be aware, however, that OnLive has no control over the security of other websites or services on the Internet that you might visit even when a link may appear to direct you to websites and services from OnLive. If you share your computer or use a computer that is accessed by the general public, remember to sign off and close your browser window when you have finished your session. This will help to ensure that others cannot access your Personal Information.

                                We want you to feel confident using the Websites and Service. No system, however, can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take commercially reasonable steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information, other communications or content always will remain secure. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your Personal Information, we will notify you if reasonably possible and as reasonably necessary so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address we have on record for you. You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your Personal Information. 

                                XI. DATA RETENTION POLICY

                                OnLive retains Personal Information for the period of your membership to the Service subject to the Suspending Your Account and Closing Your Account sections above.

                                XII.    MINORS AND CHILDREN

                                 Only persons who are at least 18 years of age are permitted to register for an Account as set forth in the Terms of Service, Section 3 (Eligibility). If OnLive becomes aware that any person under the age of 18 is submitting or has submitted Personal Information to the Websites or the Service without parental consent, we will close the Account and delete any Personal Information within our control as soon as possible. 


                                XIII.   PARENTAL CONTROLS

                                While users under the age of 18 are not themselves permitted to register for an Account, an Account Holder may set up Parental Controls to enable Minors (youth between 13 and up to 18) to access the OnLive Service through the Account Holder’s Account(s). Parental Controls allow the Account Holder to control access to content, community, and social features. If Account Holders choose to allow Minors to access the Service using Parental Controls, they should be aware that unless they restrict a Minor’s ability to communicate through the community and social features of the Service, Minors will be able to disclose publicly their personally identifiable information by messaging their Friends within the Service, voice chatting with anyone in the Service (including users who are not “Friends”), sending messages to Friends through alerts, and allowing other users on the Service to view your Player Profile. For more information about how to set up Parental Controls visit [insert link to the Parental Controls FAQ].

                                XIV.    CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

                                We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the updated date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, including using previously collected Personal Information for a new purpose, we will notify users by either sending an e-mail to the e-mail address provided to us by the user, or by prominently posting notice of the changes on the Websites and/or Service. We will give you an opportunity to opt-out of any materially changed Privacy Policy or alternatively, adjust your information-sharing preferences. We recommend that you check the Privacy Policy available on the Websites and Service from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy.</div>                    </div>
