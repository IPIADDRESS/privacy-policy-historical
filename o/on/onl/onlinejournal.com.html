<li>
                                    <strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</strong><p></p>
<p>                                    Personal Information. We collect personally identifiable information, such as names, mailing addresses, e-mail addresses, demographic information, and similar information in a variety of situations, including but not limited to the following: (i) when you subscribe to one of our newsletters or place an order; (ii) when you register at one of our web sites; and (iii) when you enter personal information on one of our web sites as a condition of participating in contests, promotions, or sweepstakes offered via these web sites.</p>
<p>                                    Some of our sites may collect credit card and related financial information if you wish to purchase a product or service offered via these sites.  If you wish to place an order for products or services online, you must generally establish a credit card account with us or our vendors.</p>
<p>                                    As a service to our users, we feature message boards, chat rooms, and other public forums (each, a “Public Area”) where users with similar interests or medical conditions can share information and support one another, or where users can post questions for experts to answer. Any information that you reveal in a chat room, message board or online discussion is by design open to the public. You should think carefully before disclosing any Personal Information in any Public Area. What you post may be seen, disclosed to, or collected by third parties, and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes.</p>

Our web sites automatically collect certain information, such as your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times and referring website address.  This helps facilitate your online experience at our web sites.  See Sections IV and V of this Privacy Policy for more detail on cookies, web beacons, and other information collected automatically for research and marketing purposes by our web sites.</p>

                                    <strong>WHAT DO WE DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION?</strong><p></p>
<p>                                    We use the personal information you provide to allow you to make product purchases, to fulfill your requests, improve our products and services, to send you promotional offers related to Onlinejournal.com or our business partners, and to operate our business.  A user may, at any time, opt out of receiving promotional offers by mail or e-mail by following the opt-out procedures set forth in Section VII of this Privacy Policy.

                                    <strong>HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong><p></p>
<p>                                    We share your personal information only as described below.</p>
<p>                                    Sharing Within the Onlinejournal.com Corporate Family.

<p>                                    [Participating Vendors. Some of our sites offer opportunities to make purchases online from special participating vendors.  On sites with online purchase opportunities for products and merchandise, we will also give participating vendors the order information and authorization for the merchant bank.

Participating vendors may use that information to advise you directly of other products and offerings that they provide.]</p>

<p>                                    Public Postings.  You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information, personal or otherwise, online in any community area (whether through Onlinejournal.com’s web sites or any other service available online), that information can be collected and used by others.  Accordingly, you should use caution when sharing any personal information with others in any community area (whether through TA Media’s web sites or any other service available online).</p>
<p>                                    Required Disclosures of Information.

                                    <strong>HOW DO WE USE WEB BEACONS, WEB ANALYTICS, AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MARKETING TECHNOLOGIES?</strong><p></p>
<p>                                    A number of technologies exist to assess consumer behavior both on-line and off-line.  Onlinejournal.com employs a variety of these technologies, including web beacons (see below), web analytics techniques, and other behavior marketing technologies, to assess consumer behavior and to understand how we can better serve our customers.  Many of these technologies are provided to Onlinejournal.com via third party providers specializing in behavioral marketing and consumer behavior.  In the course of using these behavioral marketing technologies, we automatically collect non-personal information from you, including but not limited to the following types of information: Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login, e-mail address; computer and connection information such as browser type and related browser data; content viewed; and purchase history, which may be aggregated with other information for analytic purposes.</p>
<p>                                    Some of our web pages, promotional e-mail messages, and/or newsletters may contain electronic images known as web beacons, which are also called single-pixel gifs.  Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information, but they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about the usage of our web sites and to track the number of users who have opened and acted up our promotional e-mail messages.  Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.</p>

                                    <strong>WHAT ABOUT THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS?</strong><p></p>
<p>                                    Some of the banner ads displayed in our web sites are provided by third parties. These ads contain cookies and may also contain web beacons.  Unlike cookies and web beacons used by Onlinejournal.com in content it controls on its web sites, cookies or web beacons received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this information. We use third parties to serve some or all of the advertisements that are placed within our sites and they may use information (not including personally identifiable information) about your visits to our sites and other sites to assist in serving advertisements to you.  These companies may employ cookies, web beacons, and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness.  They may share anonymous information with their clients such as date/time of the banner ad shown, the specific ad shown, the IP address, etc. Dart is our primary third party ad server.  If you would like to know more about their information gathering practices and “opt-out” procedures, please see http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/opting_out.aspx.</p>
