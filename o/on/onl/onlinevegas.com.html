User Information includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, phone number, or e-mail address.

		<br><br>

			<li>gathered through the use of web server logs and cookies. A web server log is a file where web site activity is stored. A cookie is a small piece of information that a web site sends to a visitor's computer and which is then stored on the visitor's hard drive.

<br><span class="title">How We Use Your Information</span><br><br>
We use the Information you provide about yourself when registering and to provide you with information about other partner's similar products and promotions that may be of interest to you. Your Information may be shared with our employees, independent contractors, agents or other related entities and/or business partners acting on our behalf to fulfill an award or promotion; conduct surveys; collect payments or to provide a product or service you have requested. We do not share this information with non-partner companies except to the extent necessary to complete your transaction (such as with NetTeller, your bank, your Credit Card company) and, when we do share it, it is subject to their agreement to treat it as confidential business information and with the understanding that it may not be used for any purpose other than to perform their function. <br><br>
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive as well as to provide you with customer support, special promotions and offers.<br><br>
In the course of growing or restructuring our business, we may purchase the assets of another company or sell the assets of our company. During these transactions, information about customers is frequently considered a business asset that is the subject of such a purchase or sale. Also, in the unlikely event that OnlineVegas.com, or substantially all of its assets are either acquired or subject to liquidation in bankruptcy, Information may be transferred as well.<br><br>
OnlineVegas.com may contain hyperlinks to and from other Internet sites, including other partner sites. These sites may have different privacy practices from the ones described here. Since this Statement applies solely to this Site, please remember to read the privacy statements of the other sites you visit. <br><br>
We release Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce or apply our <a href="javascript:PopWin('/terms.php');">Terms and Conditions</a> and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety OnlineVegas.com, Site users or others. This includes exchanging Information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<br><br><br>

<br><span class="title">Requests for Additional Information</span><br><br>
OnlineVegas.com may from time to time, contact the user directly to acquire more information in order to validate an online transaction or to disburse promotional monies.<br><br>

<br><span class="title">Marketing Notifications</span><br><br>
As a registered user, you may receive e-mails from us about special promotions, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, newsletters about OnlineVegas.com and its marketing partners. We may also use your e-mail address or telephone number to contact you about changes to your account. To assess the effectiveness of these e-mails, we may attach a trackable URL (on an image within the email) that provides confirmation when you open an e-mail. This only occurs if your computer supports such technology. To protect your right not to provide us with this information, modern e-mail clients, such as Outlook 2003, only send this tracking information to us when you have enabled such a feature, as it is disabled by default, in your mail client tool options.<br><br>
You may also receive telephone calls about special promotions, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, on OnlineVegas.com and its marketing partners. E-mail or telephone marketing notifications containing offers for our marketing partners will be sent by OnlineVegas.com. <br><br>
You may also receive postal mail notifications from us about special promotions, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, about OnlineVegas.com and its marketing partners. Postal marketing notifications containing offers for our marketing partners will be sent by OnlineVegas.com directly.<br><br>

<br><span class="title">Data Security</span><br><br>
OnlineVegas.com works hard to ensure that our systems are secure and that they meet industry standards. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Information we collect online. All transactions pass through Secure Socket Layer 3.0 technology to ensure your data is protected. The security of personal information you may submit in connection with a promotion entry, survey response, online facilities and/or registration for any feature on the Site is of the utmost concern to us, and we strive to ensure its security through encryption on our systems. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk. We will continue to assess new technology to evaluate its ability to provide additional protection of your Information.<br><br>

<br><span class="title">Protecting Children from Online Gambling</span><br><br>
At OnlineVegas.com Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. OnlineVegas.com will not allow Children under the age of majority (minors) to participate in contests or open real money accounts. In the event of a registration where we receive notice afterwards that a member submitted an inaccurate birth date at registration and is actually under 21 years of age/Age of Majority, we will immediately close their account and delete their personal information.<br><br>

<br><span class="title">Sharing and Control Over Your Information</span><br><br>
OnlineVegas.com does not and shall not sell your User Information to anyone. Our parent management company may share your information between other sites that it manages, but will never provide your User Information to a third party for sale or rental. Within our gaming software, the user may update their personal information. <br><br>

<br><span class="title">Right to Change Internet Privacy Statement:</span><br><br>
OnlineVegas.com reserves the right to change this privacy statement at any time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting.<br><br>
