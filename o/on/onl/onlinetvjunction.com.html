<p><span class="mview">1. INTRODUCTION</span><br>
<br>
By using the Onlinetvjunction our website, the User consents to the collection,
use, and storage of User information by Onlinetvjunction in the manner
described in this Privacy Policy and elsewhere on the Onlinetvjunction sites.
This Privacy Policy applies only to information Onlinetvjunction and the
Services collects about the User and does not apply to information about the
User collected by Onlinetvjunction’s affiliated providers or third party
websites and offerings linked to or otherwise accessible from the Onlinetvjunction
website or the Services. The information collected or received by Onlinetvjunction’s
affiliated providers and/ or third parties is subject to their own privacy
policies. <br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy details important information regarding the use and
disclosure of User information collected on the Onlinetvjunction sites to
enable the User to make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using
the Onlinetvjunction sites and the Services. It is clarified that any video,
image, or other User Content posted at the direction of the User onto the Onlinetvjunction
site and the Services becomes published content and shall not be considered
personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="mview">2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</span><br>
<br>
The information gathered by Onlinetvjunction may either be information that the
User voluntarily supplies to Onlinetvjunction when the User registers or
initiates transactions with the Services and/ or information gathered on usage
patterns and preferences as the User navigates through Onlinetvjunction’s sites
and/ or uses the Services. An agent or affiliate of Onlinetvjunction may, at
times and on being so authorized, collect information on behalf of Onlinetvjunction.
Third party providers featured on or linked to by the Onlinetvjunction sites,
such as vendors of products and services offered through the sites, may be
gathering the same kinds of information.<br>
<br>
User provided Information. To make use of certain features on the Onlinetvjunction
sites and to use the Services and when choosing to participate in various
activities on the Onlinetvjunction sites such as uploading videos, posting
messages, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking advantage of promotions,
responding to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or other mailing lists,
the User may be required to register and/ or provide certain personally
identifiable information as part of the participation/ registration process. Onlinetvjunction
may also ask for information from Users who buy products or services or conduct
other transactions on its sites. <br>
<br>
Any personal information or video content that the User voluntarily discloses
online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes
publicly available and can be collected and used by others. The User’s account
name (not the email address) is displayed to other Users when any videos are
uploaded or messages are sent through the Services and other Users can contact
the User through messages and comments. Any videos that the User submits to the
Onlinetvjunction sites may be redistributed through the internet and other
media channels, and may be viewed by the general public. <br>
<br>
<strong>Cookies:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;To enable Onlinetvjunction to make its sites more responsive to the
needs of the Users, Onlinetvjunction may use a standard feature of browser
software called a "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random
number, a type of user ID that may reside on the User’s computer. The cookie
doesn't actually identify the User but identifies only the computer that is
used to access the site. Advertisers and other third parties that provide
products or services through the Onlinetvjunction site may also assign their
own cookies to the User’s browser and such process is beyond Onlinetvjunction’s
control. Onlinetvjunction may use both session cookies (which are temporary and
disappear after the User closes the browser) and persistent cookies (which
remain after the User closes the browser and which may be used by the User’s
browser on subsequent visits to the site). The User may reset the web browser
to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some
features of the Onlinetvjunction sites may not function properly if the ability
to accept cookies is disabled. <br>
<br>
<strong>Other Methods.</strong> </p>

<p>The Onlinetvjunction web pages may contain electronic.images (called
"single-pixel GIFs" or "web beacons") that allow Onlinetvjunction
and its affiliates to count users who have visited particular pages or to
access certain cookies. These tools and other technologies to may be used to
recognize which pages users visit, and which links they click on. These
features may also be included in email newsletters so that Onlinetvjunction may
learn which messages have been opened and acted upon. These tools may also
enable Onlinetvjunction to verify online purchases by the User from the Onlinetvjunction
sites or from third party sites that have agreed to share such information with
Onlinetvjunction. Browser Level Information and IP Addresses. The Onlinetvjunction
web servers automatically collect limited information about the User’s computer
configuration, including browser software, the operating system, the website
that referred the User, and the User’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address browser
language, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages
viewed, the order of those pages, and the amount of time spent on particular
pages, the date and time of the User’s request, and one or more cookies that
may uniquely identify the User’s browser. <br>
<br>
<strong>Third Party.</strong> </p>

<p>Onlinetvjunction may permit third-party ad servers or ad networks, to
display advertisements within the Onlinetvjunction sites. Such third-party ad
servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to the User’s your
browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Onlinetvjunction sites
and automatically receive the User’s IP address when this happens. The third
party may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web
Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to
personalize the advertising content the User sees. The User should consult the
respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for
more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of
certain practices. Onlinetvjunction’s privacy policy does not apply to, and Onlinetvjunction
cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.<br>
<br>
<span class="mview">3. STORAGE OF INFORMATION</span><br>
<br>
Any information provided by the User to Onlinetvjunction shall be stored and
held under generally accepted standards of technology and operational security
in order to protect the User’s personally identifiable information from loss,
misuse, alteration, or destruction. Only authorized personnel are permitted
access to the User information and these personnel are required to treat this
information as confidential. Despite these precautions, Onlinetvjunction cannot
guarantee that any and all unauthorized access to the User’s information will
be prevented. All classifieds, User Content, postings, etc. are stored in the Onlinetvjunction
database, even after "deletion," and may be archived elsewhere and
the web logs and other records are stored indefinitely. Search engines and
other sites not affiliated with Onlinetvjunction - including archive.org,
google.com, etc. – may archive or otherwise make available Onlinetvjunction
postings.<br>
<br>
<span class="mview">4. USAGE OF INFORMATION</span><br>
<br>
Onlinetvjunction uses IP address information for systems administration and
trouble shooting purposes. This information is also used to deliver web pages
to the User upon request; to tailor the site to the interests of the users and
to measure traffic within the Onlinetvjunction site. Any personally
identifiable information provided by the User is used to operate, maintain, and
provide the User with the features and functionality of the Onlinetvjunction
sites. Onlinetvjunction does not use the User’s email address or other
personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages
without the User’s consent except as part of a program or feature for which the
User may exercise an option to not receive such messages. Onlinetvjunction may,
however, use the User’s email address without further consent for non-marketing
or administrative purposes. Onlinetvjunction may use both personally
identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information to
improve the quality and design of the Services and to create new features,
promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing
User preferences and trends. Onlinetvjunction uses cookies, clear gifs, and log
file information to: remember information so that the User is not required to
re-enter it during subsequent visits; provide custom and personalized content
and information; monitor the effectiveness of marketing campaigns; monitor logs
such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and to track entries,
submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests of the User. <br>
<br>
<span class="mview">5. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</span><br>
<br>
<strong>Affiliates.</strong> Onlinetvjunction may share certain types of
information such as account information, diagnostic information, transaction
information, and usage information with subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or
other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on
its behalf. Onlinetvjunction requires such affiliates to process such
information in compliance with this Privacy Policy and shall undertake all
reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other
appropriate confidentiality and security measures. <br>
<br>
<strong>Third Parties</strong>. Onlinetvjunction does not share the User’s
personally identifiable information with third-party companies or organizations
for their commercial or marketing use without the User’s express consent except
as part of a specific program or feature for which the User has the ability to
opt-in or opt-out. Onlinetvjunction may share non-personally-identifiable
information with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the
usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions,
and/or functionality on the Onlinetvjunction sites and the Services. Onlinetvjunction
may use the information to present offers to the User on behalf of business
partners and advertisers. These business partners and advertisers may receive
aggregate data about groups of Onlinetvjunction but do not receive information
that personally identifies the User Transactions/Requests with Third Parties.<br>
<br>
The User may choose to use the Services to purchase goods/services from third
party providers. Onlinetvjunction may share necessary information with third
parties to fulfill a transaction the User has requested. Onlinetvjunction may
share information where the User has consented to the sharing of such
information, or except as described in this Privacy Policy. Legal Obligations/
Fraud. Onlinetvjunction may be required to may disclose such records as it
believes in good faith to be appropriate or necessary to protect its legitimate
business interests, safeguard others, or respond to legal process like
subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, or to establish or exercise
its legal rights or defend against legal claims. The information may also be
required to be disclosed in order to investigate, prevent, or take action
regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential
threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of TOU, or as
otherwise required or permitted by law. <br>
<br>
<strong>Statistical Information</strong>. </p>

<p>Much of the information Onlinetvjunction collects is in the form of
aggregated statistics, such as the traffic that visits various pages within the
Services, the habits and preferences of the audience, etc. Such aggregated
information does not include any personally identifiable information and Onlinetvjunction
may use such aggregated information and/ or disclose it to third parties as it
deems fit. <br>
<br>
<span class="mview">6. FINANCIAL INFORMATION</span><br>
<br>
Onlinetvjunction does not store credit card information and other financial
data. Credit card transactions are transmitted to a financial gateway, and Onlinetvjunction
endeavors to protect the security of the User’s payment information during
transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Onlinetvjunction
will not disclose to third parties the User’s your credit card information or
other financial data except to the extent necessary to complete the transaction
initiated by the User.<br>
<br>
For e-commerce transactions, Onlinetvjunction may transmit the User’s billing
information using encryption which scrambles the credit card number and
personal information. However, since no security system is impenetrable, Onlinetvjunction
cannot guarantee the security of its databases, nor can it guarantee that
information supplied by the User won't be intercepted while being transmitted
to us over the Internet.<br>
<br>
<span class="mview">7. SECURITY OF INFORMATION</span><br>
<br>
Onlinetvjunction has established safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access
to or misuse of User information, but cannot guarantee that such information
will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. To
protect the User’s privacy and security, Onlinetvjunction may use passwords to
help verify the User’s identity before granting access or making corrections to
any User information. <br>
<br>
Onlinetvjunction uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and
technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of User
information. Onlinetvjunction, however, ensure or warrant the security of any
information transmitted to Onlinetvjunction by the User and is transmitted at
the User’s own risk. Once Onlinetvjunction receives the transmission of
information, Onlinetvjunction makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
the security of its systems. However, Onlinetvjunction cannot a guarantee that
such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by
breach of any physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. <br>
<br>
If Onlinetvjunction becomes aware of a security systems breach, then Onlinetvjunction
may attempt to notify the User electronically so that the User can take
appropriate protective steps or may post a notice on the Onlinetvjunction
sites. Depending on where the User resides, the User may have a legal right to
receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written
notice of a security breach (or to withdraw consent from receiving electronic
notice) the User should notify Onlinetvjunction using the contact form. <br>
<br>
<span class="mview">8. USER CHOICES </span><br>
<br>
The User may decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Onlinetvjunction
sites, in which case Onlinetvjunction may not be able to provide certain
services. If the User opts to register with and provide information to Onlinetvjunction,
the User will have the opportunity to unsubscribe, review, update, or delete
the information provided at any time. If the User opts to remove registration
information completely, the User may not be able to continue using certain
services that require registration. To protect the User’s privacy and security,
Onlinetvjunction takes reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password)
to verify the User’s identity before granting profile access or making
corrections. The User is responsible for maintaining the secrecy of the unique
password and account information at all times. <br>
<br>
It is clarified that media files uploaded by Users to the Onlinetvjunction
sites and the Services cannot be removed and remain subject to the TOU. The
User may contact Onlinetvjunction with any questions or comments about this
Privacy Policy, personal information, User consent, or opt-in or opt-out
choices using the contact form.<br>
<br>
<span class="mview">9. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</span><br>
<br>
Onlinetvjunction’s websites are not intentionally designed for or directed at
