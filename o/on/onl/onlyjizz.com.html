regulations, or governmental, or legal requests for such information;
<br>
2.
To disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring
legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms &amp;
Conditions or other user policies;
<br>
3.

We take measures to protect the transmission of all sensitive end-user information.
We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems.
Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-
party 'hackers' from illegally obtaining this information. We take all reasonable

assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite our reasonable
security measures.
