              <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong> <br>
                  <br>
                This Privacy Policy tells you the types of information we collect when you use  our Sites or Services, how we use that information, and the instances in which  we share your information. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>SUMMARY OF KEY PRINCIPLES</strong> <br>
                <br>
                We thought it would be helpful to set out briefly the key ways in which we use  your information and how we seek to protect privacy. Of course, you should read  the terms of our full Privacy Policy.<br>
                - We typically collect two kinds of information about you:  (a) information that you provide that personally identifies you (e.g., full  name or phone number); and (b) information that does not personally identify  you (e.g., your IP address or type of browser);<br>
                - This information is transmitted to, held and processed  by us in the United States of America;<br>
                - We typically use this information to provide you with  our website and related services, to deliver targeted advertising based on your  preferences and our promotions to you, and to produce reports and data about  online shopping;<br>
                - We may disclose this information to authorized third  parties including our merchants, advertising and promotional partners and third  party service providers for these purposes;<br>
                - We work with and permit advertising networks to use  anonymous information about you for preference or targeted online advertising  (see section III below);<br>
                - You may at any time opt-out of certain activities as set  out below (see section VI);<br>
                - Our websites use "cookies". You can set your  browser not to accept cookies if you so wish although this may affect your use  of our websites;<br>
                - We encrypt any information you input using Secure  Sockets Layer (SSL) software and take reasonable security measures to safeguard  information;<br>
                - If you register with us, you have the ability to update  or correct the information you previously provided via the account section;<br>
                - If you have any questions or concerns about privacy at  Shopzilla, please contact us by clicking here;<br>
                - Our websites and our services are not designed or  intended for use by children under 13; and<br>
                - This Privacy Policy may change from time to time so  please check this policy regularly. Any material changes will be notified to  you by email as appropriate.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>I. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong> <br>
                <br>
                We collect two kinds of information related to you: (a) Personally Identifiable  Information ("PII"); and (b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information  ("Non-PII"). <br>
                <br>
                <strong>(a) Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> PII  includes any information that identifies you as person. We collect your PII  when you choose to register with us or when you choose to participate in an  interactive feature of our Sites such as a review, survey or promotion. You  may: (a) provide your name, mail/shipping address, email address, credit card  number and phone number when registering with our Sites or in connection with a  contest entry; (b) provide certain demographic information about you (e.g.,  age, gender, shopping interests and preferences, etc.) when participating in a  survey or poll; or (c) post a general comment and/or recommendation on our  Sites. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>(b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> Non-PII is any information that does not identify you as a person including PII  which has been rendered anonymous. We obtain non-PII either separately or  together with your PII as described above. We collect certain non-PII from you  when you access our Sites including IP addresses and information relating to  your browser, operating system, ISP, the third party website from which your  visit originated and how you use our Sites such as the web pages you visit, and  the duration of your visits. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>II. HOW WE USE &amp; SHARE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong> <br>
                <br>
                PII and Non-PII is used to provide, or improve, our Sites and Services to you  and to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries, better serve you and  understand your needs, or is used in other ways naturally associated with the  circumstances in which you provided the information. <br>
                <br>
                We may disclose PII and Non-PII to:<br>
                (1) our third party service providers who perform  functions on our behalf in connection with the operation of the Sites or  Services e.g., providers who host and manage data, process credit card orders,  deliver our merchandise, etc; <br>
                <br>
                (2) participating sponsors to a program or promotion you enter through our  Sites or Services; <br>
                <br>
                (3) our parent company, subsidiaries or other affiliated companies  ("affiliated companies") for operational, marketing and promotional  purposes; <br>
                <br>
                (4) co-promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other  relationships; <br>
                <br>
                (5) participating merchants where you consent at the time you submit PII to us  when using the interactive features of our Sites such as surveys and reviews  concerning our participating merchants; and <br>
                <br>
                (6) our other users where you choose to publicly post reviews, comments or  other information relating to products or services, communicate with other  users via public forums (e.g., forums, message boards, bulletin boards, etc.).<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition, we use non-PII to help analyze site traffic, understand customer  needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities (see  "Preference Based Advertising" below). We may use your non-PII by  itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from others to produce  research reports and other information and data about online shopping for  participating merchants and other customers, as well as media and other  interested parties. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>III. COOKIES AND PREFERENCE BASED ADVERTISING</strong> <br>
                <br>
                <strong>(a) Cookies and Web Beacons:</strong> We automatically  receive and store certain types of non-PII whenever you interact with us by  using "cookies" and analogous technology. "Cookies" are  small files that we place on your computer or your Web browser memory to enable  our systems to recognize your browser and to provide convenience and other  features to you. <strong>It is important to note that the cookies  that we use do not contain and are not tied to PII about you.</strong> <br>
                <br>
                You may be able to direct your internet browser not to allow cookies and you  can delete existing cookies from your computer. Please note, however, some  elements of our Sites will not function properly or be available to you. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>(b) Preference Based Advertising:</strong> We work with  third parties, including advertising companies and website analysis firms, who  use cookies to collect non-PII when you visit our Sites and third party sites  about your surfing activities. This non-PII, collected through cookies, is  typically used by these third party advertising networks to serve you with  advertisements while on third party sites tailored to meet your preferences and  likely interests. If you do not wish to participate in this activity, please  click here and follow the simple opt-out process. <br>
                <br>
                A couple of important notes about this opt-out tool: (1) it includes all the  advertising networks that Shopzilla works with, but also many that Shopzilla  does not work with; and (2) it relies on cookies to ensure that a given  advertising network does not collect information about you ("Opt-out  Cookies") - for a general explanation of how Opt-out Cookies work, please  click here . Therefore, if you buy a new computer, change web browsers or  delete these Opt-out Cookies from your computer, you will need to perform the  opt-out task again. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>IV. SALE OF BUSINESS AND DISCLOSURE BY LAW</strong> <br>
                <br>
                <strong>(a) Business Transactions:</strong> We may disclose PII  and Non-PII held by us: (a) to a prospective seller or actual seller of any  business or assets we acquire; (b) if all or any of our assets are acquired by  a third party, in which case, PII and Non-PII may be one of the transferred  assets. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>(b) Required disclosures:</strong> We may disclose and  use any PII or non-PII if we are required to do so by law, with respect to  copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims, or if we believe  that such action is necessary to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform  with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our  legal rights or property, our Sites, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to  protect the health and safety of our Sites's users or the general public. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>V. SECURITY OF INFORMATION</strong> <br>
                <br>
                We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by  using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you  input. We also use a secure server hosting location in the US, firewall  protection, controlled access and encryption technology to protect your data.  Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your PII, we cannot  guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit  to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent  disclosure of your PII. In the unfortunate event that your personally  identifiable information is compromised, we will notify you by e-mail to the  last e-mail address you have provided us as soon as feasible under the  circumstances (delays in notification may occur while we take necessary  measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity  to the system, as well as for the legitimate needs of law enforcement if  notification would impede a criminal investigation). <br>
                <br>
                <strong>VI. YOUR OPTIONS &amp; OPT-OUTS</strong> <br>
                <br>
                <strong>(a) What Information Can I Access?</strong> If you  register as a Shopzilla member, you will typically have access to an account  section that includes the registration information you previously provided  which you can update or correct at any time. If there is any inaccurate  information that you are not able to correct, just let us know. Also, if you  wish, you can delete your membership account entirely although we may retain  certain information in limited circumstances - e.g., to resolve disputes,  troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Use . Furthermore, some  information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical  (e.g., information that is stored in our "back-up" systems) and  certain legal constraints. <br>


                <br>
                <strong>VII. CHILDREN</strong> <br>
                <br>
                As our Sites nor our Services are not intended for use by children under 13,  Children under 13 may not submit any PII to us. Also, if you are under 18, you  should use Shopzilla and submit information only with involvement of a parent  or guardian. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>VIII. REVISIONS</strong> <br>
                <br>
                This Privacy Policy may change from time to time to reflect our changing  business practices. We will provide you notice of any such changes by posting  the new policy on our Sites or by email if the changes are material. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>VII. SOLE STATEMENT</strong> <br>
                <br>
                This Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use , both as posted on our Sites and  through our Services, contain all of the material terms of regarding your use  of our Websites and Services. No summary, modification, restatement or other  version thereof, or other privacy statement or policy, in any form, is valid  unless we post it to our Sites and Services. </p>
