        <strong>CONSUMER CHOICE AND ACCESS </strong><br><br>
      Should you no longer want to receive offers from a OnlineRewardsClub, you may choose  to "unsubscribe" through by using the unsubscribe option within any  promotional offer or through the website. In accordance with the CAN-SPAM Act,  you will be completely taken off of our email list and you will no longer  receive offers from us. If you have registered or submitted PII (Personally  Identifiable Information) under multiple email accounts, you must submit  separate unsubscribe requests for each account. <br><br>
      Cookies that we use do not have an "opt-out" option, yet by changing  the setting on your internet browser, you still have the option of blocking  cookies. Please see your browserâ€™s help function or internet options tab for  instructions. <br><br>
      OnlineRewardsClub uses software and third-party sources to validate the accuracy of  PII provided and/or filter suspicious data. You may change, correct or update  your information by email by contacting OnlineRewardsClub. Changing or deleting your  information or otherwise opting-out of receipt of communications from the  OnlineRewardsClub will change or delete the data only in our database for purposes  of transacting future business on our sites and for managing future  communications from OnlineRewardsClub. These changes and deletions will not change  or delete information already collected as part of a particular transaction.<br><br>

When you place an order with an OnlineRewardsClub site, you will  be asked to provide your name, address, zip code, email address and billing  information. This information is used to process your order and we cannot do so  without it. <br><br>
      The OnlineRewardsClub may use your PII for customer service, to provide you with  information that you may request, to customize your experience on the Site, and  to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into by  you on the Site. We also may use your personal information for internal  business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our business or combine the  information we have gathered about you with information from other sources.<br><br>
      Unless you tell us not to, we may use your personal information to contact you  about offers or promotions from OnlineRewardsClub and selected third parties we  think you would be interested in. <br><br>
  <br><br>
  <strong>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-Personally Identifiable  Information (PII). </strong><br><br>
      When you visit an OnlineRewardsClub site, we send a cookie and/or gif file  ("Cookies") to assign an anonymous, unique identifier to the end  user's Internet browser. Cookies are small data files commonly used on the  Internet to help optimize and personalize the Internet end user experience and  identify repeat visitors to websites. For example, Cookies enable OnlineRewardsClub  to track your shopping cart and retrieve your information and preferences when  you return to our site.<br><br>

  <br><br>
  <strong>INFORMATION SHARING </strong><br><br>
      OnlineRewardsClub may use third party vendors to help us operate our business and  OnlineRewardsClub sites or administer activities on our behalf. We may share your  information with these third parties for those limited purposes. Any  third-party vendor so used has agreed to protect the confidentiality of  information provided by OnlineRewardsClub. OnlineRewardsClub reserves the right to rent  or sell all email addresses and personal information submitted on our site. <br><br>
      OnlineRewardsClub and/or our marketing partners may enhance and/or merge PII about  consumers who have opted-in to receive marketing communications with  commercially-available third party data collected from other sources in an  effort to ensure that the messages being sent to the consumer in online and/or  offline marketing programs are relevant to their interests. In the event we  enhance and/or merge such personally identifiable information with data  collected from other sources, we will take reasonable steps to maintain the  integrity and quality of that information. <br><br>
      OnlineRewardsClub may share PII (including information that has been enhanced with  information from other sources) with advertisers, third party marketers, our  affiliated entities for their online and/or offline marketing programs or in  connection with the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of  substantial asset, reorganization or liquidation of any of the OnlineRewardsClub  companies. While OnlineRewardsClub strongly encourages clients and partners to adopt  responsible approaches to online marketing, OnlineRewardsClub is not responsible for  the information practices of clients or their partners. The collection, use,  and disclosure of information by clients and partners are subject to their  respective privacy policies, which may differ from this policy. <br><br>
      OnlineRewardsClub may release account and any other personal information when we  believe release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply  with the law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements;  or protect the rights, property, or safety of OnlineRewardsClub or others. This  includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for  fraud protection. <br><br>
  <br><br>
  <strong>CONSENT AND CHANGES </strong><br><br>
      OnlineRewardsClub may find it necessary or be legally obligated to update this  Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on  this page and update the effective date so that you are always aware of the  information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose  it. Except as otherwise required by law, modifications to this Privacy Policy  will not affect the privacy of data collected by OnlineRewardsClub prior to the  effective date of the policy change unless we provide you direct notice and the  opportunity to opt-out of such proposed change.<br><br>
  <strong>DATA PROCESSING </strong><br><br>
      You acknowledge that OnlineRewardsClub operates in the United State and agree to (i)  permit OnlineRewardsClub to transmit and use your User information anywhere  necessary, including across international boundaries, to affect the services  and transactions provided by this Site; and (ii) that such use OnlineRewardsClub  shall be subject to the terms and conditions stated in this Privacy Statement  and our Terms and Conditions.<br><br>
  <br><br>
  <strong>SECURITY </strong><br><br>
      OnlineRewardsClub employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security  of all data. Any data that is stored on OnlineRewardsClub servers is treated as  proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public. OnlineRewardsClub  also encrypts sensitive information such as passwords and financial data.  OnlineRewardsClub has an internal security policy with respect to the  confidentiality of customer and other data, allowing access only to those  employees or third parties who have a need to know such information for the  purpose of effectively delivering OnlineRewardsClub products and services by means  of user login and password requirements. The OnlineRewardsClub Network routinely  evaluates its data security practices to identify security threats or  opportunities for improvement.<br><br>
      No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely  secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of  OnlineRewardsClub to intercept or access transmissions or private communications  unlawfully. While we strive to protect your PII, OnlineRewardsClub cannot ensure or  warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You acknowledge and  assume this risk when communicating with a OnlineRewardsClub Network company.<br><br>
  <strong>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY AND SPAM </strong><br><br>
      OnlineRewardsClub is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and makes  every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet.  OnlineRewardsClub web sites, products, and services are not developed for or  directed at children. Our policy is not to permit anyone under the age of 13 to  do business with us. If you believe your child has provided OnlineRewardsClub with  any personally identifiable data by registering at a&nbsp; OnlineRewardsClub web  site, please contact <a href="mailto:ERG@customsupportsultions.com">OnlineRewardsClub</a> to have them removed. <br><br>
      OnlineRewardsClub is committed to proper Internet practices and full compliance with  the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. Â§ 7701). It is our policy to prohibit the  sending of unsolicited or "Spam" email by OnlineRewardsClub or any of its  marketing partners. <br><br>
      Please note that under the CAN-SPAM Act, an advertiser is required to provide  an opt-out mechanism for consumers to unsubscribe from future emails about the  advertiser. Although not required to by law, many email marketers also include  an opt-out mechanism to enable consumers to be removed from their mailing list.  This has caused some confusion for consumers in opting out. <br><br>
  <br><br>
  <strong>STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBLE ONLINE MARKETING</strong><br><br>
      OnlineRewardsClub information usage practices are based on two beliefs: first, that  protecting user privacy is essential to the growth and prosperity of the  Internet; second, that a personalized web experience can provide significant  benefits to Internet end users if done properly. In accordance with these  beliefs, OnlineRewardsClub creates opportunities for advertisers and consumers in  revolutionary ways without compromising individual privacy.<br><br>
  <br><br>
  <strong>CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS: YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong><br><br>
      As of January 1, 2005, companies that collect personally identifiable  information ("PII") from California residents and disclose such  information to third parties (including affiliated entities) for marketing  purposes must, in response to a request by a consumer, either (1) provide a list  detailing the categories of information shared and the entities to which such  information was provided or (2) provide a mechanism by which a consumer may  opt-out of having their information shared with third parties. We have elected  the second option and you may request that your PII not be shared with third  parties by sending your request, including your full name, email address and  postal address below.<br><br>
