                            This privacy policy <strong>(“Privacy Policy”)</strong> is designed to inform you
                            about the type of information that www.onlinecomcast.com <strong>("www.onlinecomcast.com", "we", "our" or "us")</strong>
                            may gather about or collect from you in connection with your use of this site (this
                            <strong>“Site”</strong>). It also is intended to explain the conditions under which
                            we use and disclose that information, and your rights in relation to that information.
                            <p>
                                The procedures for modifying or changing this Privacy Policy in the future are discussed
                                in Section 6.

                            This Site is not intended for children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly
                            collect personal information from children under 18. </li>
                        <li><strong>Gathering, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br>
                            We collect both Non-Personally-Identifying Information and Personally-Identifying
                            Information from you. “Non–Personally–Identifying Information” is information that,
                            without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a
                            specific person or entity. “Personally–Identifying Information,” by contrast, is
                            information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly
                            associated with a specific person or entity.</li>

                                <li><strong><em>Web Browsers</em></strong><br>
                                    Like most site operators, we gather from you Non-Personally-Identifying Information
                                    of the sort that web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available.
                                    That information includes your Internet Protocol<strong> (“IP”)</strong> address,
                                    operating system and browser type, and the locations of the web pages that you view
                                    right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving this Site.</li>
                                <li><strong><em>Web Cookies</em></strong><br>
                                    A <strong>“Web Cookie”</strong> is a string of information that a site stores on
                                    your computer, and that your browser provides to this Site each time you submit
                                    a query to this site. We use Web Cookies to track the pages that you visit during
                                    each Site session, both to help us improve your experiences with this Site to help
                                    us understand how this Site is being used.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR
                                    BROWSER TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THIS SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING
                                    THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THIS SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF
                                    WEB COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE WEB COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING
                                    LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY. </li>
                                <li><strong><em>Web Beacons</em></strong><br>
                                    A <strong>“Web Beacon”</strong> is an object that is embedded in a web page. It
                                    is usually invisible to you but allows site operators to check whether you have
                                    viewed a particular web page or email communication. We may occasionally place Web
                                    Beacons on pages of this Site.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they may be rendered ineffective by declining
                                    all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is
                                    tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.

                            <li><strong><em>Use of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</em></strong><br>
                            We analyze Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from you to help us better understand how this Site is being used.  By identifying patterns and trends in usage, we are able to better design this Site to improve your experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use.  We link information gathered using Web Cookies and Web Beacons to Personally-Identifying Information.</li>
                            <li><strong><em>Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</em></strong><br>
                            From time to time, we may also release the Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from you in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of this Site.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <li><strong><em>Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personally–Identifying Information</em></strong><br>
                        As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity.  We will only collect Personally-Identifying Information that you knowingly submit to us.  We will not disclose Personally-Identifying Information to third parties unless we obtain your permission to do so at the time we collect it, except as set forth below:</li>

                            <li><strong><em>Registration and Other Information Provided to Us</em></strong><br>
                            When you register with this Site, you may be asked to disclose Personally–Identifying Information.  You may also choose to submit Personally-Identifying Information to us when you send us an email. </li>
                            <li><strong><em>Surveys</em></strong><br>
                            From time to time, we may also ask you to participate in surveys designed to help us improve this Site.  Any Personally-Identifying Information provided to us in connection with a survey will be used only in relation to that survey, and will be disclosed to third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy only in non-personally-identifying, aggregated form.</li>
                            <li><strong><em>Other Disclosures</em></strong><br>
                            Notwithstanding any other provision in this Privacy Policy, we will disclose Personally-Identifying Information in the following limited circumstances:
                            </li>

                            <li><strong><em>Employees and Third Party Processors </em></strong><br>
                            We will disclose Personally–Identifying Information to our employees, contractors, affiliates, vendors and suppliers who process Personally–Identifying Information on our behalf or participate with us in the provision or operation of this Site.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong><em>By Law, to Protect Rights and to Comply with Our Policies </em></strong><br>
                            We disclose Personally–Identifying Information if:  (1) required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena or court order; (2) we believe in our sole discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect against fraud, to protect our property or other rights, or the rights of other users, third parties or the public at large; or (3) we believe that you have abused the service by using it to attack other systems or to gain unauthorized access to any other system, to engage in spamming or otherwise to violate applicable laws.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong><em>Business Transfers; Bankruptcy</em></strong><br>
                            We reserve the right to transfer all Personally-Identifying Information in our possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of our assets.  Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred Personally–Identifying Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are given notice of that new privacy policy and you affirmatively opt-in to accept it.  Personally-Identifying Information submitted or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor organization.  </li>
                            <li><strong><em>Marketing</em></strong><br>
                           We may contact you by email or telephone about products and services that we think may be of interest to you.  If you wish to opt out of receiving marketing emails from us, please follow the instructions at the bottom of each email.    </li>
                        </ol>
                            <li><strong><em>Security</em></strong><br>
                            We take reasonable precautions to protect the security of your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof.  Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your Personally-Identifying Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</li>
                            <li><strong><em>Contests, Giveaways and other Promotions</em></strong><br>
                            From time to time, we may offer Site users the opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways and other promotions.  Any information submitted in connection with promotions will be subject to the terms of the promotion, not this Privacy Policy.   You will be given the option to consent to the use of your Personally-Identifying Information at the time you sign up for the promotion.  You will not be required to participate in any promotion.
                            </li>
                       </ol>
                       <li><strong><em>Collection and Use of Information by Third Parties Not Covered By This Agreement</em></strong><br>
                       Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect to Personally-Identifying Information and Non-Personally-Identifying Information that you provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves.  We do not control third-party sites that may be accessible through this Site.  Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to third party sites or gathered by the third parties that operate them.  Before visiting a third party site, whether by means of a link on this Site or otherwise, and before providing any Personally-Identifying Information to any third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that site, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect their privacy.  </li>
                       <li><strong><em>Privacy Policy Changes</em></strong><br>
                       Because of changes in technology and the growth and development of our business or for other reasons, we may need to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time.   We will alert you by email if this policy is revised (if you have given us your email address) and will post a copy of the new policy with its effective date on this Site.  It is therefore important that you register with this Site and notify us if you change email addresses.  If you do not provide us with a current email address, you should regularly review this policy to ensure that you are informed of any changes.  
Unless we obtain your express consent, any revised Privacy Policy will apply only to information collected after the time it takes effect, and not to information collected under any earlier Privacy Policy.  
This policy is effective as of and was last updated on March 01, 2009.
