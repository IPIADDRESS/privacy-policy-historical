<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where the Company has given you (or where you
have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this
password confidential. The Company asks you not to share your password with anyone. The Company urges you to be
careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like message boards or public forums. The

other users see about you by adjusting your <a target="_blank" href="/forum/account/privacy">privacy
settings</a> in your <a target="_blank" href="/forum/account/privacy">account settings</a> page.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although the Company
does its best to protect your personal information, the Company cannot guarantee the security of your personal
information transmitted to the Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. The
Company is not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the

<p>This policy is intended to cover collection of information on or through the Website from residents of the United

the Company’s central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other
countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that the Company seeks to
take reasonable steps to make sure that your privacy is protected. By using the Company’s services, you

across websites or online services. The Company is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the
information it collects and that is why the Company provides you the ability to opt out. But the Company does
not recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT
means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. For more information, visit
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com">www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>
<p>10. <strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>

like to opt out from the disclosure of your personal information to any third party for direct marketing
purposes, please contact the Company at <a href="mailto:info@stelivo.com">info@stelivo.com</a>.

<p>The Company complies with Canadian Federal and Provincial privacy laws and regulations, including the Personal
Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.</p>

unless the Company has obtained your consent to use it for other purposes.</p>

databases outside of Canada, including in the United States, and may be subject to disclosure to authorized law
enforcement or government agencies in response to lawful demand under the laws of that country. </p>
<p>If you need to contact the Company about your personal information or believe that the Company has violated your
privacy rights, please contact the Company at <a href="mailto:info@stelivo.com">info@stelivo.com</a>. You may visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.priv.gc.ca">www.priv.gc.ca</a>

relating to Website users.</p>
