                    <b><u>Using Information to Help You</u></b><br>
                    To provide you with top service and safeguard your information online, we will 
                    need to collect or remember information about you from time to time. In order to 
                    complete a transaction, it is necessary to be a customer and to register on the 
                    site. During registration, we will ask you to provide us with a Personal ID, 
                    Password and Second Factor Authentication. This ensures that when you transact 
                    online with us, it will always be safe and secure.<br>
                    <br>
                    Skylight Financial web sites use temporary session cookies to assist us in 
                    securing your online activities and enhance the performance of the site. We 
                    examine group activity and do not watch individual browsing patterns.<br>
                    <br>
                    In addition, we also analyze our visitor trends to help us understand how our 
                    customers are using our web site. This enables us to build a more user-friendly 
                    experience. While your browser may allow you to "reject" cookies, our Web site 
                    requires that you accept all cookies in order for the Web site features and 
                    security mechanisms to function fully.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b><u>Using Information to Help Us</u></b><br>
                    Occasionally, you may encounter banner ads for Skylight Financial products and 
                    services on other Internet sites. We may use third party ad serving companies to 
                    distribute our ads on sites where we've paid to advertise. When you click on a 
                    Skylight Financial banner, it will take you to our site where the advertised 
                    product or service is found. Sometimes these ads contain small graphics or tags 
                    in them. These tags capture information such as IP address, browser type and 
                    pages being viewed when a user clicks on an ad so we can track the effectiveness 
                    of our advertising. These tags do not capture personal information about you. 
                    The vendors we use to distribute our ads are prohibited from using any 
                    information collected except to track advertising effectiveness.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b><u>Email</u></b><br>
                    We collect and keep the contents of email you send us in addition to your 
                    contact address and our response. This enables us to respond to your requests 
                    and questions. Email sent to us should be used for inquiries that are not 
                    sensitive or confidential as regular, non-encrypted Internet email (the email we 
                    use on most of the site) is not secure. If we need information beyond your name, 
                    address, email address and phone number, we will provide you with a secure email 
                    form. We will never request that you confirm your Personal ID, account numbers, 
                    Password or other sensitive information via email.<br>
                    <br>
                    We will ask for an email address when you set up a new account or service with 
                    us. We may use this address to communicate with you regarding our products and 
                    services.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b><u>Security of Online Sessions</u></b><br>
                    We are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your information and 
                    online transactions. We use the highest industry standard for online security -- 
                    Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption -- to secure your online sessions. This 
                    process safeguards your banking session from intruders.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b><u>Preventing Identity Theft</u></b><br>
                    Skylight Financial is dedicated to protecting your personal information. Strict 
                    policies and procedures have been implemented to ensure that your personal 
                    information is kept confidential. Only authorized signers can access account 
                    information. Every effort is made to protect our customers from fraud. We will 
                    never initiate a request for sensitive information from you via email (i.e., 
                    Social Security Number, Personal ID, Password, PIN or account number). If you 
                    receive an email that requests this type of sensitive information, you should be 
                    suspicious of it. We strongly suggest that you do not share your Personal ID, 
                    Password, PIN or account number with anyone, under any circumstances. If you 
                    receive a suspicious looking email, please forward it to contact@skylight.net or 
                    call our Customer Care Center toll-free at 1-800-686-3363.<br>

                    <b><u>Protecting Children Online</u></b><br>
                    Skylight Financial feels that it is extremely important to guard the identity 
                    and privacy of children, and we encourage parents to supervise their children's 
                    interactions online. We do not intentionally market to or solicit personal 
                    information from children under the age of 13. In the event that we receive 
                    personal information from a child whom we know to be under 13, we will only use 
                    that information to respond directly to that child or seek parental consent. For 
                    more information or to review information a child may have provided, call 
                    Skylight Financial Customer Service. For more information on the Children's 
                    Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), you can visit the Federal Trade

                    <b><u>Links to External Sites</u></b><br>
                    At times, we may provide links to sites outside the control of Skylight 
                    Financial to alert you to products, information and services offered by third 
                    parties. Provided links are meant to supplement Skylight Financial products, 
                    services or information or provide other information we believe may be of 
                    interest to you. Although we will only provide links to sites we believe are 
                    reputable, we do not make any representations concerning the linked sites' 
                    contents or availability. Please note that linked sites may have different 
                    privacy and information security policies than Skylight Financial. You should 
                    review each site's privacy and information security policies carefully before 
                    you enter confidential information onto the site.<br>

                    <b><u>External Aggregation Sites</u></b><br>
                    Please use caution when using external financial aggregation or consolidation 
                    services. Financial aggregation and consolidation services collect your personal 
                    information from a variety of sources on one site. For example, they could 
                    collect your checking and savings account balances at your bank, the value of 
                    your stocks and bonds in your brokerage account and your frequent flier mileage 
                    information from an airline. Financial aggregators do this by having you provide 
                    them with your identification information and password for each individual Web 
                    site, and then using these passwords to access each account. You must provide 
                    your permission and information to allow these services to collect this data. <b>
                    Never provide your account information or password to a site that you do not 
                    recognize and fully trust.</b><br>
                    <br>
                    <i>You should know: You will be unable to contest the validity of any Skylight 
                    Financial transaction initiated by a consolidation site using access information 
                    you provide</i>, whether or not you were aware of the specific transaction. You 
                    may revoke an aggregator's authority to access your account only by notifying 
                    us, in which case we may need to block your account until we issue new access 
                    codes.<br>
