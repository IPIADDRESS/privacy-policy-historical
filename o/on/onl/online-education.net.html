This policy describes the overall privacy practices of Online-Education.net regarding information we collect on our network of web sites and through our other Internet advertising mediums, including but not limited to email, newsletters, and leave-behinds. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Online-Education.net does not own or control, or to people that Online-Education.net does not employ.<br> <br></p>
<h2>Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>California has passed legislation requiring certain specific disclosures be made available to California residents who use the Internet and provide information that may be used for marketing purposes. That legislation requires any business that discloses a customer's personal information (as defined by the act) to any third party for direct marketing purposes to provide the customer a method for obtaining the names, addresses and certain other specified details of anyone who might have received that personal information. <br><br> If you are a California resident you may request this information from Online-Education.net or any of its affiliates by writing to us via email at <a href="mailto:info@quinstreet.com">info@quinstreet.com</a> or you may send us correspondence at the following address: Online-Education.net, Attn: Privacy, 950 Tower Lane, 6th Floor, Foster City, CA 94404.

In such situations, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be aware that Online-Education.net is very careful in selecting companies with whom it does business.<br><br> In addition to the above situations where your information may be shared with others, there is also the possibility that Online-Education.net, or part(s) of the company, may one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company.
