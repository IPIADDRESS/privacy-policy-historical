<p><strong>NON-personal Information</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Browser information</li>
<li>Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies</li>
<li>Demographic information and other information provided by you</li>
<li>Aggregated information</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How We Collect Non-Personal Information </strong></p>

We also aggregate Personal Information in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. We also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, or other similar technologies for example to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status or to measure the effectiveness of e-mail communications. We may link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>

<p><strong>How We Use and Disclose Non-Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose. &nbsp;In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>
<p><strong>IP ADDRESSES</strong></p>

<p><strong>How We Log IP Addresses </strong></p>
<p>An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use and Disclose IP Addresses?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, geographic mapping and administering the Site. We may also use and disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information. Please note that we treat IP Addresses, server log files and related information as Non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.</p>

<p><strong>Third Party VENDORS</strong></p>
<p>We also work with vendors and partners in operating and improving the Site.&nbsp; These vendors and other partners include advertisers (including both banner and text advertising), retargeters and web analytics companies.&nbsp; These partners and vendors use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited at the Site and at times other third party sites) in order to: help manage ad campaigns, understand user interests and trends and deliver personalized content and advertising to you while you are on the Site or on other sites.&nbsp; You can opt out of some of our vendors' use of cookies and other technologies to tailor personalized content or advertising to you by visiting <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a> and <a href="http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html">http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html</a>.&nbsp; Please note that if you delete all cookies, the opt-out cookie may be deleted and you will need to perform the opt out again.&nbsp; For more information, see &nbsp;http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/faqs.asp#question_11.</p>
