<td align="left">
<p class="text7"> OnlyCashSurveys is committed to safeguarding your privacy  online. Please
read the following policy to understand how your personal  information will
be treated as you make full use of our website and services.

</p><p class="text7"> OnlyCashSurveys adheres to the principles  set forth in the Safe Harbor
framework as established by the U.S. Department of  Commerce regarding the
collection, use, and retention of personally  identifiable information
provided to OnlyCashSurveys from the European Union.

</p><dl>

<dt> What personally identifiable  information does OnlyCashSurveys collect
from me?

</dt><dd>  OnlyCashSurveys collects information in  several ways from different
parts of our network of websites.

<p>  Some personal information is gathered  when you register. During
registration, OnlyCashSurveys asks for your name, email  address, zip code,
household information and personal interests. The more  information you
volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able  to
customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to
OnlyCashSurveys  - use to access the various protected areas of the
site.Also, if you contact OnlyCashSurveys we  may keep a record of that
correspondence.Whenever OnlyCashSurveys collects  personal information we
make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy  on that page.

</p></dd><dt>  What are cookies and how does OnlyCashSurveys  use them?

</dt><dd>  A cookie is a small amount of data  that is sent to your browser from
a web server and stored on your computer's  hard drive. As part of offering
and providing customizable and personalized  services, OnlyCashSurveys may
use cookies to store and sometimes track information  about you. Some areas
on OnlyCashSurveys where you are prompted to log-in or that  are
customizable may require that you accept cookies. This avoids you having to
enter your login information many times in one day.

</dd><dt>  Who is collecting information and for  what purpose?

</dt><dd>  OnlyCashSurveys collects valuable  information which assists in
developing new products and services. When you are  on a OnlyCashSurveys
site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing  that
information with OnlyCashSurveys alone, unless it is specifically stated
otherwise. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other
than OnlyCashSurveys -- or its parent company UnitedSample,Inc. , you will
be  notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do
not  want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer
by not  using that particular service.

<p>  Promotions that run on OnlyCashSurveys  may be sponsored by companies
other than OnlyCashSurveys or may be co-sponsored by OnlyCashSurveys  and
another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be
shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior
to  the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to
participate in  the promotion if you do not want your data to be shared.

</p><p>  Any Sensitive Information (i.e.  personal information specifying
medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic  origin, political opinions,
religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union  membership or information
specifying the sex life of the individual) will be  treated with additional
care. If OnlyCashSurveys intends to disclose such  information to a third
party or use it for a different purpose than originally  collected, then you
will be expressly asked permission prior to any such  disclosure.

</p><p>  Please be aware that OnlyCashSurveys  advertisers or websites that have
links on our site may collect personally  identifiable information about
you. The information practices of those websites  linked to OnlyCashSurveys
are not covered by this privacy statement.

</p></dd><dt>  With whom does OnlyCashSurveys share my  information?

</dt><dd>  As a general rule, OnlyCashSurveys will  not disclose any of your
personally identifiable information except when we  have your permission or
under special circumstances, such as when we believe in  good faith that the
law requires it or under the circumstances described below.  

<p>  Please see the Terms of Service or User Agreements for each of our
products and  services for more detailed information about how your personal
information may  be shared. The following describes some of the ways that
your information may  be disclosed.

</p></dd><dt> Business Partners &amp; Sponsors:

</dt><dd> OnlyCashSurveys  may disclose your personal information to business
partners or sponsors, but  this is specifically described to you prior to
data collection or prior to  transferring the data. If any personal data
about you were ever to be shared,  we will tell you before we collect or
transfer the data.

<p>  Many promotions offer opportunities  to request additional information
from sponsors. By requesting more  information, you give OnlyCashSurveys
permission to transfer your personal  information to the sponsor so they can
fulfill your request. In many instances,  only your email address will be
shared. If more information will be shared with  the sponsor, you will be
notified prior to the transfer.

</p><p>  Sharing <br>
We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.
We provide data with our partners only when our users select the services of our partners when they register. This is done by opting in or not opting out of their service. If you opt-in to our newsletter, we may partner with outside firms which will send out third party offers.
We share information gathered with partners that you select during the registration process. We may send you offers on behalf of other third parties. If we partner with other 3rd parties to send you offers, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out at any time.
These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

</p></dd><dt> Third Party Data &amp; Data in the  Aggregate:

</dt><dd> Under confidentiality agreements, OnlyCashSurveys may match user
information with third party data. Also, OnlyCashSurveys discloses
aggregated user  statistics (for example, 45% of our users are female) in
order to describe our  services to prospective partners, advertisers, and
other third parties, and for  other lawful purposes.

<p>  Other: OnlyCashSurveys may also disclose  account information in
special cases when we have reason to believe that  disclosing this
information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal  action against
someone who may be violating OnlyCashSurveyss Terms of Service or  may
be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or
unintentionally) OnlyCashSurveyss rights or property, other
OnlyCashSurveys users, or  anyone else that could be harmed by such
activities. OnlyCashSurveys may disclose  or access account information when
we believe in good faith that the law  requires it and for administrative
and other purposes that we deem necessary to  maintain, service, and improve
our products and services.

</p></dd><dt>  What are my choices regarding  collection, use, and distribution of my
information?

</dt><dd>  Only OnlyCashSurveys (or agents working  on behalf of OnlyCashSurveys
and under confidentiality agreements) will send you  these direct mailings
and only if you indicated that you do not object to these  offers.

<p>  You also have choices with respect to  cookies. By modifying your
browser preferences, you have the choice to accept  all cookies, to be
notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If  you choose to
reject all cookies you will be unable to use those OnlyCashSurveys  services
that require registration in order to participate.



</p></dd><dt> What is OnlyCashSurveys' policy on  allowing me to update, correct, or
delete my personally identifiable  information?

</dt><dd>  You may edit your OnlyCashSurveys Account  Information and your public
OnlyCashSurveys Profile at any time by using your OnlyCashSurveys  ID and
password. If you have forgotten your password, please click here.

<p>Your OnlyCashSurveys account can be  deleted or deactivated.

 Please contact <a href="mailto:support@surveyhelpcenter.com">support@surveyhelpcenter.com</a>
for further  instructions about deleting or deactivating your
OnlyCashSurveys account.

</p></dd><dt>  What security precautions are in place  to protect the loss, misuse,
or alteration of my information?

</dt><dd> Your OnlyCashSurveys Account Information  and OnlyCashSurveys Profile
are password-protected so that you and only you have  access to this
personal information.

<p>  We recommend that you do not divulge  your password to anyone.
OnlyCashSurveys will never ask you for your password in an  unsolicited
phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of  your
OnlyCashSurveys account and close your browser window when you have finished
your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal
information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or
are  using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.

</p><p>  Whenever OnlyCashSurveys handles personal  information as described
above, regardless of where this occurs, OnlyCashSurveys  takes steps to
ensure that your information is treated securely and in  accordance with the
relevant Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.

</p><p>  Unfortunately, no data transmission  over the Internet can be
guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we  strive to protect your
personal information, OnlyCashSurveys cannot ensure or  warrant the security
of any information you transmit to us or from our online  products or
services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your
transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

</p></dd><dt> What else should I know about my  privacy?

</dt><dd> Please keep in mind that whenever you  voluntarily disclose personal
information online - for example on message  boards, through email, or in
chat areas - that information can be collected and  used by others. In
short, if you post personal information online that is accessible  to the
public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in  return.

<p> Ultimately, you are solely  responsible for maintaining the secrecy of
your passwords and/or any account  information. Please be careful and
responsible whenever you're online.

</p></dd><dt> Additional information
