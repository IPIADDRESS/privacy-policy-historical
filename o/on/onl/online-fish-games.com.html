	    <p>This is the official privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") for AddictingGames.com ("Site," "we," "us," or "our"), an Internet website owned and operated by Atom Entertainment, Inc., a subsidiary of Viacom International Inc. This Privacy Policy governs only the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") collected by the Site and does not cover any such information collected in any other manner or for any other purpose, or for or by any other Viacom Media Networks Company programming channel, the Parent Companies, and any subsidiaries and affiliates of Atom Entertainment and the Parent Companies (collectively, "Affiliates"), or any other company, unless specifically stated.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>All requests sent via regular mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy Rights" on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request.</strong>For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code (your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email. Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping).&nbsp;<strong>We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile.</strong>&nbsp;We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.</p>
        <p>To all other users of this Site, if you have other questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact our Privacy Administrator at privacy-admin(at)atom.com. This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site, even if your use of or participation in any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason.</p>
        <p><strong>1.	Collection and Use of Personal Information:&nbsp;</strong>When we use the term "Personal Information" we mean information such as your first/middle initial or name and last name, street address, town or city, state, zip code, telephone number, instant-messenger nickname, blog or other personal website URL, date of birth, e-mail address and any other information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you. Personal Information also includes information such as lists of your friends' real names and their email addresses, instant-messenger nicknames or other personal identifiable information that you may add to such friend lists and your transactions or relationship with us, if you have been a user of the Site.</p>
        <p>We collect Personal Information about you when you visit the Site and input information, whether you are registering to use any features or functions of the Site, participating in Promotions (as defined in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.addictinggames.com/legal/terms-use.jsp">Terms of Use Agreement</a>, or in the course of any other exchanges of information, transactions and activities. We may use the information we obtain from you, including Personal Information, to tailor your experience of the Site, to display content we think may be of interest to you, or to let us customize what you see when you visit or use the Site according to your preferences.</p>
