							<b style="color:white;text-decoration:underline">INTRODUCTION</b><br><br>
							OnLive, Inc. (collectively, “OnLive” or “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy rights and personal information of our online visitors and users. We have adopted the OnLive Privacy Statement (“Privacy Policy”) to explain our policies and practices regarding how we collect, store, use, and protect the information you provide to us.
							<br><br>
							<b style="color:white">Scope of this Privacy Policy</b>
							<br><br>
							This Privacy Policy covers the information practices for the following websites and service:  <a href="http://www.onlive.com" class="txt_or" target="new">onlive.com</a> and any other OnLive-owned domain names that point to onlive.com (collectively, the “OnLive Websites” or “Websites”); and the OnLive Game Service (the “OnLive Service” or “Service”), which includes OnLive Customer Service (“CS”). Other websites and services owned and/or operated by or for OnLive contain their own privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only applies to information submitted and collected online by, through, or via the OnLive Websites and Service. This Privacy Policy is available for review on the Service and the OnLive Websites.
							<br><br>
							<b style="color:white">Contact Us</b>
							<br><br>
							If you have any comments, questions or complaints about this Privacy Policy or our information collection practices, please contact us via email at <a class="txt_or" href="mailto:privacy@onlive.com">privacy@onlive.com</a>; or, by regular mail to OnLive Inc.: 181 Lytton Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94301, Attn: Privacy Policy Administrator.
							<br><br>
							<b style="color:white">ESRB Certification</b>
							<div style="float:right;padding:20px 0px 0px 10px"><a href="http://www.esrb.org/confirm/onlive-confirmation.jsp" class="txt_or" target="new"><img src="../images/privacy_clicktoconfirm.gif" border="0"></a></div>
							<br><br>
							This Privacy Policy and the certification seal to the right confirm that OnLive is a valid licensee and participating member in the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (“ESRB”) Privacy Online Certified Program. To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative. The ESRB has reviewed and certified that the OnLive Websites and Service meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of the ESRB certification program, we are subject to frequent audits of our Websites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by the ESRB.  
 							<br><br>
    						<b style="color:white">Safe Harbor</b>
 							<br><br>
							OnLive adheres to a self-regulatory program in connection with the Safe Harbor framework developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union. As part of our participation in the Safe Harbor, we agree to resolve all disputes you have with us in connection with our policies and practices through the ESRB.
							</li>
							<li>
							<b style="color:white;text-decoration:underline">THE INFORMATION WE RECEIVE </b><br><br>
							There are several categories of information that we receive from you when you use the OnLive Websites and Service:  (A) information you provide to us; (B) information we collect from you; (C) information third parties collect from you; and (D) information we collect from your friends.
							<br><br>
							We do not require you to submit any more information than is necessary to use the Websites or Service effectively. You may visit and browse the informational sections of the Websites without providing any personal information. When we ask for personal information on the Websites and Service to, for instance, participate in an activity, set up an OnLive Service Account (“Account” or “ACCOUNT”) or make a purchase, we will not require anyone to disclose more personal information than we believe is reasonably necessary to participate in such activities. Each of the categories of information we receive from you is discussed below:
							<br><br>
								<ol class="tos_li4" style="color:#c3c3c3">
										<li>
										<b style="color:white">Information You Provide to Us</b><br><br>
										<i>Personal Information</i>:  When you sign up for OnLive’s Websites or Service, you may provide a variety of personal information including your first and last name, gender, email address, contact phone numbers, birth date, and mailing address. If you subscribe to the Service or make a purchase, you will provide credit card information, including credit card number, security code, expiration date, a shipping address (if necessary), and billing address. You may also provide additional personal information that you choose to include in an email that you send to us via the Websites, the Service, or through a resume you submit in connection with your interest in working for OnLive or one of its respective subsidiaries or affiliates. All of the above personal information, including any other material and non-public sensitive information tied to your personal information, is collectively referred to as “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy.
										<br><br>
										<i>Non-Personal Demographic Information</i>:  If you choose to complete surveys or your Player Profile, you may provide certain demographic information about yourself such as information about your lifestyle, personal tastes, purchasing habits, city and state,province, territory, education, job, and income.
										</li>
										<li>
										<b style="color:white">Information We Collect From You</b><br><br>
										In connection with our provision of the Websites and Service, we may collect the following non-personal information from you. The information identified in this section is combined with Personal Information in order to assist OnLive CS with community management, customer support, and technical support.
										<br><br>
										<i>Information About Your Computer and Connection to the Internet</i>:  We may collect information about your computer, hardware, software, platform, media, Internet IP address, connection information, geographic IP information, and details concerning your Internet service provider.
										<br><br>
										<i>Cookies</i>:  Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on the hard drive or memory of your computer or Internet access device. These cookies enable us to personalize your experience on the Websites, maintain a persistent session, passively collect demographic information about your computer and monitor advertisements and other activities. For example, cookies can advise us whether you have visited one of the OnLive Websites previously, and/or may contain other information that will facilitate your next visit to one of the OnLive Websites. Cookies do not include or collect Personal Information but rather, they identify your computer, usually by its Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. An “IP address” is a temporally unique number that can be used to identify your computer whenever you log on to the Internet.
										<br><br>
										Please remember that with most modern browsers you always can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer. The decision to disable cookies, however, may prevent you from being able to use certain portions of the OnLive Websites.
										<br><br>
										<i>Clear GIFs</i>:  Clear GIFs are small graphic images (in GIF or other image format) placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (e.g., only 1-by-1 pixel) and either transparent or the same color as the background of the web page, document or email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect Personal Information about you. We may, however, use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We may correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.
										<br><br>
										<i>Website &amp; Service Logs</i>:  OnLive may collect information in the form of Website and/or Service logs (collectively “Logs”). These Logs are files that record activity on the Websites and Service and gather statistics about users’ activities, such as how many users have visited the Websites, how often, how many “hits” a particular webpage has received, sign-in and sign-off times for the Service, type and quality of the user’s Internet connection to the Service, identification of the user’s hardware and software running the Service, which features on the Service you used, and the frequency of use. The entries comprising the Logs contain IP addresses, user IDs, and identification of the Internet service provider that provides your connection to the Internet. Generally, we use the Logs to operate and improve the Websites and Service, to identify the popularity of certain features, to assist with internal marketing and demographic studies, to enable us to assess overall efficiency and activity on the Websites and Service, and to assess users’ web-browsing and Service activities, preferences, and habits. We also use the Logs to monitor traffic on the Websites and Service, to troubleshoot technical problems, to support OnLive CS operations, for security reasons, and to foster the safety of the Websites and Service.
										<br><br>
										<i>Player Tags and Player Profiles</i>:  Player Tags are unique OnLive identifiers that can be seen on the OnLive Websites and Service. Player Profiles are personal summaries that may include the user’s Player Tag, presence on the Service, last log-on, use of content, gameplay statistics, and stated city/state or province/territory location that can be seen on the OnLive Websites and Service. In some cases, Player Tags and Player Profiles from the OnLive Websites and Service, may be made public by OnLive, our affiliates, subsidiaries, licensors, partners, or suppliers for the purposes of leaderboards, enhancing multiplayer gameplay, tournaments, and marketing and promotion efforts.  Because Player Tags and Player Profiles may be widely viewed we caution users to avoid using any personally identifiable information when creating Player Tags and Player Profiles.
										<br><br>
										<i>Brag Clips and Spectating</i>:  The Brag Clip™ video feature allows OnLive to make a video recording of some or all of your gameplay. Spectating allows OnLive to make available continuous viewing of the video of some or all of your gameplay, either live or delayed. Both OnLive features may show your Player Tag/Profile together with Brag Clip or Spectating video of your gameplay. Other people may view Brag Clip and Spectating video either through the Service or through other video delivery services or by means of recorded video media. You may choose to limit Brag Clip and/or Spectating video viewing to only OnLive users you’ve identified as Friends (described below), or to limit such viewing to no one other than yourself. If at any time you do not limit viewing of Brag Clip and Spectating video, OnLive may from that point forward use such videos both on the Service and externally for other purposes, including demonstrations, tournaments, marketing, promotional efforts, game refinement, engineering analysis or any other purpose. In some cases, use of certain game features or participation in certain promotions, tournaments and other activities will require you to allow other people to view Brag Clip and/or Spectating video. Because Brag Clip and Spectating video may be widely viewed, we caution users to avoid revealing any personally identifiable information during gameplay. Brag Clip and Spectating video are by default viewable by all OnLive users. You may disable viewing of these features through the Service.
										<br><br>
										<i>Communications Within the Service</i>:  OnLive may collect user email, instant messaging sessions, video, voice and text chats, online group activity, and any other forms of communication within the Service. Any user communications within the Service should not be considered private and such communications may be viewed and/or heard by others as part of gameplay, for example, as part of Brag Clip and Spectating video. OnLive is under no obligation to monitor user communications but will act on reports of misconduct or abuse of communications privileges. Because communications may be widely viewed and/or heard, we caution users to avoid revealing any personally identifiable information through communications. Additionally, OnLive may collect any communication between users and OnLive CS, including email, chat, voice and video communications, as well as any information sent from the user to OnLive CS, such as screen captures, video or audio recordings or data. OnLive CS may use such information as part of its customer service operations including collecting statistics, maintaining quality control and generating trouble tickets, which may be shared with appropriate OnLive internal groups or OnLive partners to address the problem or issue.
										</li>
										<li>
										<b style="color:white">Information Third Parties Collect From You</b><br><br>
										In some cases, access to third party content (e.g., games, other related game content, demos, trailers, videos, and graphics) requires connection to the third party content provider’s game server in addition to the OnLive Service. Such connections to a third party content provider’s server may be necessary in order to enable gameplay and/or access to certain content features. When this is necessary, the third party content provider will identify the nature of their data collection as well as the type of information collected in their terms of service, privacy policy, end user license agreement, and any other relevant disclosures. You may be required to accept a third party content provider’s terms of service, privacy policy, and end user license agreement (collectively, “Third Party Terms”) during the third party content purchasing process. You will have an opportunity to do this before you make the actual purchase. If you accept Third Party Terms, any information that is provided by you to the third party content provider or collected from you by the third party content provider will be subject to the applicable Third Party Terms.
										</li>
										<li>
										<b style="color:white">Information We Collect From Your Friends</b><br><br>
										<i>Friends</i>: OnLive provides social networking features that allow OnLive users to become “Friends” with each other. The Friends social networking feature allows you to identify certain OnLive users that you wish to distinguish from the general population of OnLive users. You may invite other users to become your Friend, and other users may invite you to become their Friend. Accepting a Friend request is voluntary, and you and/or other users may terminate a Friend association at any time. Only Friends have access to certain information, communications and video relating to your gameplay and Player Profile, including your list of Friends. Also, Friends of your Friends, and Friends of these Friends, etc., will have access to certain information, including but not limited to your list of Friends, Player Profile, and Brag Clip videos. You may stop sharing information with a specific Friend at any time by removing that Friend.

You consent to the sale and transfer of your information as described in this paragraph. If the successor entity intends to use your information for a purpose unrelated to that which it was originally collected, OnLive will contractually require the successor entity to provide you with notice of these new purposes and an opportunity to consent to such new purpose.
									</li>

Also, OnLive may suspend an Account, or resume a suspended Account, under certain conditions specified in the Terms of Service for the OnLive Game Service (“Terms of Service”), including, for example, the expiration or renewal of your Service membership term. OnLive may suspend your Account if it is inactive (i.e. you have not successfully logged in to the Service using your Account, or you have not made any transactions associated with your Account) for twelve (12) months. You or OnLive may resume (i.e. reactivate) a suspended Account, if the Account is in good standing and any outstanding concerns have been addressed, at any time during the suspension.
							<br><br>
							Suspending your Account will temporarily disable your access to the Service using the suspended Account, and temporarily disable your access to all content or services on the Service that the Account would otherwise have access to, if any, whether purchased or not. Resuming your Account will restore your access to the suspended Account, and restore your access to content and services that are still available to you after the time that has elapsed during the suspension period or provide access to content and services that became available to you during the suspension. During this time, OnLive will retain all of your information, including your Personal Information, just as if the Account is in active use so as to enable OnLive to (a) keep track of any content or service expirations or activations during the suspension period, and (b) reactivate your Account if it is resumed during that twelve (12) month period. During the suspension period you, or OnLive under certain conditions specified in the Terms of Service, may close your Account, per the terms described below in Closing Your Account. OnLive will close your Account if it not resumed within twelve (12) months of the last suspension. If you decide to suspend your Account, please contact OnLive Customer Service from the Support section of the OnLive website.
							<br><br>
							<b style="color:white">Closing Your Account</b>
							<br><br>
							<b style="color:white">CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT WILL RESULT IN PERMANENT LOSS OF ACCESS, CONTENT, SERVICES AND VALUE ON THE ONLIVE SERVICE. ONLIVE URGES YOU TO CONSIDER SUSPENDING YOUR ACCOUNT, PER THE “SUSPENDING YOUR ACCOUNT” SECTION ABOVE. RATHER THAN CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT, PLEASE READ THIS “CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT” SECTION CAREFULLY BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH CLOSURE.</b>
							<br><br>
							You may close your Account at any time, however, OnLive may close an Account if the Account is suspended and not resumed within the twelve (12) month maximum suspension period, as detailed in Suspending Your Account, above, or under certain conditions specified in the Terms of Service. Closing your Account will immediately and permanently terminate your access to the Service using the closed Account; immediately and permanently terminate your access to all content, messages, services on the Service that the closed Account would otherwise have access to or could derive value from; and result in your immediate and permanent forfeiture of any coupons, access passes, credits, or anything that may be of value directly or indirectly associated with the Account, if any, whether purchased or not. Any remaining payments due on the Account will remain due and collectable after the Account is closed until they are repaid. If you decide to close your Account, please contact OnLive Customer Service from the Support section of the OnLive website. Within six (6) months after closing your account or after any payments due on the Account are paid, whichever is later, we will delete all Personal Information other than (a) login-related information, such as your Player Tag, password, and email address, and (b) financial records as required for accounting, revenue-reporting and tax-reporting purposes.  We will retain your Personal Information for up to six months or until fees due are repaid after closing your Account to provide a means to restore the account in the event of an erroneous closure, to mitigate potential Account misconduct and to facilitate collection of any payments due. We will retain transaction-related information as required by law, to meet the requirements of our corporate accounting practices or as required to fulfill our obligations to our content and service providers and licensors. Please note that even after you remove information from your Account or delete your Account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent such information has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed, or it was copied or stored by other users.
							<br><br>
							OnLive does not delete login-related information, such as your Player Tag, password, or email address.  We keep this information in order to prevent fraudulent conduct under your Account and to enable us to adhere to your requests either to send or not to send marketing-related communications to you.
							<br><br>
							If you engage in any repeated or objectionable misconduct, to be determined within OnLive’s sole discretion, OnLive reserves the right to either suspend or close your Account, in OnLive’s sole discretion, immediately and without notice as set forth in the “Suspending Your Account” and “Closing Your Account” sections herein. Refer to the OnLive Community Guidelines for examples of objectionable conduct.

							<b style="color:white;text-decoration:underline">CREDIT CARD INFORMATION</b><br><br>
							When you make a purchase through the OnLive Websites or Service, we collect your credit card information. However, OnLive does not store, maintain, or process that information. Rather, OnLive uses trusted third party vendors to process and store your credit card information. These vendors are required to comply with applicable federal and state data security regulations, including Payment Card Industry Standards which require the safe, secure and confidential processing and storage of credit card information.
							</li>
							<li>
							<b style="color:white;text-decoration:underline">COMMUNICATIONS PREFERENCES</b><br><br>
							If you do not want OnLive to send you communications such as newsletters, announcements, or promotional offers, you may opt-out from receiving these communications at the time your Personal Information is originally collected through the communications preferences in your Account management page. Or, if you’d like to opt-out at a later date, opt-out instructions as well as instructions to update communications preferences will be included in the bottom portion of each email we send to you. You may also contact us by regular mail at the address listed in the “Contact Us” section herein. Please note that you may not opt-out from certain transactional or relationship messages (e.g., billing matters, Account reminders, legal updates) concerning your Account or products or services that you purchase from OnLive or that you use on the Service.

							<li>
							<b style="color:white;text-decoration:underline">THIRD PARTY LINKS</b><br><br>
							The Websites may contain links to third-party websites. Please be aware that OnLive cannot control and is not responsible for the information collection practices of such websites, which may differ from those of OnLive. We encourage you to review and understand the privacy policies of these websites before providing any information to them.

							<li>
							<b style="color:white;text-decoration:underline">DATA SECURITY</b><br><br>
							We maintain a variety of commercially reasonable safeguards designed to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access and disclosure, loss, misuse, alteration and destruction. For example, we use industry accepted tools and techniques to protect against unauthorized access to our systems, servers, Websites, and Service. Personal Information is stored behind firewalls, in password protected environments, and on servers in physically secure and access-controlled locations. Only authorized OnLive personnel may access this data. Sensitive financial information, like credit card data, is transmitted via industry standard encryption technologies. OnLive also regularly monitors its physical and information security for unauthorized access and attempts to access. In addition to these data security measures, OnLive maintains written security policies and provides ongoing training seminars regarding data security and the handling of Personal Information.
							<br><br>
							You should be aware, however, that OnLive has no control over the security of other websites or services on the Internet that you might visit even when a link may appear to direct you to websites and services from OnLive. If you share your computer or use a computer that is accessed by the general public, remember to sign off and close your browser window when you have finished your session. This will help to ensure that others cannot access your Personal Information.
							<br><br>
							We want you to feel confident using the Websites and Service. No system, however, can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take commercially reasonable steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information, other communications or content always will remain secure. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your Personal Information, we will notify you if reasonably possible and as reasonably necessary so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may notify you under such circumstances using the email address we have on record for you.  You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your Personal Information. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s Website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" target="new" class="txt_or">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.

							<b style="color:white;text-decoration:underline">CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b><br><br>
							We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the updated date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, including using previously collected Personal Information for a new purpose, we will notify users by sending an email to the email address provided to us by the user, and by prominently posting notice of the changes on the Websites and/or Service.

							<b style="color:white;text-decoration:underline">CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS UNDER CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1798.83</b><br><br>
							If you are a resident of California (“California Users”), in addition to the rights set forth in this Privacy Policy, you generally have the right to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide this information if it adopts and discloses to the public in its privacy policy a practice of not disclosing a user’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the user first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying California Users of their rights to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. As stated above, OnLive does not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you have requested us to do so, or have otherwise consented, and then subject to your right to opt-out of sharing your personal information for third party marketing purposes.
							<br><br>
							Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use your information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.
							<br><br>
							California Users may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@onlive.com" class="txt_or">privacy@onlive.com</a>. Please note that we only are required to respond to one request per user each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email address.
