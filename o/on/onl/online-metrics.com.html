Any capitalized terms not defined herein will have the same meaning as where they are defined elsewhere on our website.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Your Rights</strong></span><br>

<p><em><span style="color: #800000;">The right to restrict processing</span></em><br>
You have a right to ‘block’ or restrict the processing of your personal data. When your personal data is restricted, we are permitted to store your data, but not to process it further.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span><br>
‘Non-personal data’ (NPD) is information that is in no way personally identifiable.<br>
‘Personal data’ (PD) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. PD is in many ways the same as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, PD is broader in scope and covers more data.</p>
<p>A “visitor” is someone who merely browses our website. A “member” is someone who has registered with us to use or buy our services and products. The term “user” is a collective identifier that refers to either a visitor or a member.</p>

Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a small piece of data or a text file that is downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you access certain websites.

<p>By agreeing to accept our use of cookies, you are giving us, and third parties we partner with, permission to place, store, and access some or all the cookies described below on your computer.</p>
<p><em><strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong></em><br>
These cookies are necessary for proper functioning of the website, such as displaying content, logging in, validating your session, responding to your request for services, and other functions. Most web browsers can be set to disable the use of cookies. However, if you disable these cookies, you may not be able to access features on our website correctly or at all.</p>
<p><em><strong>Performance Cookies</strong></em><br>
These cookies collect information about the use of the website, such as pages visited, traffic sources, users’ interests, content management, and other website measurements.</p>

Our website uses Google Analytics to collect information about the use of our website. Google Analytics collects information from users such as age, gender, interests, demographics, how often they visit our website, what pages they visit, and what other websites they have used before coming to our website. We use the information we get from Google Analytics to analyze traffic, improve our marketing and to improve our website. On default, Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit our website, not your name or other identifying information. On our website, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #0000ff;">IP Anonymization</span></a> is applied. We do not combine the information collected using Google Analytics with PD.

Google also uses specific identifiers to help collect information about the use of our website.</p>
<p>For more information on how Google collects and processes your data, visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #0000ff;">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</span></a>.</p>

We do not sell or rent your PD to third parties for marketing purposes. However, for data aggregation purposes we may use your NPD, which might be sold to other parties at our discretion. Any such data aggregation would not contain any of your PD. We may provide your PD to third-party service providers we hire to provide services to us. These third-party service providers may include but are not limited to: payment processors, web analytics companies, advertising networks, call centers, data management services, help desk providers, accountants, law firms, auditors, shopping cart and email service providers, and shipping companies.</p>

<p><em><strong>Disclosures to Successors</strong></em><br>
If our business is sold or merges in whole or in part with another business that would become responsible for providing the website to you, we retain the right to transfer your PD to the new business. The new business would retain the right to use your PD according to the terms of this privacy notice as well as to any changes to this privacy notice as instituted by the new business.<br>
We also retain the right to transfer your PD if our company files for bankruptcy and some or all of our assets are sold to another individual or business.</p>
<p><em><strong>Community Discussion Boards</strong></em><br>
Our website may offer the ability for users to communicate with each other through online community discussion boards or other mechanisms. We do not filter or monitor what is posted on such discussion boards. If you choose to post on these discussion boards, you should use care when exposing any PD, as such information is not protected by our privacy notice nor are we liable if you choose to disclose your PD through such postings.

If you want to revoke your consent for us to use your PD, send us an email with your request to: paul@online-metrics.com.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000080; text-decoration: underline;">Protecting the Privacy Rights of Third Parties</span></strong></span><br>
If any postings you make on our website contain information about third parties, you must make sure you have permission to include that information in your posting. While we are not legally liable for the actions of our users, we will remove any postings about which we are notified, if such postings violate the privacy rights of others.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000080;"><strong>Do Not Track Settings</strong></span><br>
Some web browsers have settings that enable you to request that our website not track your movement within our website. Our website does not obey such settings when transmitted to and detected by our website. You can turn off tracking features and other security settings in your browser by referring to your browser’s user manual.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000080; text-decoration: underline;">Links to Other Websites</span></strong></span><br>
Our website may contain links to other websites. These websites are not under our control and are not subject to our privacy notice. These websites will likely have their own privacy notices. We have no responsibility for these websites and we provide links to these websites solely for your convenience. You acknowledge that your use of and access to these websites are solely at your risk. It is your responsibility to check the privacy notices of these websites to see how they treat your PD.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000080; text-decoration: underline;">Protecting Children’s Privacy</span></strong></span><br>
Even though our website is not designed for use by anyone under the age of 16, we realize that a child under the age of 16 may attempt to access our website. We do not knowingly collect PD from children under the age of 16. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child is using our website, please contact us. Before we remove any information, we may ask for proof of identification to prevent malicious removal of account information. If we discover that a child is accessing our website, we will delete his/her information within a reasonable period of time. You acknowledge that we do not verify the age of our users nor do we have any liability to do so.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000080; text-decoration: underline;">Our Email Policy</span></strong></span><br>
You can always opt out of receiving further email correspondence from us or our affiliates. We will not sell, rent, or trade your email address to any unaffiliated third party without your permission except in the sale or transfer of our business, or if our company files for bankruptcy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000080; text-decoration: underline;">Our Security Policy</span></strong></span><br>
We have built our website using industry-standard security measures and authentication tools to protect the security of your PD. We and the third parties who provide services for us, also maintain technical and physical safeguards to protect your PD. When we collect your credit card information through our website, we will encrypt it before it travels over the Internet using industry-standard technology for conducting secure online transactions. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee against the loss or misuse of your PD or secure data transmission over the Internet because of its nature.</p>
<p>We strongly urge you to protect any password you may have for our website and to not share it with anyone. You should always log out of our website when you finish using it, especially if you are sharing or using a computer in a public place.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000080;"><strong>Use of Your Credit Card</strong></span><br>
You may have to provide a credit card to buy products and services from our website. We use third-party billing services and have no control over these services. We use our commercially reasonable efforts to make sure your credit card number is kept strictly confidential by using only third-party billing services that use industry-standard encryption technology to protect your credit card number from unauthorized use. However, you understand and agree that we are in no way responsible for any misuse of your credit card number.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000080; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Transferring PD From the European Union</strong></span></span><br>
(PD) that we collect from you may be stored, processed, and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate, specifically The Netherlands. The European Union has not found the United States and some other countries to have an adequate level of protection of PD under Article 45 of the GDPR. Our company relies on derogations for specific situations as defined in Article 49 of the GDPR. For European Union customers and users, with your consent, your PD may be transferred outside the European Union to the United States and other countries. We will use your PD to provide the goods, services, and/or information you request from us to perform a contract with you or to satisfy a legitimate interest of our company in a manner that does not outweigh your freedoms and rights. Wherever we transfer, process or store your PD, we will take reasonable steps to protect it. We will use the information we collect from you in accordance with our privacy notice. By using our website, services, or products, you agree to the transfers of your PD described within this section.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000080; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Changes to Our Privacy Notice</strong></span></span><br>
We reserve the right to change this privacy notice at any time. If our company decides to change this privacy notice, we will post those changes on our website so that our users and customers are always aware of what information we collect, use, and disclose. If at any time we decide to disclose or use your PD in a method different from that specified at the time it was collected, we will provide advance notice by email (sent to the email address on file in your account). Otherwise we will use and disclose our users’ and customers’ PD in agreement with the privacy notice in effect when the information was collected. In all cases, your continued use of our website, services, and products after any change to this privacy notice will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
