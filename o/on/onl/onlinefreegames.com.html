                  <p>Cookies</p>
                  <p>
                  Gametop Pte.Ltd. may use cookies to improve the use of our websites. A cookie
                  is a small file that websites often store on a user's
                  computer. Storage of cookies on your system provides an easy and convenient
                  method for us to personalize your experience on our websites. For example, cookies
                  allow us to remember your screen name, tell us that you have visited our website
                  before, and may contain information that will make your next visit to our website
                  more enjoyable. However, we do not use cookies to store personal information
                  such as your name. In addition, Gametop Pte.Ltd. does not use cookies to retrieve
                  information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. You
                  can always disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are

                  <p>Gametop Pte.Ltd. may also collect your IP address for safety and security purposes.
                  An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify
                  your computer every time you log on to the Internet.</p>
                  <p>Log Files</p>
                  <p>Other non-personal information collected by Gametop Pte.Ltd. is in the form of
                  logs - files that record website activity, including how many hits
                  a particular web page is getting (a.k.a., click-through data). For
                  example, log file entries are generated every time a visitor clicks the "Online
                  Shop" icon on our site. These entries enable Gametop Pte.Ltd. to assess
                  overall site activity, track interest in advertised sales, track interest in
                  purchase behavior, and troubleshoot technical concerns.
                  Through the use of log files, we may also collect certain demographic information
                  such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer),
                  the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows 98 or Mac OS), and
                  the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).</p>
                  <p>Linking to third party sites</p>
                  <p>To provide relevant information not found on our Web site, Gametop Pte.Ltd. may
                  provide links from our Web sites to third party Web sites and we encourage our
                  users to read third party sites' privacy policies before submitting personal
                  information. Gametop Pte.Ltd. is not responsible for the privacy practices of
                  the content of third party sites'. Gametop Pte.Ltd. hereby disclaims any representations
                  or warranties expressed on any site other than its own site.</p>
                  <p>Who is collecting my personal information?</p>
                  <p>Any personal information that you disclose while visiting any of our websites
                  is collected by Gametop Pte.Ltd., and is used in the manner specified above.</p>
