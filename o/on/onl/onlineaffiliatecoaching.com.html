			<br>
			1. How We Protect Your Privacy. <br>
			<br>
			This privacy policy tells you how we collect, use, and protect your 
	personal information. By visiting our website, you accept and agree to the 
	terms and conditions of this privacy policy. In particular, you consent to 
	our collection and use of your personal information as described in this 
	privacy policy.<br>
			<br>
			2. Minors. <br>
			<br>
			We do not provide services or sell products to children. If you are 
	below the age of 18, you may use our website only with the permission and 
	active involvement of a parent or legal guardian. If you are a minor, please 
	do not provide us or other website visitors with any personal information. <br>
			<br>
			3. Policy Is Part Of Our Terms And Conditions Of Use.<br>
			<br>
			Our privacy policy is part of, and subject to, our website's terms 
	and conditions of use. You may view these terms and conditions by clicking 
	this link. <br>
			<br>
			4. The Type Of Information We Collect From You.<br>
			<br>
			Like most places on the Internet, simply by visiting our website you 
	automatically tell us certain information. This includes basic information 
	such as your IP address, when you visited, the website from where you came 
	prior to visiting us, the website where you go when you leave our website, 
	your computer's operating system, and the type of web browser that you are 
	using. Our website automatically records this basic information about you.<br>
			<br>
			And like many other websites, we may use cookies. In plain English, 
	this means information that our website's server transfers to your computer. 
	This information can be used to track your session on our website. Cookies 
	may also be used to customize our website content for you as an individual. 
	If you are using one of the common Internet web browsers, you can set up 
	your browser to either let you know when you receive a cookie or to deny 
	cookie access to your computer.<br>
			<br>
			We may also collect any data that you provide us by posting it at 
	our website or by e-mail. You can always choose not to provide us with 
	information. However, if you do withhold information, we may deny you access 
	to some or all of our website's services and features.<br>
			<br>
			Some transactions between you and our website may involve payment by 
	credit card, debit card, checks, money orders, and/or third party online 
	payment services. In such transactions, we will collect information related 
	to the transaction as part of the course of doing business with you, 
	including your billing address, telephone number, and other information 
	related to the transaction.<br>
			<br>
			5. What We Do With Your Information.<br>
			<br>
			We use your information to operate our website's business 
	activities. For example, we may use this data to contact you about changes 
	to our website, new services, or special offers, resolve disputes, 
	troubleshoot issues, and enforce our website's terms and conditions.<br>
			<br>
			As a general rule, we will not give your data to third parties 
	without your permission. However, there are some important exceptions to 
	this rule that are described in the following paragraphs.<br>
			<br>
			We may, in our sole discretion, provide information about you to law 
	enforcement or other government officials for purposes of fraud 
	investigations, alleged intellectual property infringement, or any other 
	suspected illegal activity or matters that may expose us to legal liability.<br>
			<br>
			Although we do not disclose individually identifiable information, 
	we may disclose aggregate data about our website's visitors to advertisers 
	or other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. <br>
			<br>
			From time to time, we may use third party suppliers to provide 
	services on our website. If a supplier wants to collect information about 
	you, you will be notified. However, you will never be required to give 
	information to a third party supplier. We restrict the way third party 
	suppliers can use your information. They are not allowed to sell or give 
	your information to others.<br>
			<br>
			6. User Names And Passwords.<br>
			<br>
			Your access to parts of our website may be protected by a user name 
	and a password. Do not give your password to anyone. If you enter a section 
	of our website that requires a password, you should log out when you leave. 
	As a safety precaution, you should also close out of your web browser 
	completely and re-open it before viewing other parts of the Internet.<br>
			<br>
			7. Your Use Of Information And Unsolicited Junk E-Mail.<br>
			<br>
			If you obtain personally identifiable information about another 
	website user, you are not allowed to disclose this information to anyone 
	else without the consent of the user and our consent too.<br>
			<br>
			We hate junk e-mail (Spam). Information you obtain from our website 
	about us or other site users cannot be used by you or others to send 
	unsolicited commercial e-mail or to send unsolicited commercial 
	communications via our website's posting or other communication systems. <br>
			<br>
			8. Your Voluntary Disclosure Of Information To Third Parties Who Are 
	Not Our Suppliers.<br>
			<br>
			You may choose to provide personal information to website visitors 
	or other third parties who are not our suppliers. Please use caution when 
	doing so. The privacy policies and customs of these third parties determine 
	what is done with your information.<br>
			<br>
			9. Autoresponders.<br>
			<br>
			We may use autoresponders to communicate with you by e-mail. To 
	protect your privacy, we use a verified opt-in system for such 
	communications and you can always opt-out of such communications using the 
	links contained in each autoresponder message. If you have difficulties 
	opting out, send us mail to the address listed below.<br>
			<br>
			10. Policy Changes.<br>
			<br>
			The terms of this policy may change from time to time. If such 
	changes are made, we will notify you by a notice posted on our website's 
	home page of the changes that have been made. If you disagree with the 
	changes that have been made, please contact us (by e-mail, using a website 
	contact form, or in writing by mail), and any changes made to this policy 
	will not apply to information we have collected from you prior to making the 
	changes.<br>
			<br>
			If you are concerned about the topic covered by this policy, you 
	should read it each time before you use our website. Any questions or 
	concerns about this policy should be brought to our attention by sending an 
	e-mail to Legal (at) clickbankcodebreaker.com (replacing the "(at)" with the
