      Our site contains unique features developed especially to preserve and enhance 
      User privacy. Registered Users have the option to communicate by using our 
      O-mail system. O-mail is onsite communication that works much like e-mail, 
      but it allows Users to communicate without revealing personally identifiable 
      information such as their name or e-mail address. Users may display or offer 
      their e-mail address or other personal contact information onsite, at their 
      own discretion. Personally identifiable User information is not published 
      or offered in any way to third parties. User privacy is a key concern in 
      the continuing development of OnlineAuction.com. </font></font>

        Our User Registration requires Users to give us contact information, or 
        personally identifiable information such as their name, phone number, 
        mailing address, registered username / password and e-mail address. Our 
        site does not use "cookies" or any other method of collecting User information 
        that is not specifically given to us by the User. Users may edit or update 
        their registered personally identifiable information at any time by visiting 
        the <a href="/cgi-bin/custom/user_info"><b>User Info</b></a> page. Users 
        may establish an optional account by supplying us with valid credit card 
        data.</font> 
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
        use User contact information from our registration form to send users 
        information about us. User contact information is also used to make direct 
        contact as requested by the User, or when necessary for us to personally 
        assist the User. Any financial information being collected is used only 
        to verify User qualifications for establishing a payment account and billing 
        for services or products purchased directly from OnlineAuction.com. We 
        use User IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to 
        administer our Website. User IP addresses are also used to help identify 
        users and to give us broad demographic information. This site often contains 
        links to other sites. OnlineAuction.com is not responsible for the content, 
        privacy or practices of any other web site. Our online surveys ask visitors 
        for unique identifiers known onsite as usernames, used to verify User 
        identity and for individual User account identification. We offer contests 
        on our site in which we ask registered Users to submit their Username
