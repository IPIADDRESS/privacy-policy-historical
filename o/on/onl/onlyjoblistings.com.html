<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">This policy applies 
to ONLYJOBLISTINGS's collection, use, storage and disclosure of information 
by ONLYJOBLISTINGS on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries 
and related companies (collectively, the "Websites"), (b) 
on various third party websites, and (c) to ONLYJOBLISTINGS's other information 
collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. 
ONLYJOBLISTINGS is not responsible for the information collection or privacy 
practices of third web sites or applications.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1. Collection of 
Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1.1 Survey Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">ONLYJOBLISTINGS collects 
information from individuals by various methods, including, but not 
limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an ONLYJOBLISTINGS survey, 
order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means 
of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated 
by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, 
"online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, 
and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other 
than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones 
and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, ONLYJOBLISTINGS 
or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to 
provide various information to ONLYJOBLISTINGS, which may include his or 
her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers 
(including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary 
range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, 
employment information, personal and online interests, and such other 
information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey 
Information"). ONLYJOBLISTINGS may also collect information concerning 
an individual from another source and uses that information in combination 
with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys 
is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to 
provide Survey Information to ONLYJOBLISTINGS or Third Party, but an individual 
may receive incentives from ONLYJOBLISTINGS or a Third Party in exchange 
for providing Survey Information to ONLYJOBLISTINGS.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1.2 Third Party 
List Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">ONLYJOBLISTINGS collects 
information from individuals when an individual provides information 
to a third party and ONLYJOBLISTINGS subsequently purchases, licenses, or 
otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the "Seller"). 
Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's 
name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including 
cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, 
education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal 
and online interests, and such other information as the individual may 
have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). 
When acquiring Third Party List Information, ONLYJOBLISTINGS seeks assurances 
from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party 
List Information to ONLYJOBLISTINGS and that the Seller has a right to provide 
offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information 
is included on the Seller's list.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1.3 Other Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">Other occasions when 
ONLYJOBLISTINGS obtains information from individuals include (1) when an 
individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive 
offered by ONLYJOBLISTINGS or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests 
assistance through ONLYJOBLISTINGS's customer service department, and (3) 
when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a ONLYJOBLISTINGS service or 
newsletter (together, "Other Information").</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1.4 Cookies, Web 
Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">ONLYJOBLISTINGS currently 
uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related 
information about an individual with information about the individual 
in our database. Additionally, ONLYJOBLISTINGS may use other new and evolving 
sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>(a) Cookies.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">A cookie is a small 
amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer 
that allows ONLYJOBLISTINGS to identify the individual with his or her corresponding 
data that resides in ONLYJOBLISTINGS's database. You may read more about 
cookies at <a href="http://cookiecentral.com" target="_blank">http://cookiecentral.com</a>. Individuals who use the Websites 
need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality 
of the Websites.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>(b) Web Beacons.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">A web beacon is programming 
code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an 
&lt;img src="x"&gt; programming function -- see <a href="http://truste.org" target="_blank">http://truste.org</a> 
for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's 
unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database 
and associate the individual with previously acquired information about 
an individual in a database. This allows ONLYJOBLISTINGS to track certain 
web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine 
products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track 
online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, ONLYJOBLISTINGS 
might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon 
on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Joe, 
an individual listed in ONLYJOBLISTINGS's database, visits the fishing website, 
ONLYJOBLISTINGS receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited 
the fishing site, and ONLYJOBLISTINGS would then update Joe's profile with 
the information that Joe is interested in fishing. ONLYJOBLISTINGS may thereafter 
present offers of fishing related products and services to Joe. In addition 
to using web beacons on web pages, ONLYJOBLISTINGS also uses web beacons 
in email messages sent to individuals listed in ONLYJOBLISTINGS's database.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>(c) New Technology.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">The use of technology 
on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, 
as is ONLYJOBLISTINGS's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, 
ONLYJOBLISTINGS strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for 
any updates regarding its use of technology.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1.5 Outside Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">ONLYJOBLISTINGS may receive 
information about individuals from third parties or from other sources 
of information outside of ONLYJOBLISTINGS including information located in 
public databases ("Outside Information").</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1.6 Individual Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">As used herein, Individual 
Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, 
Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, 
and any other information ONLYJOBLISTINGS gathers or receives about individuals.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1.7 No Information 
Collected from Children.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">ONLYJOBLISTINGS will never 
knowingly collect any personal information about children under the 
age of 13. If ONLYJOBLISTINGS obtains actual knowledge that it has collected 
personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information 
will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect 
such information, ONLYJOBLISTINGS has no such information to use or to disclose 
to third parties. ONLYJOBLISTINGS has designed this policy in order to comply 
with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1.8 Credit Card 
Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">ONLYJOBLISTINGS may in certain 
cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the 
expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when 
an individual places an order from ONLYJOBLISTINGS. When the Credit Card 
Information is submitted to ONLYJOBLISTINGS, such information is encrypted 
and is protected with SSL encryption software. ONLYJOBLISTINGS will use the 
Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the 
purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed 
to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>2. 
Use of Individual Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>2.1 Discretion to 
Use Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">THE COMPANY MAY USE 
INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S 
SOLE DISCRETION.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">The following paragraphs 
in Section 2 describe how ONLYJOBLISTINGS currently uses Individual Information, 
but ONLYJOBLISTINGS may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted below, 
ONLYJOBLISTINGS may update this policy from time to time. ONLYJOBLISTINGS may 
use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals 
by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, 
online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible 
uses.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>2.2 Email.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">ONLYJOBLISTINGS uses Individual 
Information to provide promotional offers by email to individuals. ONLYJOBLISTINGS 
may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If email recipients 
wish to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need 
to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe 
from the particular list. To unsubscribe from all ONLYJOBLISTINGS</font><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Arial Unicode MS">’</font><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">s 
email lists, a person must visit: <a href="http://www.onlyjoblistings.com" target="_blank">www.onlyjoblistings.com</a></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>2.2(a) Content of 
Email Messages.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">In certain commercial 
email messages sent by ONLYJOBLISTINGS, an advertiser's name will appear 
in the "From:" line but hitting the "Reply" button 
will cause a reply email to be sent to ONLYJOBLISTINGS. The "Subject:" 
line of ONLYJOBLISTINGS email messages will usually contain a line provided 
from the advertiser to ONLYJOBLISTINGS.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>2.2(b) Solicited 
Email.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">ONLYJOBLISTINGS only sends 
email to individuals who have agreed on the Websites to receive email 
from ONLYJOBLISTINGS or to individuals who have agreed on third party websites 
to receive email from third parties such as ONLYJOBLISTINGS. ONLYJOBLISTINGS does 
not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes requiring 
certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to ONLYJOBLISTINGS's 
email messages.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>2.3 Targeted Advertising.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">ONLYJOBLISTINGS uses Individual 
Information to target advertising to an individual. When an individual 
is using the Internet, ONLYJOBLISTINGS uses Technology Information (see also 
Section 2.5 below) to associate an individual with that person's Individual 
Information, and ONLYJOBLISTINGS attempts to show advertising for products 
and services in which the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys, 
indicated an interest by means of Technology Information, and otherwise. 
ONLYJOBLISTINGS may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, 
direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication 
to provide promotional offers.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>2.4 Direct Mail 
and Telemarketing.</b></font></p>

Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">ONLYJOBLISTINGS uses Technology 
Information (1) to match a person's Survey Information and Third Party 
List Information to other categories of Individual Information to make 
and improve profiles of individuals, (2) to track a person's online 
browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine which areas of ONLYJOBLISTINGS's 
web sites are most frequently visited. This information helps ONLYJOBLISTINGS 
to better understand the online habits of individuals so that ONLYJOBLISTINGS 
can target advertising and promotions to them.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>2.6 Profiles of 
Individuals.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">ONLYJOBLISTINGS uses Individual 
Information to make a profile of an individual. A profile can be created 
by combining Survey Information and Third Party List Information with 
other sources of Individual Information such as information obtained 
from public databases.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>2.7 Storage of Individual 
Information</b>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">ONLYJOBLISTINGS stores the 
Individual Information in a database on ONLYJOBLISTINGS computers. Our computers 
have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against 
the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under ONLYJOBLISTINGS's 
control. Not withstanding such measures, ONLYJOBLISTINGS cannot guarantee 
that its security measures will prevent ONLYJOBLISTINGS computers from being 
illegally accessed, and the Individual Information on them stolen or 
altered.</font></p>
