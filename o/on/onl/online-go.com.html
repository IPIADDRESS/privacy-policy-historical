<h1>Online-go.com privacy policy</h1>

<h2>Effective Date</h2>

<p>This policy is effective as of 28/11/2005. We reserve the right to change
this privacy policy from time to time, and any changes that we make will be
effective immediately. Please check back periodically to ensure that you are
up to date.</p>

<h2>Information you provide to share</h2>

<p>Any information that you choose to make public through your username and
the settings you create in your preference screen will be visible to all those
who register on this site. We are not responsible for any misuse of this
information by third parties, so please only put up information you are happy
being public domain. Any profane or offensive profiles will be edited to
remove the profanity, and consistent re-entering of aforesaid inappropriate
material may result in account suspension. If you feel that another user is
being offensive, either over a game or in their profile, do let us know.</p>

<h2>Registration information</h2>

<p>Your password and email address are encrypted and kept securely in our
database, and will not be supplied, for money or otherwise, to any third party
organisation or person. We hate spam as much as the rest of the World, and the
security of this information is of great importance to us.</p>

<h2>Other logged information</h2>

<p>Your IP address and other such information may well be logged, and will once
again be stored securely without any public access. The only time we will choose
to use this information is if there are reports of a) an account being hacked,
or b) there are genuine problems with the site that may be due to ISPs or other
reasons in which your IP address will help resolve the problem. As with emails,
we place the highest priority in the security of this information.</p>

<h2>External Links</h2>

<p>This site contains links to sites outside of our control that we feel are
relevant to online-go.com. We do not take responsibility for any damages that
may be incurred by visiting these sites, though if we are informed and find that
sites that we link to have become dangerous or unsuitable for children to view,
they will be removed from the site.</p>
