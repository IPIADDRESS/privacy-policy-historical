				    <p class="Estilo1">Thank you for visiting this   web site. We understand the importance that Internet users place on   privacy, and this Privacy Policy describes how we use personal information   that is collected at this web site. Please read this Privacy Policy   before using this site or submitting any personal information. By using   this web site, you accept the privacy practices contained in this Privacy   Policy. These privacy practices may change from time to time, but any   changes will be posted. You are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy   whenever you visit the web site to make sure you understand how any   personal information you provide will be used.</p>
				    <p class="Estilo1"><strong>Information We Collect</strong>&nbsp;<br>
				      In order to serve our customers, we collect personally identifiable   information, like names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses,   and sometimes credit card information when such information is voluntarily   submitted by our visitors. We may use your personal information, transfer   your personal information, and/or sell your personal information for   any legal purpose, including, without limitation: (1) to deliver the   products and/or services to you that you have requested; (2) to validate   your compliance with the terms and conditions; (3) for content improvement   and feedback purposes; (4) to reach you, when necessary, regarding your   use of the web site or product(s); and (5) to bring retail opportunities   and promotional offers to you by email, direct mail, telemarketing,   and/or online banner advertising. When your information is provided   to third parties, these third parties may include providers of direct   marketing services and applications. We or these third parties may supplement   the information we collect online with outside records to enhance our   ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and/or to offer   you targeted advertising and other opportunities to purchase products   and services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
				    <p class="Estilo1">You also enable us to personalize your   experience with us so that we can provide you with the highest quality   of service. By submitting your email address on this web site, you agree   to receive email from us and our third party advertisers. We, and our   third party advertisers, may maintain separate email lists for different   purposes. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists   at any time by clicking the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option   that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people   who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through   a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because   we hate spam as much as you do.</p>
				    <p class="Estilo1">In addition, you agree that   by submitting your email address on this web site and/or registering   to receive the product and/or service offered herein, such act constitutes   a purchase, an inquiry, and/or an application for the purposes of the   Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (ATSR), 16 CFR ‘310 et seq. and any   applicable state and local “do not call” regulations. We and our   third party advertisers retain the right to contact you via telemarketing   in accordance with the ATSR and the applicable state regulations. </p>
				    <p class="Estilo1">&nbsp;<br>
                        <strong>Third Party Actions&nbsp;<br>
                      </strong>We do not control and are not liable for the actions of our third   party marketers or advertisers. We pride ourselves in working with quality   companies, but have no control over the actions of those third parties.   While we are not liable for any of the actions of those third parties,   you should feel free to give us feedback from time to time on your experiences   with any third parties to whom we work with so that we may enhance our   future service to all customers.</p>
				    <p class="Estilo1"><strong>Cookies</strong>&nbsp;<br>
				      We may use cookies to deliver content that is specific to your interests.   Cookies are text files that are used by your computer’s web browser   to store your preferences, and enable us to enhance your user experience   with our web site. </p>
				    <p class="Estilo1"><strong>IP Addresses&nbsp;<br>
                    </strong>We may use your IP address to help prevent fraud, to help diagnose   problems with our server, to gather broad demographic information, and   to offer you products and services.</p>
				    <p class="Estilo1"><strong>Third Party Web Sites</strong>&nbsp;<br>
				      This web site and/or the products and/or services offered herein may   direct you to web sites that are owned and/or controlled by third parties.   We have no control over those third parties and are not responsible   for the content or the privacy practices of those sites or companies.</p>
				    <p class="Estilo1"><strong>Commitment to Data Security</strong>&nbsp;<br>
				      All information collected from you is stored in a technically and physically   secure environment. We use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information   online, and we do everything we can to protect user information offline.   Unfortunately, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to   be 100% secure. As a result, while we take reasonable measures to protect   your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of the information   that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
				    <p class="Estilo1"><strong>Contacting Us</strong>&nbsp;<br>
				      If you need to contact us, you can email   us at <a href="mailto:info@onlineprofitsplus.com">info@onlineprofitsplus.com</a>, or submit a ticket to us through our <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> page.</p>
				    <p class="Estilo1">&nbsp;<br>
				      We strive to provide excellent products, along with equally excellent   customer service. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy   or our practices, please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> at any time. We will be more than glad to solve any doubts that you might have.</p>
