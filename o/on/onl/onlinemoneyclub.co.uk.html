		<h1><span style="color: #000000;">Privacy Policy</span></h1>
<h3>David Henry &amp; onlinemoneyclub.co.uk privacy policy compliant with GDPR</h3>
<h3>Updated 24th May 2018</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This privacy policy sets out how David Henry uses and protects any information that you give David Henry when you use this website.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">David Henry is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this website, then you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">David Henry may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes. This policy is effective from May 25th 2018</span></p>
<h3>Your legal rights</h3>
<p>Under data protection laws you have rights in relation to your personal data that include the right to request access, correction, erasure, restriction, transfer, to object to processing, to portability of data and (where the lawful ground of processing is consent) to withdraw consent.</p>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please email me at david@plrprofitsclub.com or <a href="https://davidjen.supportsystem.com/">open a support ticket here</a></p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).</p>
<p>However, I may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive or refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p>When accessing the http://onlinemoneyclub.co.uk&nbsp; website, we will learn certain information about you during your visit.</p>
<p>Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard technology called “cookies” (see explanation below) and server logs to collect information about how our site is used. Information gathered through cookies and server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our site, and the websites visited just before and just after our own, as well as your IP address.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that sits computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s a cookie?</strong></p>
<p>A “cookie” is a piece of information that is stored on your computer’s hard drive and which records how you move your way around a website so that, when you revisit that website, it can present tailored options based on the information stored about your last visit. Cookies can also be used to analyse traffic and for advertising and marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Cookies are used by nearly all websites and do not harm your system.</p>
<p>If you want to check or change what types of cookies you accept, this can usually be altered within your browser settings. You can block cookies at any time by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of my websites.</p>
<p><strong>How do I use cookies?</strong></p>
<p>I use cookies to track your use of my website. This enables me to understand how you use the site and track any patterns with regards how you are using my website. This helps me to develop and improve my website as well as products and / or services in response to what you might need or want.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies are either:</strong></p>
<p>Session cookies: these are only stored on your computer during your web session and are automatically deleted when you close your browser – they usually store an anonymous session ID allowing you to browse a website without having to log in to each page but they do not collect any personal data from your computer; or</p>
<p>Persistent cookies: a persistent cookie is stored as a file on your computer and it remains there when you close your web browser. The cookie can be read by the website that created it when you visit that website again.&nbsp; I use persistent cookies sometimes when using platforms such as Google Analytics and Clickfunnels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cookies can also be categorised as follows:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strictly necessary cookies: These cookies are essential to enable you to use the website effectively, such as when buying a product and / or service, and therefore cannot be turned off. Without these cookies, the services available to you on my website cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Performance cookies: These cookies enable me to monitor and improve the performance of my websites. For example, they allow me to count visits, identify traffic sources and see which parts of the site are most popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Functionality cookies: These cookies allow my website to remember choices you make and provide enhanced features. For instance, I may be able to provide you with news or updates relevant to the services you use. They may also be used to provide services you have requested such as viewing a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect is usually anonymised.</p>
<p><strong>IP Addresses</strong></p>
<p>IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.</p>
<p><strong>What data do we collect about you?</strong></p>
<p>Personal data means any information capable of identifying an individual. It does not include anonymised data.</p>
<p>We may process certain types of personal data about you as follows:</p>
<p>Identity Data may include your first name, maiden name, last name, username, marital status, title, date of birth and gender.</p>
<p>Contact Data may include your billing address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers.</p>
<p>Financial Data may include your bank account and payment card details.</p>
<p>Transaction Data may include details about payments between us and other details of purchases made by you.</p>
<p>Technical Data may include your login data, internet protocol addresses, browser type and version, browser plug-in types and versions, time zone setting and location, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access this site.</p>
<p>Profile Data may include your username and password, purchases or orders, your interests, preferences, feedback and survey responses.</p>
<p>Usage Data may include information about how you use our website, products and services.</p>
<p>Marketing and Communications Data may include your preferences in receiving marketing communications from us and our third parties and your communication preferences.</p>
<p>We may also process Aggregated Data from your personal data, but this data does not reveal your identity and as such is not personal data. An example of this is where we review your Usage Data to work out the percentage of website users using a specific feature of our site.</p>
<p>If we link the Aggregated Data with your personal data so that you can be identified from it, then it is treated as personal data.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitive Data</strong></p>
<p>We do not collect any Sensitive Data about you. Sensitive data refers to data that includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data. We do not collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.</p>
<p>Where we are required to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of the contract between us and you do not provide us with that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract (for example, to deliver goods or services to you). If you don’t provide us with the requested data, we may have to cancel a product or service you have ordered but if we do, we will notify you at the time.</p>
<p><strong>How we collect your personal data</strong></p>
<p>We collect data about you through a variety of different methods including:</p>
<p>Direct interactions: You may provide data by filling in forms on our site (or otherwise) or by communicating with us by post, phone, email or otherwise, including when you:</p>
<p>Order our products or services;</p>
<p>Create an account on our site;</p>
<p>Subscribe to our service or publications;</p>
<p>Request resources or marketing be sent to you;</p>
<p>Join a giveaway event either as a contributor or free member;</p>
<p>Enter a competition, prize draw, promotion or survey;</p>
<p>Give us feedback.</p>
<p>Automated technologies or interactions: As you use our site, we may automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing actions and usage patterns. We collect this data by using cookies, server logs and similar technologies. We may also receive Technical Data about you if you visit other websites that use our cookies. Please see our cookie policy for further details.</p>
<p>Third parties or publicly available sources: We may receive personal data about you from various third parties and public sources as set out below:</p>
<p>Technical Data from the following parties:</p>
<p>Analytics providers such as Google based outside the EU;</p>
<p>Analytics providers such as Facebook based outside the EU;</p>
<p>Advertising networks [such as [Facebook/Google/Youtube/Instagram/Twitter/Hotjar/Also Re-targeting services provided by these companies] based [inside OR outside] the EU];</p>

<p>Where we need to perform the contract between us.</p>
<p>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</p>
<p>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</p>
<p>Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal ground for processing your personal data, other than in relation to sending marketing communications to you via email or text message.</p>
<p>You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by clicking on our Unsubscribe link at the bottom of every one of our email communications or by <a href="https://davidjen.supportsystem.com/">submitting a support ticket by Clicking Here</a></p>
