information under the following circumstances: </p><p><b>Affiliates:</b> We 
may  share your name, address, and information about your transactions and  
experiences with us (such as your payment history or other facts about your  
account) with our affiliates. </p><p><b>Agents and service providers:</b> To  
establish, administer, and manage our customers' accounts, evaluate credit,  
provide customer service and benefits, process account transactions and account  
statements, engage in collections activities, or process job applications, we  
may disclose your personal information to companies that work with us to 
perform  services or business operations on our behalf. We may also share your 
personal  information with companies that perform marketing services on our 
behalf, or  with other financial institutions (including insurance companies) 
with whom we  have joint marketing agreements. </p><p><b>Nonaffiliated third 
parties:</b> In  certain instances, we are permitted or even required to 
disclose your personal  information to nonaffiliated third parties. For 
example,  reporting your  transaction history and information with us to credit 
reporting  agencies,  responding to regulators or auditors, to protect against 
fraud, or to  provide  information in connection with proposed or actual 
business transactions  involving CIT companies or accounts. We may also disclose 
your personal  information to third parties when legally compelled to do so, 
such as to comply  with the law, to enforce our terms of use, or to protect the 
rights, property,  or safety of CIT, its employees, customers, visitors to these 
Services, and  others. Please be aware that these disclosures are permitted by 
law without  your  consent. </p><p><b>Other third parties:</b> We may also 
share, as  permitted by  law, your personal information with other third parties 
with whom  we do not have  joint marketing agreements, such as other financial 
services  providers and  insurance companies, or with nonfinancial companies, 
such as  service  organizations, retailers, travel services and direct 
marketers. We  require these  companies to adhere to CIT's confidentiality 
standards with  respect to your  personal information. </p><p><b>USA Patriot 
Act Section 326  compliance:</b> When you open an account with us, we will ask 
for your name,  address, and other  identifying documents such as your driver's 
license, that  will allow us to  identify you. We do this to help the government 
fight the  funding of terrorism  and money laundering activities. U.S. federal 
law requires  all financial  institutions to obtain, verify, and record 
information that  identifies each  person who opens an account. </p><p><b>Business transfers:</b> As we develop  our business, we may sell or buy 
businesses or assets, or be  involved in mergers  or other corporate 
reorganization. In transactions such as  these, your personal  information may 
be shared in connection with any of the  foregoing types of  transactions, even 
prior to the existence of a final,  binding agreement to buy,  sell, merge, or 
reorganize. </p><p><a href="#securitypolicy">Back to top</a></p></section><section class="category-examples"><span id="how-we-protect-the-confidentiality-and-security-of-your-personal-information"></span><h3>How we protect the confidentiality and security of your

Fraudsters have tried to steal billions of dollars from businesses, posing as company executives and ordering huge wire transfers. These scams can be in the form of emails, phone calls or texts. Many of the attempts are targeted to specific individuals or business functions (e.g., Payroll, HR, Accounting) and appear to be about everyday business processes. A common tactic is to convey a sense of urgency and/or secrecy. Often, the emails arrive late in the day, just before a holiday or weekend, or when the purported sender is out of the office. If you receive an email that appears suspicious, be sure to check the authenticity of the email prior to performing any wire transfers.

<br><br><b><u>Protecting yourself:</u></b><br><br>
Enable user authentication: Ensure your device is configured in a way that forces the use of "Passwords and Personal Identification Numbers (PINs)" to gain access. The password field should also be masked to prevent casual viewing. Consider activating idle-time screen locking. This will force the need to have proper credentials being granted access to your information.<br><br>
Enable auto-wipe feature after excessive password failures.</li><li><b><u>Risk: Near Field Communications (NFC) broadcast the presence of your mobile device.</u></b>  Mobile devices sometimes have NFC enabled to permit the exchange of information directly between two devices. This exchange of information between two devices can happen between you and a trusted friend or between you and a criminal, allowing them to capture the sensitive personal information stored on your device.  
<br><br><b><u>Protecting yourself:</u></b><br><br>
At a minimum, follow these simple instructions: (1) Read the fine print that comes with your NFC-enabled device and applications; (2) Ensure that you apply software updates to your device in a timely manner; and (3) When not using your NFC capability, be sure to turn it off.</li><li><b><u>Risk: Clicking on a banking link received in a text message or email:</u></b> Be suspicious of any URL links that you may receive from the bank sent via text message or email. Links received in this fashion can be very dangerous, redirecting you to malicious websites owned by cyber-criminals.
<br><br><b><u>Protecting yourself:</u></b><br><br>
Enter the bank's web address into your mobile device and bookmark the link. Then use this link instead of the one that was sent to you. Using this technique will prevent you from being tricked into going to fake websites. Also, be sure not to send sensitive or personal information such as account information or password in a text message or email.
<br><br><b>Important Tip:</b> Here are two ways to ensure validity of the links:
<ol><li>Hover your mouse over URL links to determine its validity prior to clicking on it. Or,</li><li>Copy the link into your browser; the part of the URL you don’t see will be copied and any potentially hidden malicious site URL will be revealed</li></ol><br><b>Important Note:</b> At times CIT will send out emails that include URL links to our company websites www.cit.com, www.bankoncit.com and www.onewestbank.com. The emails will come from donotreply@bankoncit.com or donotreply@owbmail.com.</li><li><b><u>Risk: Failure to delete all sensitive information from devices that are no longer in use.</u></b> Leaving the names of banks or credit unions, passwords, or other personal information on your device could result in identity theft.
<br><br><b><u>Protecting yourself:</u></b><br><br>
You must delete the data from your old phone before disposing or passing it on to another person. The easiest way to accomplish this is to wipe the device by performing a factory reset and then entering fake data to overwrite any traces of the original data. Follow the instructions provided by you device manufacturer to accomplish this process prior to disposing of the device.</li><li><b><u>Risk: Downloading applications from unofficial sites that contain malicious software.</u></b> It is not uncommon for consumers to inadvertently download applications that are disguised as useful programs, but in reality, contain malware that serves the intent of the cyber-criminal. 
<br><br><b><u>Protecting yourself:</u></b><br><br>
Be sure that your application is sanctioned by the bank prior to downloading and installing it.  Follow your device's software update procedures to verify the application's signature and to confirm the package is authentic and complete.<br><br>
Download mobile apps only from reputable sites:
<ul class="circle"><li>iOS: App Store</li><li>Android: Google play and Amazon App Store</li></ul>

For Android users, evaluate apps before installing. Look at the number of downloads, read customer reviews and look at the app's rating; if low, be suspicious as this means there has not been thorough vetting of the app (e.g., for security issues, functionality, etc.). Be aware of what permissions an app has access to (e.g., location, contacts, photos, camera, microphone); be suspicious of requests for excessive access (e.g., does a game app really need access to your contact list or the ability to send text messages?)</li><li><b><u>Risk:  Loss of Mobile device:</u></b>  Losing a mobile device can potentially result in divulging your sensitive information to thieves.
<br><br><b><u>Protecting yourself:</u></b><br><br>
Install tracing and remote deletion software will help you find the device's location in the event it is ever lost or stolen.  Also, if plausible, install software that permits you to perform remote deletion. You should also consider leveraging the device's locking capabilities depending on the device you will need to trace a pattern, or insert a Personal Identification Number (PIN) into your phone to enable the device locking feature. This added layer of security will slow a criminal down long enough for you to disable you bank account before any unauthorized access occurs.</li><li><b><u>Risk: Mobile devices without security software installed:</u></b> Mobile devices need to have security software to protect against malicious applications and spyware. At times, these devices do not come pre-installed with the appropriate security software or users fail to install the security software.
<br><br><b><u>Protecting yourself:</u></b><br><br>
Install Anti-Malware Capability: Users should ensure that appropriate software is installed and enabled on their mobile device to protect against unwanted email attachments, voice messages, and text messages as well as malicious applications, viruses, and spyware.</li><li><b><u>Risk: Out-of Date Operating System:</u></b>  Security patch updates on operating system and third party applications can sometime take weeks before these are provided to, and installed by users. Jailbreaking (iOS) and rooting (Android) provide the user with additional access to circumvent mobile device security controls. For certain mobile devices, rooting and jailbreaking allow the user to download applications from untrusted sources, which may introduce malware onto the device.
<br><br><b><u>Protecting yourself:</u></b><br><br>
Your mobile device can be configured to automatically update to the latest operating system version. Follow the instructions that come with your device so that you can ensure these updates are transmitted promptly. Avoid jailbreaking or rooting your mobile device.</li><li><b><u>Risk: No restrictions on Internet Connections.</u></b>    By not limiting the ports that can be used by a device, you may permit a potential criminal to enter the device through an unsecure access point.
<br><br><b><u>Protecting yourself:</u></b><br><br>
Install Anti-Malware Capability: Users can install a mobile personal firewall. When this software is installed appropriately, the programs will enable the mobile device to protect against unwanted email attachments, voice messages, and text messages; as well as, malicious applications, viruses, and spyware.</li><li><b><u>Risk: Connection to an Unsecured Wi-Fi Network.</u></b> Public network connections are notoriously not very secure. When using Wi-Fi networks, users become susceptible to the Man-in- the-Middle attacks (MITM) where criminals eavesdrop on the network connection. When this happens, users are at risk of their personal information being viewed and/or stolen. 
<br><br><b><u>Protecting yourself:</u></b><br><br>
Do not participate in banking activities while connected to a public network. It is better to disable Wi-Fi and switch to the cellular network when handling personal banking transactions or look into setting up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) that encrypts your Wi-Fi connections.</li></ol></dd><dt><a href="#" id="PhishingWebsiteScam"><span class="signal">expand +</span>Phishing Website Scam</a></dt><dd style="display: none;"><h3>Be aware of Phishing Website Scams</h3><p>OneWest Bank has created this webpage to inform and warn consumers about a type of fraud called "phishing." The term "phishing" - as in fishing for confidential information - refers to a scam that encompasses fraudulently obtaining and using an individual's personal or financial information. This is how it works:</p><ul class="circle"><li>A consumer receives an e-mail that appears to originate from a financial institution, government agency, or other well-known/reputable entity.</li><li>The message describes an urgent reason you must "verify" or "re-submit" personal or confidential information by clicking on a link embedded in the message.</li><li>The provided link appears to be the Web site of the financial institution, government agency or other well-known/reputable entity, but in "phishing" scams, the Web site belongs to the fraudster/scammer.</li><li>Once inside the fraudulent Web site, the consumer may be asked to provide Social Security numbers, account numbers, passwords or other information used to identify the consumer, such as the maiden name of the consumer's mother or the consumer's place of birth.</li><li>When the consumer provides the information, those perpetrating the fraud can begin to access consumer accounts or assume the person's identity.</li></ul><p>Recently, criminals have been using the OneWest Bank's name and reputation to perpetrate various "phishing" schemes.  It is important to note that OneWest Bank will never ask for personal or confidential information in this manner. One “phishing” scheme was perpetrated using the following domain name: www.onewstbk.com </p><p>Please do not attempt to transact any business or submit any personal information through the above web site.</p><p>Any genuine OneWest Bank communication will only utilize links to the official OneWest web page located at <a href="http://www.onewestbank.com">www.onewestbank.com</a> Any genuine link will commence with that URL as in the example below:</p><p><img title="Phishing Website Scam" alt="Phishing Website Scam" src="/images/business/footer-PhishingWebsiteScam.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);"></p><p>If you click on a link that takes you to a website whose address begins with something else, or which includes apparent abbreviations of our bank name, it’s not a genuine OneWest Bank site – even if it looks familiar.  You should refrain from using any links or information found at such fraudulent sites. Look for:</p><ul class="circle"><li>Anti-malware warning when trying to access a web page.</li><li>No lock icon in the address bar and/or URL does not start with https.</li><li>Observe the overall look and feel of the site - be cautious if there appears to be random content on the site or links that appear to access unrelated content (e.g., a bank site with links to pharmaceuticals).</li></ul><p>If you suspect an e-mail or Web site is fraudulent, please report this information to OneWest Bank, using this number 1.877.741.9378.  If you suspect that you have been a victim of identity theft, perhaps because you submitted personal information in response to a suspicious, unsolicited e-mail or you see unauthorized charges on your credit card, immediately contact OneWest Bank and, if necessary, close existing accounts and open new ones.  Also contact the police and request a copy of any police report or case number for later reference.  In addition, call the three major credit bureaus (Equifax at 800-525-6285, Experian at 888-397-3742 and TransUnion at 800-680-7289) to request that a fraud alert be placed on your credit report.</p></dd><dt><a href="#" id="shellshock"><span class="signal">expand +</span>Bash Shellshock Bug</a></dt><dd style="display: none;"><p><b>Your online security is always a priority to OneWest Bank.</b><br> Given the recent news of the Bash "Shellshock" bug, we want you to know what we're doing to protect your information.</p><p><b>First, what is the Bash Shellshock Bug?</b><br> The Shellshock bug refers to a coding flaw housed in utility program called "Bash," which affects computers and websites running operating systems such as Mac OS and Linux.  Bash enables computer programs to connect, and one of its chief uses is in connecting web server software to underlying operating systems.  It also enables individual computers to execute commands like "run my Web browser" and "open this application," etc.   Generically, programs like Bash are called "shells,"  and that's how the bug was given its name.</p><p>Bash has been in use all over the world for well over 20 years, but in September 2014, it was discovered that modifications to the code in the early 1990s inadvertently created a flaw that allows malicious code execution to take over an operating system and access confidential information.  As a result, lots of companies with an internet presence are potentially at risk from the Shellshock bug.  Certain personal computers may also be at risk.</p><p><b>What is OneWest Bank doing about it?</b><br> OneWest is using both automated and manual protocols to detect Bash vulnerabilities in our own systems and swiftly deploy the appropriate patches. We are also working with our vendors to detect and eliminate vulnerabilities.</p><p><b>What should I do?</b><br> There are two things you can do to protect yourself, and they are not new:</p><p>First, the best way to limit your exposure to computer bugs that target internet-based activity is to have different passwords for different websites, and to make those passwords appropriately complex, using upper- and lower-case letters, numbers and if allowed, symbols.  Change your passwords periodically.</p><p>Second, it's always wise to watch for and promptly implement operating system updates or patches designed to enhance security.  Bash is used in personal computers running the Mac operating system, though Apple has explained that OS X is safe for all but those running advanced Unix services.  A patch is coming for those users, according to Apple.  Bash is not native to Windows-based computers, but there is a window-based version in use on some machines, that is reportedly vulnerable.  So stay up to date on security patches for your machine(s)!</p><p><b>Why you can feel confident.</b><br> We're serious about security. Your online account with OneWest Bank is protected with a sophisticated information security program. Our multi-layered defense system consists of preventive, detective and response controls managed by a team dedicated to tracking threats such as the Shellshock bug.</p><p>We are vigilantly monitoring this situation and will take additional steps, as needed, to guard against the Shellshock bug and safeguard your information.</p></dd><dt><a href="#" id="phishingscam"><span class="signal">expand +</span>Voice Phishing Phone Call Scam</a></dt><dd style="display: none;"><p><b>Calls Claiming to Come from OneWest Bank’s Security Department:</b></p><p>Recently, some of our customers have received telephone calls featuring a recorded message that claims to be from OneWest Bank’s Security Department.

Often called "phishing" or "spoofing," the most current methods of online fraud are fake e-mails, websites and/or pop-up windows.</p><p><b>OneWest Bank will never send an unsolicited request for personal information through e-mail or require customers to send personal information to us via e-mail or pop-up windows.</b> Any unsolicited request for OneWest Bank account information you receive through e-mails, websites, or pop-up windows <b>should be considered fraudulent and reported to us immediately</b> via our <a title="Notify Us" href="#" class="gtAccordion" data-tab="securitypolicy" data-acc="notifyus">Notify Us</a> link.</p><h3>Fake e-mails will often:</h3><ul class="circle"><li><b>Ask you for personal information.</b> Fake e-mails often contain an overly-generic greeting and may claim that your information has been compromised, that your account has been frozen, or ask you to confirm the authenticity of your transactions.</li><li><b>Appear to be from a legitimate source.</b> While some e-mails are easy to identify as fraudulent, others may appear to be from a legitimate address and trusted online source. However, you should not rely on the name or address in the "From" field, as this is easily altered.</li><li><b>Contain fraudulent job offers.</b> Some fake e-mails appear to be from companies offering jobs. These are often work-at-home accounting positions which are actually schemes that victimize both the job applicant and other customers. Be sure to confirm that the job offer is from a known and trusted company.</li><li><b>Contain prizes or gift certificate offers.</b> Some fake e-mails promise a prize or gift certificate in exchange for completing a survey or answering questions. In order to collect the alleged prize or gift certificate you may be directed to provide your personal information. Just like with job offers, be sure to confirm that prize or gift certificate is being issued from a known and trusted company.</li><li><b>Link to counterfeit websites.</b> Fake e-mails may direct you to counterfeit websites carefully designed to look real, but which actually collect personal information for illegal use. Check the URL in your browser’s address bar to ensure you are visiting a legitimate website.</li><li><b>Link to real websites.</b> In addition to links to counterfeit websites, some fake e-mails also include links to legitimate websites as supplements to fraudulent e-mails in order to make them appear real.</li><li><b>Contain fraudulent phone numbers.</b> Fake e-mails often contain telephone numbers that are tied to the fraudsters. Never call a number featured on an e-mail you suspect is fraudulent, and be sure to cross-check any numbers you do call with companies you know and trust.</li><li><b>Contain real phone numbers.</b> Some of the telephone numbers listed in fake e-mails may be legitimate, connecting to actual companies. Just like with links to legitimate websites (above), fraudsters include real phone numbers in an effort to make the e-mail appear legitimate.</li></ul><h3>Example of a fake email:</h3><p><img title="Fake E-mail" alt="Fake E-mail" src="/images/business/footer-FakeEmail.gif"></p><h3>Trojan horses</h3><p>These fake e-mails may also contain a virus known as a "Trojan horse" that can record your keystrokes. The virus may live in an attachment or be accessed via a link in the e-mail.</p><p>Again, OneWest Bank customers should keep in mind that we do not request personal information via e-mail or send e-mail attachments. Never respond to e-mails, open attachments, or click on links from suspicious or unknown senders.</p><p>If you're not sure if an OneWest Bank e-mail is legitimate, report it to us via our <a title="Notify Us" href="#" class="gtAccordion" data-tab="securitypolicy" data-acc="notifyus">Notify Us</a> link without replying to the e-mail you received.</p><h3>How is my e-mail address obtained by online fraudsters?</h3><p>E-mail addresses can be obtained from publicly-available sources or through randomly-generated lists. Therefore, if you receive a fake e-mail that appears to be from OneWest Bank, this does not mean that your e-mail address, name or any other information has been taken from OneWest Bank's systems.</p><h3>Counterfeit websites</h3><p>Online thieves often direct you to fraudulent websites via e-mail and pop-up windows and try to collect your personal information. In many cases there is no easy way to determine that you are on a phony website because the URL will contain the name of the institution it is spoofing. However, if you type (or cut and paste) the URL into a new web browser window and it does not take you to a legitimate website, or you get an error message, it was probably counterfeit website.</p><p>Another way to detect a phony website is to consider how you arrived there. Generally, you were directed by a link in a fake e-mail requesting your account information. Again, OneWest Bank will not request personal information from customers via e-mail. Any unsolicited request should be considered fraudulent and reported immediately via our <a title="Notify Us" href="#" class="gtAccordion" data-tab="securitypolicy" data-acc="notifyus">Notify Us</a> link.</p><h3>How can I prevent online fraud?</h3><p>With a few simple steps, you can help protect your OneWest Bank accounts and personal information from fake e-mails and websites:</p><ul class="circle"><li>Delete suspicious e-mails without opening them. If you do open a suspicious e-mail, do not open any attachments or click on any links it may contain.</li><li>Never provide sensitive account or personal information in response to an e-mail. If you have entered personal information, notify OneWest Bank immediately via our <a title="Notify Us" href="#" class="gtAccordion" data-tab="securitypolicy" data-acc="notifyus">Notify Us</a> link.</li></ul><h3>Avoiding malware:</h3><ul class="circle"><li>Keep a “clean” machine: Set your security software, Internet browser, and operating system (like Windows or Mac operating systems) to update automatically. Ensure your Internet browser setting is set to detect unauthorized downloads.</li><li>Instead of clicking on a link in an e-mail, type the URL of the site you want directly into your Internet browser. Criminals send e-mails that may appear to be from known, trusted sources, but clicking them could download malware or send you to a spoofed site designed to steal your personal information.</li><li>Don’t open e-mail attachments unless you can confirm the sender and the content of the attachment.</li><li>Download and install software only from websites you know and trust.</li><li>StaySafeOnline.org and OnGuardOnline.gov contain user-friendly information on commonly used, free security software as well as safe computing best practices.</li></ul><h3>Detecting and removing malware:</h3><ul class="circle"><li>Update your security software, and then run it to scan your computer for viruses and spyware. Delete anything it identifies as a problem. You may have to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.</li><li>If your computer is covered by a warranty that offers free tech support, contact the manufacturer. Before you call, write down the model and serial number of your computer, the name of any software you've installed, and a short description of the problem.</li><li>Many companies – including some affiliated with retail stores – offer tech support on the phone, online, at their store, and in your home. Decide which is most convenient for you. Telephone and online help generally are the least expensive, but you may have to do some of the work yourself. Taking your computer to a store usually is less expensive than hiring a repair person to come into your home.</li><li>Once your computer is back up and running, think about how malware could have been downloaded to your machine, and what you could do differently to avoid it in the future.</li></ul></dd><dt><a href="#" id="phishingschemes"><span class="signal">expand +</span>Phishing Schemes</a></dt><dd style="display: none;"><p><b>Updated January 15, 2009</b></p><p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is warning consumers, businesses and financial institutions to be aware of fraudulent e-mails allegedly from the Federal Reserve Bank.

Do not follow Web links in unsolicited e-mails from apparent federal banking agencies. Instead, bookmark or type the agency's Web address. </li><li>Always use anti-virus software and ensure that the virus signatures are automatically updated. Ensure that the computer operating systems and common software applications security patches are installed. </li><li>Do not open unsolicited or unexpected e-mail attachments because of the risk of malicious code or software in the attachments. Instead, call the agency using a known and appropriate telephone number to verify the legitimacy of the message and attached file. </li><li>Be alert to different variations of the fraudulent e-mails. </li></ul><p>Information about counterfeit items, cyber-fraud incidents and other fraudulent activity may be forwarded to the FDIC's Cyber-Fraud and Financial Crimes Section, 550 17th Street, N.W., Room F-4004, Washington, D.C. 20429, or transmitted electronically to alert@fdic.gov.
