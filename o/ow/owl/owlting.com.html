          We will process your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. We collect and
          process
          information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so.
          <br>
          These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them, meaning we collect and use your
          information only
          where:<br><br>
          it’s necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your
          request before entering into such a contract (for example, when we provide a service you request from us);
          it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for
          research
          and development, to market and promote our services, and to protect our legal rights and interests;
          you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose (for example, you might consent to us sending you our
          newsletter);
          or
          we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.<br><br>
          Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change
          your mind at
          any time (but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place).<br><br>
          We don’t keep personal information for longer than is necessary. While we retain this information, we will
          protect it
          within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure,
          copying,
          use or modification. That said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure
          and
          cannot guarantee absolute data security. If necessary, we may retain your personal information for our
          compliance with
          a legal obligation or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural
          person.
