	<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
	<p class="grey">Last Updated: May 10, 2013</p>
	<p>
		This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is
		collected, used, and disclosed with respect to your use of our website
		located at <a href="https://www.owler.com">www.owler.com</a>
		(the "Site") and the software and services provided by Owler, Inc.
		("Owler", "we" or "us") and accessed through the Site and your
		mobile device (the "Owler Service") so you can make an informed
		decision about using the Owler Service. By using the Owler
		Service, you represent that you are 13 years old or older and consent
		to the privacy practices described in this Policy, as may be modified
		by us from time to time. We reserve the right to change the provisions
		of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been
		made by indicating on the top of the privacy policy the date it was
		last updated. Your use of the Site following the posting of such
		changes or revised statement shall constitute your consent to any
		changes in our privacy practices, and you expressly waive any right to
		notice of such changes. We encourage you to review this Policy
		whenever you visit our Site to make sure that you understand how any
		personal information you provide will be used.
	</p>
	<h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
	<p>When you visit the Site you may provide us with two types of
		information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose
		that is collected on an individual basis and use information collected
		on an aggregate basis as you and others browse the Site.</p>
	<h3>1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide</h3>
	<h4>Registration Information</h4>
	<p>
		You will provide us information about yourself when you register to be
		a user of <a href="https://www.owler.com">www.owler.com</a>,
		register for certain services, or register for email newsletters and
		alerts. We may combine information you provide with information from
		third party sources to improve your experience with our Site and
		Service.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can use the "My Account" section to learn more about the
		information associated with your account. You may also provide
		additional comments on how you see <a href="https://www.owler.com">www.owler.com</a>
		servicing your needs and interests.
	</p>
	<h4>Communication Information</h4>
	<p>If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain
		the content of your email messages together with your email address
		and our responses. If you choose to sign up for an email newsletter,
		we will send the newsletter to the email address you register with us.
		If you wish to unsubscribe from the newsletter, you may do so by using
		the unsubscribe link in the newsletter. If you choose to communicate
		via SMS through one of our services that offers SMS technology, we may
		retain the content of the message together with the phone number and
		wireless carrier, as well as the date and time the message was
		received or sent.</p>
	<h4>Location Data</h4>
	<p>If you use any mobile application in connection with the
		Owler Service, we may receive information about your actual
		location, or information that can be used to approximate your
		location, including GPS signals sent by your mobile device and your
		mobile identification.</p>
	<h3>2. Website Use Information</h3>
	<p>Similar to other commercial websites, the Site utilizes a
		standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are
		Cookies?") and Web server logs to collect information about how the
		Site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs
		may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent
		at our Site, and the websites visited just before and just after our
		Site. We, our advertisers and ad serving companies may also use small
		pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to determine which
		advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded
		to them.</p>
	<h4>What Are Cookies?</h4>
	<p>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an
		anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's
		computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a
		part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web
		site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's
		preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only
		permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you,
		not the cookies sent to you by other sites. You can configure your
		browser to notify you whenever a cookies is being sent, and to refuse
		all cookies. Please note that some features for the Owler Service
		may not function properly if cookies are disabled for your browser.</p>
	<h4>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</h4>
	<p>As you browse through our Site, the Site uses its cookies to
		differentiate you from other Owler users. In some cases, we also
		use cookies to prevent you from seeing unnecessary advertisements or
		requiring you to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies,
		in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate
		the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts
		of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order
		to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers.
		Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you
		and we do not generally store any personal information that you
		provided to us in your cookies.</p>
	<h4>Sharing Information with Third Parties</h4>
	<p>We may enter into alliances, partnerships or other business
		arrangements with third parties who may be given access to personal
		information including your name, address, telephone number and email
		for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and
		services that we think will be of interest to you. In connection with
		alliances, partnerships or arrangements, we may also provide certain
		information to third parties if we have determined that the
		information will be used in a responsible manner by a responsible
		third party. For example, some of our partners operate stores or
		provide services on our site, while others power offerings developed
		by us for your use. We may also use third parties to facilitate our
		business, including, but not limited to, sending email and processing
		credit card payments. In connection with these offerings and business
		operations, our partners and other third parties may have access to
		your personal information for use in connection with business
		activities. As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or
		business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is
		generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of
		transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of
		corporate divestitures, mergers, or any dissolution.</p>
	<h3>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</h3>
	<p>
		Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of
		administering and expanding our business activities, providing
		customer service and making available other products and services to
		our users and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the
		information we collect to notify you about important changes to our
		Site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable.
		You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these
		offers by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@owler.com">support@owler.com</a>.
	</p>
	<h3>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h3>
	<h4>How Do We Secure Information Transmissions?</h4>
	<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against
		unauthorized access to all of our data. This includes internal reviews
		of our data collection, storage and processing practices, as well as
		an assessment of our encryption and physical security measures to
		guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal
		data.</p>
	<p>We restrict access to personal information to a limited number
		of our employees, partners and agents. These individuals and entities
		are bound by confidentiality agreements and may be subject to
		discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they
		fail to meet any obligations required under their agreement with us.</p>
	<h4>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</h4>
	<p>When you use our Site, we make every effort to provide you with
		access to your personal information and will correct this data if it
		is inaccurate or delete it at your request if it is not otherwise
		required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We
		ask individual users to identify themselves and the information
		requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such
		requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably
		repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort,
		jeopardize the privacy of others, would be extremely impractical (for
		instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes),
		or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we
		provide information access and correction, we perform this service
		free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate
		effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you
		delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time
		before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our
		backup systems.</p>
	<h4>Certain Disclosures</h4>
	<p>We may disclose your personal information if required to do so
		by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to
		(a) conform to the law or comply with legal process served on us or
		Affiliated Parties; (b) protect and defend our rights and property,
		the Site, the users of the Site, and/or our Affiliated Parties; (c)
		act under circumstances to protect the safety of users of the Site,
		us, or third parties.</p>
	<h4>Enforcement</h4>
	<p>We regularly review our compliance with this Privacy Policy. To
		our knowledge, we comply with the CAN SPAM Act of 2003 and the US Safe
		Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer,
		Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement. We take all of your
		concerns seriously and will review any written complaints received by
		us. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities,
		including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints
		regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved
		between any of our members and us.</p>
	<h4>What About Other Websites Linked to Our Site?</h4>
	<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites
		linked to or from our Site nor the information or content contained
		therein. Often, links to other websites are provided solely as
		pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of
		our Site.</p>
	<p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Site to
		another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your
		browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites
		which have a link on our Site, is subject to that website's own rules
		and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before
		proceeding.</p>
	<h3>Transfer of Data</h3>
	<p>We process personal information on leased dedicated servers
		located in the United States of America and in other countries. In
		some cases, we process personal information outside your own country.
		If you use the Owler Service from outside the United States and
		provide personal information to us, your personal information may be
		transferred to the United States. If you use the Owler Service from
		within the United States and provide personal information to us, your
		personal information may be transferred out of the United States.
		Through your use of our Service, you consent to such transfer and to
		the use of the information between countries.</p>
	<h3>Your Consent</h3>
	<p>By using our Site you consent to our collection and use of your
		personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we change
		our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our
		Site to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it
		and under what circumstances we may disclose it.</p>
