			<b class="gen"><font size="4">Owen’s World Privacy Policy</font></b> <span class="gen"> 
<p>Owen’s World respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to every 
  area of our web sites. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect 
  through the site, how we use that information, and what choices you have. </p>
<p>This site contains links to other web sites. This Privacy Policy does not apply 
  to the practices of any companies or individuals that we do not control, or 
  any web sites that you link to from our site. You should use caution and review 
  the privacy policies of any sites that you visit from ours to learn more about 
  their information practices. </p>
<p>Please take a few moments to read this agreement. By accessing the our site, 
  you agree to accept the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and are 
  aware that our policies may evolve in the future as indicated below.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  What we collect:</strong></p>
<p>In various places on the our site, we collect “Personally Identifiable 
  Information,” such as your name, age, e-mail address, or other information 
  that can be used to contact you or identify you as an individual. For example, 
  we collect this information when you register for membership. From time to time 
  in the future we may offer additional features, services, and promotional opportunities 
  that would require you to submit Personally Identifiable Information to participate. 
</p>
<p>We also collect “Anonymous Information” such as your IP address, 
  the type of browser you use, the pages on our site that you have visited, and 
  the advertisements that you have clicked on. Your Personally Identifiable Information 
  is linked to your Anonymous Information.</p>
<p>Like many Internet sites, we also use “cookies” to collect information. 
  A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer and is stored 
  on your hard drive. When you visit our site the cookie identifies your computer 
  to us so that you do not have to re-register/login each time you visit. We may 
  also use cookies to measure the traffic to our site and the use of different 
  services and features of the site. Advertisers that appear on the Owen’s 
  World may place cookies on your computer and their use of the information stored 
  on those cookies is subject to their own privacy policies. You should visit 
  their sites to learn about their information practices. Advertisers or other 
  companies do not have access to Owen’s World cookies. </p>
<p>We do not intend that children will use our sites. We do not solicit or knowingly 
  collect information from children under 13 years old, nor will we accept registration 
  from them. </p>
<p><strong><br>
  How we use the information we collect:</strong></p>
<p>We use Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to communicate 
  with you, to customize advertising and content available on the Owen’s 
  World, to conduct research for internal purposes and to use such information 
  to improve our services and the site.</p>
<p>We use information that is not personally identifiable to determine how people 
  use our web site and its services. For example this data tells us information 
  including how often users click on our advertisements, which files are downloaded 
  most frequently, and which areas of our site are the most popular. Analyzing 
  this data allows us to improve the offerings on and performance of our site. 
  Using your IP address, we can also determine the general physical location of 
  a user and may at times use this information to better target advertising to 
  users.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>How we share information:</strong></p>
<p>Except as noted below, Owen’s World does not share your Personally Identifiable 
  Information with third parties unless you give us your permission.<br>
  When you see parts of our site with a prominent brand of another company, information 
  you supply (or authorize for use) in that part of the site will be shared with 
  the other company that is cooperating in providing the service. Please visit 
  that company’s site to learn more about their information practices.</p>
<p>We aggregate the Anonymous Information that we collect and exchange it with 
  advertisers and others who are interested in our services. </p>
<p>We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information when required by law or 
  under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to conform 
  to applicable law, comply with subpoenas, court orders or legal process served 
  on Owen’s World, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against 
  legal claims, and to protect the property or interests of Owen’s World, 
  its agents and employees, personal safety, or the public. Under such circumstances, 
  Owen’s World may be prohibited by law, court order or other legal process 
  from providing notice of the disclosure, and Owen’s World reserves the 
  right to not provide such notice in its sole discretion. If we become part of 
  another organization, including without limitation, by merger, change of control, 
  sale of assets, or other acquisition, the acquiring organization will obtain 
  and have access to the Personally Identifiable Information collected by Owen’s 
  World and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personally 
  Identifiable Information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we cease operation, 
  your information may be transferred to and used by another company that offers 
  similar or related products or services. While we cannot predict a great deal 
  about such an unlikely event, we would hope this could provide you continuity 
  of service.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  What choices you have:</strong></p>
<p>When you register for membership, you have the option of checking a box to 
  tell us that you do not want us to send you emails. You may also opt out of 
  an automatic logging process that associates your Personally Identifiable Information 
  with your recent page views. We will keep track of your decisions in our database. 
  <br>
  Even if you choose not to receive information from us, we reserve the right 
  to communicate with you on matters we consider especially important.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Making changes:</strong></p>
<p>You may review the Personally Identifiable Information we have on file by logging 
  in and going to the <a href="../board/ucp.php?i=main&amp;mode=front">user control 
  panel</a> and clicking on <a href="../board/ucp.php?i=profile&amp;mode=profile_info">Edit 
  Profile</a>. Once there, there you may modify information that is incorrect 
  and delete certain information from your profile. You can also change your permission 
  for us to send you e-mails.</p>
<p>To delete your Personally Identifiable Information, you must manually change 
  your data fields to null values. Otherwise, your data is retained indefinitely.<br>
  We may change this policy from time to time. While we will usually indicate 
  major changes by notice on our site, please check here from time to time to 
  see if there is a revised policy posted.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Publicly Posted Information:</strong></p>
<p>If you register as a member and make postings to chat rooms or forums, please 
  remember that anything you post is publicly available. The user name you have 
  chosen during the registration process is visible to all users of the site. 
  Your user page will also show certain statistics regarding your use of the Site, 
  such as the date you became a member, how long ago you last visited the site, 
  your answers to the I have questionnaire. Your user profile, and the information 
  you choose to include in your profile, will also be available to other users 
  of our chat rooms, forums and to visitors that access your personal user page. 
  Owen’s world does not control, and is not responsible for, the use of 
  any information or content that you have exposed to the public through your 
  use of our site. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Updates:</strong></p>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as our services change 
  and expand. If we update this Privacy Policy, we will notify you about significant 
  changes by sending a notice to the email address specified in your account or 
  by posting a notice of such changes on the site. Unless otherwise provided, 
  the revised terms will take effect on the date they are posted. Once such changes 
  become effective, your continued use of the site will signify your acceptance 
  of the new Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy 
  Policy, or any revised Privacy Policy, your sole and exclusive remedy is to 
  discontinue using the Site.</p>
