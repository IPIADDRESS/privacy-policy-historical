For example, each time you visit the Website or otherwise use the Services, we automatically collect your IP address, browser and device type, access times, the web page from which you came, the regions from which you navigate the web page, and the web page(s) you access (as applicable) (collectively referred to as “<u>traffic data</u>”). We may link this traffic data to your unique Hootsuite user ID to better understand your needs and the needs of users in the aggregate, diagnose problems, analyze trends, provide services, improve the features and usability of our Services, and better understand and market to our customers and website users.</p><p class="">Hootsuite also makes use of non-identifiable information gathered for statistical purposes to keep track of the number of visits to the Services and Website pages with a view to introducing improvements and improve usability of our Services. This also includes where Hootsuite tracks certain metrics such as clicks on URLs that have been shortened via use of the Ow.ly service. We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our Services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal experience. Your IP address and other relevant non-identifiable information may be used in order to trace any fraudulent or criminal activity or any activity in violation of the Terms.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc1_5_1" id="eztoc1_5_1"></a><h2 class="">Cookies and related technologies<a id="cookies"></a>&nbsp;</h2><p class="">Hootsuite uses tracking technology (“<u>cookies</u>”) on the Website, in the Applications, and in the Platforms, including mobile application identifiers and a unique Hootsuite user ID to help us recognize you across different Services. By visiting the Website or using the Services you agree to the use of cookies in your browser and HTML-based emails. Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a web site, in order to track use of the site and to improve your user experience.</p><a name="eztoc1_5_1_1" id="eztoc1_5_1_1"></a><h3 class="">Session Cookies&nbsp;</h3><p class="">The Services use “session cookies”, which improve your user experience by storing certain information from your current visit on your device, such as log-in information. These enable us to remember your log-in session so you can move easily within the Website or the Services. Without these cookies, we wouldn’t be able to provide the Services to you. These session cookies have limited functionalities and expirations, and you will be required to re-enter your Hootsuite log-in information after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents and related Personal Information.</p><a name="eztoc1_5_1_2" id="eztoc1_5_1_2"></a><h3 class="">Performance and Remarketing Cookies</h3><p class="">Partners who help us serve advertising on and off the Website and analytics companies may also put cookies on your device.

If you are a Logged-In User, Hootsuite may use your Hootsuite user ID in combination with Google Universal Analytics and Google Analytics to track and analyze the pages of the Services you visit. &nbsp;We do this only to better understand how you use the Services and the Website, with a view to offering improvements for all Hootsuite users; and to tailor our business and marketing activities accordingly, both generally and specifically to you. Google Analytics cookies do not provide Hootsuite with any Personal Information.</p><p class=""><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html" target="_blank" class="">Learn more about privacy at Google and to opt-out of this feature by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.</p><p class=""><i>ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><i>Google Display Advertising</i></p><p class="">Additionally, Hootsuite uses Google Analytics code that allows for certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features. Subject to change, the Google Display Advertising features Hootsuite currently uses are Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.</p><p class="">These features are used to advertise online; to allow third-party vendors, including Google, to show you advertising across the Internet; to allow Hootsuite and third-party vendors, including Google, to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to the Website and to report how ad impressions, uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the Website. Data from Google's interest-based advertising or third-party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests) is also combined with Google Analytics to better understand the needs of Hootsuite users and to improve the Services.</p><p class="">You may opt out of such display advertising at any time by visiting your <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_self" class="">Google Ads Settings page</a>&nbsp;or by installing and running the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_self" class="">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>&nbsp;.</p><p class="">Hootsuite uses other third-party performance and remarketing cookies, and further information on those third-party cookies can be obtained by <a href="mailto:legal@hootsuite.com" target="_self" class="">contacting us</a>.</p><p class="">Hootsuite may also use related technologies including web beacons, bugs, pixels, and software tokens in order to facilitate your use of the Services. Most notably, the Services use software tokens (stored securely on Hootsuite-controlled servers) in order to facilitate the logging in to and the functioning of both the Supported Platforms and Third-Party Apps.</p><p class="">Most computer and some mobile web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. The Network Advertising Initiative has also developed a tool that may help you understand which third parties have currently enabled cookies for your browser and opt-out of those cookies. Further information can be found at http://www. networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. Please note however that, by blocking or deleting cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Website, Applications, and/or Platforms. If you do not want to receive tracking pixels, you will need to disable HTML images in your email client, and that may affect your ability to view images in other emails that you receive.</p><a name="eztoc1_6_1" id="eztoc1_6_1"></a><h2 class="">When we may share Personal Information<a id="info-sharing"></a></h2><p class="">Except as provided in the next paragraphs and elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Hootsuite does not divulge any Personal Information gathered via the Services to third parties.</p><p class="">Notwithstanding anything in the Privacy Policy to the contrary, we may share any information we have collected about you or that you have submitted:</p><p class="">(1) when you explicitly consent to the disclosure of such information to a third party when connecting to a third-party service that asks you if you consent to such sharing;</p><p class="">(2) where we are legally required to do so, such as in response to court orders or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims or demands;</p><p class="">(3) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the rights, property, or personal safety of any person;</p><p class="">(4) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding situations that involve abuse of the Services infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of the Website infrastructure or the Services generally);</p><p class="">(5) to a parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with Hootsuite;</p><p class="">(6) if we are acquired by or merged with another entity (in which case we will require such entity to assume our obligations under this Privacy Policy or inform you that you are covered by a new privacy policy); and</p><p class="">(7) if this information is not private, is aggregated or is otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information and related public data (such as Tweets, likes, etc.) or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did so).</p><p class="">Subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, we may also disclose information to our affiliates, agents, contractors, and service providers in order to facilitate the functioning of the Services or to perform tasks that are integral to the Services, such as processing transactions, fulfilling requests for information, or providing support services or other tasks, from time to time. Information may also be transferred from Hootsuite to the third parties in control of the Supported Platforms, but only to the extent required in order for the Services to function properly.</p><a name="eztoc1_7_1" id="eztoc1_7_1"></a><h2 class="">Children<a id="children"></a></h2><p class="">Protecting the safety of children when they use the Internet is very important to us.&nbsp; Our Services should only be accessed by individuals of Minimum Age. “<u>Minimum Age</u>” may mean different ages in different countries, depending on where the individual accesses the services. For reference, “Minimum Age” shall mean (a) 14 years old for the United States, Canada, Germany, Spain, Australia, and South Korea; and (b) 13 years old for all other countries. However, if applicable law requires that you must be older than such ages in order for Hootsuite to lawfully provide the Services to you (including the collection, storage, and use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy), then the Minimum Age would be such older age. The Services are not designed nor intended for use by children or anyone else under the age of 13.</p><a name="eztoc1_8_1" id="eztoc1_8_1"></a><h2 class="">Security<a id="security"></a></h2><p class="">We use industry best practices to keep any information collected and/or transmitted to the Supported Platforms or Third-Party Apps secure. This includes the use of HTTPS with TLS (Transport Layer Security), which encrypts all transmitted data, and OAuth 2.0 protocols for authentication and data transfer to Supported Platforms and Third-Party Apps.</p><p class="">Certain Personal Information, most notably Hootsuite log-in details, is encrypted during transmission using TLS. Once validated within our system, passwords are deleted from our system. In addition, Hootsuite uses third-party vendors and hosting partners such as <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_self" class="">Amazon</a> to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services. These vendors have been selected for their high standards of both physical and technological security, including ISO and SSAE16 certifications.</p><p class="">When payments are processed via credit card, Hootsuite uses third-party vendors that are PCI-DSS Compliant. At no point does Hootsuite have access to your credit card information.</p><p class="">You should bear in mind that submission of information over the Internet is never entirely secure.&nbsp; We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Services whilst it is in transit over the Internet and any such submission is at your own risk, and this risk is specifically disclaimed in our Terms.</p><p class="">If you are a Logged-in User, it is advisable that you log out of your account at the end of every session and not leave a logged-in account unattended for any period of time, particularly if you use a shared computer or device.</p><a name="eztoc1_9_1" id="eztoc1_9_1"></a><h2 class="">Information storage and international transfers<a id="storage-transfers"></a></h2><p class="">Hootsuite aligns itself with the Safe Harbor privacy principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, storage, use, transfer and other processing of Personal Data transferred from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland to the United States. While Hootsuite itself is not certified by the US Department of Commerce, the information that you submit via the Services is hosted on secure servers by Amazon Web Services located in the United States that are certified under the Safe Harbor Scheme for transfers of Personal Information outside the European Economic Area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Safe Harbor is an EU-recognized program that provides a way for US businesses to demonstrate that they provide adequate protection for personal information transferred to it according to EU data protection standards. Further information on Safe Harbor is available from <a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank" class="">the US Department of Commerce's website</a>.</p><a name="eztoc1_10_1" id="eztoc1_10_1"></a><h2 class="">Email preferences<a id="email"></a></h2><p class="">Hootsuite uses email as the primary mode of communications with our users.

In several instances, the content published via Hootsuite will not be in Hootsuite’s custody or control, and any content that has been shared by you through any Supported Platform or Third-Party Apps via the Services may continue to be available to third parties and the public at large, as this content is now under the control of the operators of the Supported Platforms and/or the Third-Party Apps.</p><a name="eztoc1_12_1" id="eztoc1_12_1"></a><h2 class="">Contacting us<a id="contact"></a></h2><p class="">If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact:</p><p class=""><a href="mailto:legal@hootsuite.com" target="_blank" class="">Hootsuite Legal Services</a></p><p class="">or:</p><address>Hootsuite Legal Services<br>
