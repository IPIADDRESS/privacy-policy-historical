<h2>&nbsp;<br>2. General information and mandatory information</h2>
<h3>Data protection</h3>
<p>The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Hence, we handle your personal data as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.</p>

This Data Protection Declaration explains which data we collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It also explains how, and for which purpose the information is collected.</p>
<p>We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e. through email communications) may be prone to security gaps. It is not always possible to completely protect data against third party access.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;<br>Information about the responsible party (referred to as the “controller” in the GDPR)</h3>
<p>The data processing controller on this website is:</p>
<p>ownCloud GmbH<br>

<h3>&nbsp;<br>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
<p>A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent you have already given us.

This also applies to any profiling based on these provisions. To determine the legal basis, on which any processing of data is based, please consult this Data Protection Declaration. If you log an objection, we will no longer process your affected personal data, unless we are in a position to present compelling protection worthy grounds for the processing of your data, that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or if the purpose of the processing is the claiming, exercising or defense of legal entitlements (objection pursuant to Art.&nbsp;21 Sect.&nbsp;1 GDPR).</strong></p>
<p><strong>If your personal data is being processed in order to engage in direct advertising, you have the right to at any time object to the processing of your affected personal data for the purposes of such advertising.

<h2>&nbsp;<br>5. Newsletter and email marketing</h2>
<h3>Newsletter data</h3>

<p>Among other things, Marketo is a service that can be deployed to organize and analyze the sending of newsletters and marketing emails.

<p>With the assistance of the Marketo tool, we can analyze the performance of our newsletter and email campaigns. If you open an email that has been sent through the Marketo tool, a file that has been integrated into the email (a so-called web-beacon) connects to Marketo’s servers in the United States. As a result, it can be determined whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links the recipient possibly clicked on. Tracking email openings is not possible if you have disabled image display by default in your email program. Technical information is also recorded at that time (e.g. the time of access). The sole purpose of this information is the performance of statistical analyses of newsletter and email campaigns. The results of such analyses can be used to tailor future newsletters to the interests of their recipients more effectively.</p>
<p>If you do not want to permit an analysis by Marketo, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter or marketing emails. We provide a link for you to do this in every email message.</p>
<p>The data is processed based on your consent (Art.&nbsp;6 Sect.&nbsp;1 lit.&nbsp;a GDPR). You may revoke any consent you have given at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter or marketing emails. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data processing transactions that have taken place prior to your revocation.</p>

Once you cancel your subscription to the newsletter or marketing emails, the data shall be deleted from our servers as well as those of Marketo. This shall not affect data we have been archiving for other purposes.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;<br>7. Custom Services</h2>
<h3>Job Applications</h3>
<p>We offer website visitors the opportunity to submit job applications to us (e.g. via email, via postal services on by submitting the online job application form). Below, we will brief you on the scope, purpose and use of the personal data collected from you in conjunction with the application process. We assure you that the collection, processing and use of your data will occur in compliance with the applicable data privacy rights and all other statutory provisions and that your data will always be treated as strictly confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Scope and purpose of the collection of data</strong><br>
If you submit a job application to us, we will process any affiliated personal data (e.g. contact and communications data, application documents, notes taken during job interviews, etc.), if they are required to make a decision concerning the establishment or an employment relationship. The legal grounds for the aforementioned are § 26 Federal Data Protection Act (“BDSG-neu”) according to German Law (Negotiation of an Employment Relationship), Art.&nbsp;6 Sect.&nbsp;1 lit.&nbsp;b GDPR (General Contract Negotiations) and&nbsp;– provided you have given us your consent&nbsp;– Art.&nbsp;6 Sect.&nbsp;1 lit.&nbsp;a GDPR. You may revoke any consent given at any time. Within our company, your personal data will only be shared with individuals who are involved in the processing of your job application.</p>
<p>If your job application should result in your recruitment, the data you have submitted will be archived on the grounds of § 26 Federal Data Protection Act (“BDSG-neu”) and Art.&nbsp;6 Sect.&nbsp;1 lit.&nbsp;b GDPR for the purpose of implementing the employment relationship in our data processing system.</p>
<p><strong>Data Archiving Period</strong><br>
If we should not be able to offer you a position, if you refuse a job offer, retract your application, revoke your consent to the processing of your data or ask us to delete your data, we will store your transferred data, incl. any physically submitted application documents for a maximum of 6 months after the conclusion of the application process (retention period) to enable us to track the details of the application process in the event of disparities (Art.&nbsp;6 Sect.&nbsp;1 lit.&nbsp;f GDPR).</p>
<p>YOU HAVE THE OPTION TO OBJECT TO THIS STORAGE/RETENTION OF YOUR DATA IF YOU HAVE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS TO DO SO THAT OUTWEIGH OUR INTERESTS.</p>
<p>Once the retention period has expired, the data will be deleted, unless we are subject to any other statutory retention obligations or if any other legal grounds exist to continue to store the data. If it should be foreseeable that the retention of your data will be necessary after the retention period has expired (e.g. due to imminent or pending litigation), the data shall not be deleted until the data have become irrelevant. This shall be without prejudice to any other statutory retention periods.</p>
<h2 id="social-media">&nbsp;<br>8. Our social media appearances</h2>
<h3>Data processing through social networks</h3>
<p>We maintain publicly available profiles in social networks. The individual social networks we use can be found below.</p>
<p>Social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn etc. can generally analyze your user behavior comprehensively if you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g. like buttons or banner ads). When you visit our social media pages, numerous data protection-relevant processing operations are triggered. In detail:</p>
<p>If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social media page, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. Under certain circumstances, your personal data may also be recorded if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this case, this data is collected, for example, via cookies stored on your device or by recording your IP address.</p>
<p>Using the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user profiles in which their preferences and interests are stored. This way you can see interest-based advertising inside and outside of your social media presence. If you have an account with the social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on any device you are logged in to or have logged in to.</p>
<p>Please also note that we cannot retrace all processing operations on the social media portals. Depending on the provider, additional processing operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media portals. Details can be found in the terms of use and privacy policy of the respective social media portals.</p>
<p><strong>Legal basis</strong><br>
Our social media appearances should ensure the widest possible presence on the Internet. This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art.&nbsp;6 Sect.&nbsp;1 lit.&nbsp;f GDPR. The analysis processes initiated by the social networks may be based on divergent legal bases to be specified by the operators of the social networks (e.g. consent within the meaning of Art.&nbsp;6 Sect.&nbsp;1 lit.&nbsp;a GDPR).</p>
<p><strong>Responsibility and assertion of rights</strong><br>
If you visit one of our social media sites (e.g., Facebook), we, together with the operator of the social media platform, are responsible for the data processing operations triggered during this visit. You can in principle protect your rights (information, correction, deletion, limitation of processing, data portability and complaint) vis-à-vis us as well as vis-à-vis the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g. Facebook).</p>
<p>Please note that despite the shared responsibility with the social media portal operators, we do not have full influence on the data processing operations of the social media portals. Our options are determined by the company policy of the respective provider.</p>
<p><strong>Storage time</strong><br>
The data collected directly from us via the social media presence will be deleted from our systems as soon as the purpose for their storage lapses, you ask us to delete it, you revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses. Stored cookies remain on your device until you delete them. Mandatory statutory provisions&nbsp;– in particular, retention periods&nbsp;– remain unaffected.</p>
<p>We have no control over the storage duration of your data that are stored by the social network operators for their own purposes. For details, please contact the social network operators directly (e.g. in their privacy policy, see below).</p>
