</p>

<h3 style="font-size:18px" id="2">2. Essential information for data processing and security</h3>
<p>
	We process personal user data only in compliance with the relevant data privacy provisions and we adhere to the principle of data avoidance and minimisation. This means user data is only used when legally permitted or where consent is present, especially if the data processing is necessary in order to provide the requested Services, is requested by law or we may rely on a consent of a user. 
</p>
<p>

These data transfers are either rely on your consent or are legally permitted (and if the needed data protection standards are met) 
</p>

<h3 style="font-size:18px" id="3">3. Processing of personal data</h3>
<p>
	Personal data, in addition to the use expressly named in this privacy policy, is used for the following purposes, if permitted by statute or consent:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The provision, execution, maintenance or optimisation and protection our Services.</li>
	<li>Ensuring effective customer services and technical support.</li>

<p>
	We only transfer user data to third parties if it is necessary for accounting purposes (e.g. to a payment service provider) or for other purposes, when these are necessary for us to meet the contractual obligations towards users. As provided for by applicable provisions we are entitled to disclose and submit data for criminal prosecution and risk prevention purposes.
</p>
<p>
	Upon contacting us (e.g. by contact form or email), user information is saved for the purpose of processing the request and for the event that follow-up questions arise.
</p>

<h3 style="font-size:18px" id="4">4. Registration and termination</h3>
<p>
	Users essentially decide themselves which data they disclose about themselves and who can access it. 
</p>
<p>
	The following mandatory information is collected within the user registration process:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Desired Domain</li>
	<li>Email address</li>
	<li>Password (saved in encrypted form)</li>
</ul>
<p>	
	Beyond the aforementioned information, each user decides themselves whether to provide further information (e.g. contents on their particular websites).
</p>
<p>
	In the case of successful termination, it's up to users to secure their data before the end of the agreement. 
</p>

<h3 style="font-size:18px" id="5">5. Domain Registration</h3>

	Please note: In case of domain registrations we disclose certain personal data to registrars and registering organizations. Such data will be stored by the registering organizations and published in Whois databases, where they will be basically accessible to anyone. 
<p></p>

	As an example, when registering a ".de"-domain, currently the name and the address of the domain owner, the administrative and technical contact person and the zone manager, as well as phone and fax numbers and email addresses of the administrative and technical contact person and the zone manager will be disclosed to and stored by DENIC e.G. Name and address will be accessible via the Whois-query on the internet. For .com-, .net- and .org-domains, for example, also the phone and fax number as well as the email address of the administrative contact person will be disclosed and made accessible to anyone in the Whois-databases.
</p>

<h3 style="font-size:18px" id="6">6. Collecting access data (log files)</h3>

Names of websites accessed, the file, date and time they were accessed, quantity of data transferred, the report of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited site), IP address and the requesting provider are included in this access data.
</p>
<p>
	Without making reference to the user's person or any other profile creation, we use the protocol data in accordance with legal provisions to statistically assess data for the purpose of operating, safeguarding and optimising our Services. We reserve the right however to verify the protocol data at a later date if there is justified suspicion of illegal use based on specific indications.
</p>

<h3 style="font-size:18px" id="10">10. Facebook Social Plugins</h3>
<p>
	Our Services use social plugins ("plugins") provided by the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or if you live in the European Union, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Irland ("Facebook"). The plugins are identifiable by a Facebook logo (white letter f on blue background, the word "like" or a thumb up icon) or the notice "Facebook Social Plugin". For a full list of all social Plugins please see <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://developers.facebook.com/plugins" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://developers.facebook.com/plugins</a>.
</p>
<p>
	When you use a function of the Services that contain a social plugin, your device establishes a direct connection to Facebook's servers. Facebook directly transfers the plugin content to your device which embeds the latter into our Services, enabling Facebook to receive information about you having accessed the respective page of the Services. Thus we have no influence on the data gathered by the plugin and inform you according to our state of knowledge:
</p>
<p>
	The embedded plugins provide Facebook with the information that you have accessed the corresponding part of our Services.

If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking "Like", or entering a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your device directly to Facebook and stored by it. Even if you are not logged into Facebook, there is possibility that the plugins transfer your IP-address to Facebook.
