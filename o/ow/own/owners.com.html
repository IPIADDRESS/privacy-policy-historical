  <h1>Privacy Policy and Security Statement</h1>
  <p>Owners.com is dedicated to safeguarding your privacy online. The following explains 
  how your information will be treated as you make use of our products and services.
  </p>
  <h2>Your Information</h2>
  <p>Owners.com draws a distinction between information that is provided when registering 
  on the site and information that is provided when listing your property for sale on our Web site.
  </p>
  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
  <p>
  Personal information is defined as information entered when registering on our Web site. 
  Owners.com does not sell or distribute any of your individual personal information to 
  other companies or vendors. We will not release any of your personal information to 
  other users without your permission. We may use or provide partners with aggregate 
  information from the information provided by all users.
  </p>
  <h2>Listing Information</h2>
  <p>
  Listing information is defined as information that is provided when a user signs up to 
  list his/her property on our Web site. In order to provide the maximum exposure for 
  properties listed on our site, Owners.com has formed partnerships with many other listing 
  services on major Internet portals and other sites. These partners are provided with 
  your listing information so that your property can be viewed with some detail on our 
  partners' sites. "Active Until Sold" and "No Expiration" refers to your Owners.com listing. 
  Distribution to or on any premium partner site(s) through a paid feature or listing package 
  is limited to 6 months from the original purchase date, or until otherwise expressly stated.
  When your listing information is received by Owners.com, your listing contact information is 
  automatically transferred to our partners' sites on a daily basis. If you request address 
  specific products or services we will transfer your listing contact information as required 
  by vendors, unless you specify otherwise. All customers are provided with the option of 
  withholding the posting of any or all listing contact information.
  </p>
  <h2>Credit Card Information</h2>
  <p>
  Owners.com accepts credit card information to provide our customers with the convenience 
  of purchasing our products and services online. Credit card information is defined as any 
  information that appears on a page where a credit card number can be submitted. All credit 
  card information is protected by SSL encryption technology. Once submitted, we store only
	the information required to reference your original transaction (which cannot be used to process 
	another charge transaction), and do not store your credit card number or any other identifiable
	account information on file.
  </p>
  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>
  In order to enhance your visit with personalized services, Owners.com makes use of cookie 
  technology. A cookie is a small file that is assigned to a user when they register on a 
  Web site. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information, nor are they 
  shared with our partners and vendors. We use cookie technology to track the way in which 
  customers use the site so that we can provide them with content that caters to their needs. 
  We also use cookies to make your visit more convenient by saving your password so that you 
  do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.
  We may use third-party tracking services or third-party advertising services (such as 
  Google's advertising services) that use cookies and clear gifs (also known as "web beacons" 
  or "web bugs") to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site.  
  This helps us measure the utility of our website and the effectiveness of our marketing 
  campaigns. It also helps advertisers reach consumers with messages and offers that are 
  relevant to them. Users may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the
  http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.
  </p>
  <h2>IP Address</h2>
  <p>
  Internet protocol (IP) addresses are unique to each computer, and they are used to identify senders
	and receivers of information over the Internet. IP addresses may also be used to identify approximate
	locations (such as city and state) of the computer to which an IP address is assigned.	Owners.com
	uses your computer's IP address to administer our Web site and to report aggregate information
	to our advertisers.  Individual user information is not released. 	We may also lookup your IP
	address' approximate location to help personalize your experience by offering services or
	features specific to your area.
  </p>
  <h2>Contests and Surveys</h2>
  <p>
  Owners.com occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. 
  This information is only shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. Individual user 
  information is not released.
  </p>
  <h2>A Word About Security</h2>
  <p>
  At Owners.com, we are committed to maintaining a secure environment to store and receive 
  your personal information. As stated in the credit card information section, Owners.com 
  receives your credit card information using industry standard SSL encryption.
  </p>
  <p>
  All of the information transmitted to Owners.com is stored safely and securely behind 
  our firewall. A firewall is a buffer that isolates our network from the Internet.
  </p>
  <p>
  At Owners.com, we constantly monitor our Web security in order to protect your information. 
  Once your information is received at Owners.com, access to your information is limited. Each 
  employee is provided with a copy of this document so that they are aware of our privacy practices.
  </p>
  <p>
  Owners.com works closely with our partners to ensure your privacy, however we are not 
  responsible for the privacy policy or content of our partners' Web sites.
  </p>
  <p>
  Owners.com and its subsidiaries will not disclose any of your personal information, except 
  when we have your permission or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
  </p>
  <h2>Changing and Editing Your Information</h2>
  <p>
  You, as a user, can change or edit your personal information and listing information at any 
  time. This procedure is accomplished by choosing to edit your account information once logged 
  in on our Web site. If you have any difficulties with, or questions about the modification 
  of personal information or listing information, please contact <a href="mailto:help@owners.com">help@owners.com</a>.
  </p>

		Please note that our opt-out list limits only communications from Owners.com; if you also wish to deactivate your listing
		or restrict your contact information available to interested buyers, please be sure to manage that information separately
		within your listing account manager.
  </p>
