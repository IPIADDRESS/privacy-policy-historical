We may combine the information we collect with publicly available information and information we receive from our parent, affiliate or subsidiary companies, business partners and other third parties.  We may use that combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about products, services and events that may be of interest to you, for other promotional purposes, and for other purposes described in this section.<br>

<p></p>
<h4><a name="C3">Online Advertising</a></h4>
<p>On our websites, we may collect information about your online activities to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests.  You may see certain ads on this and other sites because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our advertising to users through demographic, behavioral and contextual means.  These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other methods.  The networks use this information to show you advertisements for Oway and our business partners that are tailored to your individual interests.  The information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the vendors’ advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you have viewed, and the actions you take on the sites.  This data collection and ad targeting take place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks.  This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.<br>
To direct our ad network vendors not to use your data to deliver targeted advertising to you, please contact us at <a href="#">privacy@Owaytrip.com</a>.
</p>
<h4><a name="C4">Information We Share</a></h4>

We also may share personal information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf.  These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.<br>
We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order), (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.  We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell, merge or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.  Following such a sale, merger or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.
</p>
<h4><a name="C5">Your Choices</a></h4>
We offer you certain choices about what information we collect from you, how we use and disclose the information, and how we communicate with you.
You may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us or object at any time on legitimate grounds to the processing of your personal information. We will apply your preferences going forward.
