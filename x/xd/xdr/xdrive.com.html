<a name="WHAT"></a> 
<h2 class="H2">What is Xdrive and why is my information needed?</h2>
<p class="textMain">Xdrive provides customers with online storage space which can 
  be used to store, share, access, and protect important files. Xdrive is web 
  based, and we require, at a minimum, a first name, last name, password, and 
  valid e-mail address. </p>
<h2 class="H2">What personal information does Xdrive collect from me?</h2>
<p class="textMain">Xdrive collects personal information upon registration. During 
  registration for a free account , Xdrive typically will ask for your name and 
  e-mail address. When upgrading to a premium paid account, Xdrive will ask for 
  your credit card information in order to provide you uninterrupted service. 
  Please note that the more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it 
  is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once registered, you 
  are part of the Xdrive community, a customer account is created, and you can 
  take full advantage of Xdrive's services.</p>
<p class="textMain">In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information 
  at other times, including immediately following the registration process, when 
  you enter a contest or promotion sponsored by Xdrive, and when you report a 
  problem with the service or with your account. If you contact Xdrive we will 
  keep a record of that correspondence. In addition, Xdrive occasionally asks 
  registered users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. A link 
  is included to this Privacy Policy wherever Xdrive collects personal information.</p>
<p class="textMain">Xdrive customers use our service to store files and folders 
  (data). Xdrive will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such 
  data except as outlined in the <a href="/terms.jsp">Terms of Service</a> or 
  as may be required by law.</p>
<h2 class="H2">What are cookies and how does Xdrive use them?</h2>
<p class="textMain">In order to provide a personalized service, Xdrive uses cookies 
  to store some information about your account. A cookie is a small amount of 
  data that is sent to your browser from a web server that is stored on your computer's 
  hard drive. Xdrive uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. These 
  cookies are not tied to your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p class="textMain">Generally, we use cookies:</p>
<ul class="n">
  <li class="textMain">To establish an authenticated session with the service 
    when you login to your Xdrive account using our web interface. When you use 
    Xdrive's web interface to access your account, logging in will require that 
    you accept a session ID cookie. When you close your web browser, the session 
    ID cookie will terminate.</li>
  <li class="textMain">To remember some of your basic account preferences in order 
    to deliver a better, more personalized service. A persistent cookie may be 
    set when you register, "Sign In," or use the Xdrive web interface 
    to record certain application settings and other preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p class="textMain">Xdrive may also record your IP address for system administration, 
  monitoring, and fraud prevention purposes. IP Addresses are not linked or cross-referenced 
  with any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p class="textMain">This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Xdrive only 
  and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. Some of our business 
  partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or 
  control over these cookies.</p>
<a name="USE"></a> 
<h2 class="H2">How does Xdrive use my information?</h2>
<p class="textMain">Xdrive does not provide any of your personal information to 
  third parties except as outlined in this privacy policy. We do not sell or give 
  access to our customer e-mail list or other customer profile information to 
  anyone except as outlined.</p>
<p class="textMain">Xdrive does research on customer demographics and behavior 
  based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, 
  or from surveys. This information is tracked using log files, tracking pixels 
  and database history tables. We do this to better understand and serve our customers. 
  This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.</p>
<a name="COLLECT"></a> 
<h2 class="H2">Who is collecting information?</h2>
<p class="textMain">When you access Xdrive and are asked for personal information, 
  you are sharing that information with Xdrive alone. We also make use of the 
  Omniture service (<a href="http://www.omniture.com/" target="_blank">http://www.omniture.com</a>) 
  to provide basic reporting on web site visitors and usage patterns. Omniture 
  does NOT capture any information that can personally identify any of Xdrive's 
  customers or visitors. Omniture is compliant with the Platform for Privacy Preferences 
  Project (P3P), as developed by the World Wide Web Consortium.</p>
<a name="SHARE"></a> 
<h2 class="H2">With whom does Xdrive share my information?</h2>
<p class="textMain"> Xdrive will not disclose any of your personal information except 
  when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we 
  believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described 
  below. Please see our <a href="/terms.jsp">Terms of Service</a> 
  for more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared. 
  The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed.</p>
<ul class="n mB10">
  <li class="textMain"><b> Data in the Aggregate</b>: Xdrive may disclose aggregated 
    statistics (for example, 45% of our users are female) in order to describe 
    our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, 
    and for other lawful purposes.</li>
  <li class="textMain"><b>Special Circumstances:</b> Xdrive may also disclose 
    account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing 
    this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against 
    someone who may be violating Xdrive's <a href="/terms.jsp">Terms of Service</a> 
    or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or 
    unintentionally) Xdrive's rights or property, other Xdrive users, or anyone 
    else that could be harmed by such activities. Xdrive may disclose or access 
    account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</li>
  <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> When you sign up for an Xdrive premium 
    paid service, we will encrypt the data and pass relevant information to a 
    third party credit card processing company. These companies do not retain, 
    share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Third Party Retail Distributors: </strong>Should you signup for 
    Xdrive through one of our third party retail distributors, Xdrive may disclose 
    your email address to that specific third party retail distributor.</li>
</ul>
<a name="CHOICE"></a> 
<h2 class="H2">What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution 
  of my information?</h2>
<p class="textMain">Xdrive may, from time to time, e-mail you regarding our products 
  and services. Only Xdrive or agents working under confidentiality agreements 
  on behalf of Xdrive will send you such e-mail. Customers who do not wish to 
  receive these announcements may opt-out of receiving these communications by 
  sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@xdrive.com">unsubscribe@xdrive.com</a>. 
  All announcements sent by Xdrive also include unsubscribe instructions.</p>
<p class="textMain">You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying 
  your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified 
  when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all 
  cookies you will be unable to access your Xdrive via the web interface.</p>
<p class="textMain">Xdrive does not sell or provide access to customer information 
  to anyone, unless you happen to sign up for an account through a third-party 
  affiliate, in which case that affiliate also has your e-mail address. If there 
  is any other exception to this policy, we will notify you at the time of data 
  collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you 
  will always have the option of not permitting the transfer.</p>
<a name="UPDATE"></a> 
<h2 class="H2">What is Xdrive's policy on allowing me to update, correct, or delete 
  my personal information?</h2>
<p class="textMain">You can edit your Xdrive account information at any time by 
  accessing your account using our web interface (your profile information can 
  be modified by accessing the "My Profile" page once you are logged 
  in). If you have forgotten your password, please visit our <a href="/support/">Customer 
  Support Center</a> to request a new one.</p>
<p class="textMain">Your Xdrive account can be easily deleted or deactivated at 
  anytime. Doing so will result in losing access to most functions and services 
  provided by Xdrive, including your Xdrive account and any files stored in it. 
  Please visit our <a href="/support/">Customer Support Center</a> 
  for instructions about deleting or deactivating your Xdrive account. Residual 
  account information remains archived within our records.</p>
<a name="PROTECT"></a>
<h2 class="H2">What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, 
  or alteration of my information?</h2>
<p class="textMain">When you register for an Xdrive account, the signup page may 
  ask you for sensitive information (such as your credit card number). Information 
  collected when you register is encrypted and is protected with industry standard 
  SSL encryption. While on a secure page, such as our signup page, the padlock 
  icon on the bottom of most Web browsers becomes locked.</p>
<p class="textMain">Your Xdrive account information and Xdrive customer profile 
  are password-protected so that you, and only you, have access to this personal 
  information. You may edit your Xdrive account information by logging into our 
  web interface using your Xdrive username and password.</p>
<p class="textMain">We require that you do not divulge your password to anyone. 
  Xdrive will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or 
  e-mail. Also remember to sign out of your Xdrive account and close your browser 
  window when you finish your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access 
  your personal information or files if you share a computer with someone else 
  or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.</p>
<p class="textMain">As a global company, Xdrive has international sites and users 
  all over the world. When you give Xdrive personal information, that information 
  may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country where you originally 
  entered the information, such as to the United States or other countries. In 
  addition, that information may be used, stored and processed outside of the 
  country where you entered it. Whenever Xdrive handles personal information as 
  described above, regardless of where it occurs, Xdrive takes steps to ensure 
  that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant 
  <a href="/terms.jsp">Terms of Service</a> and this Privacy 
  Policy.</p>
<p class="textMain">Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can 
  be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your 
  personal information, Xdrive cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information 
  you transmit to us or while using the service, and you do so at your own risk. 
  Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security 
  on our systems.</p>
<a name="SHARING"></a>  
<h2 class="H2">What does Xdrive do with contact information that I might provide 
  when sharing files or folders?</h2>
<p class="textMain">When you use Xdrive to "Send a File" or "Share 
  a Folder" with someone, you normally enter that person's e-mail address 
  into the system so that a message can be sent informing him or her of the share. 
  Xdrive treats any contact information that you enter while using the service 
  with the same respect and confidentiality as your own information. E-mail addresses 
  that you enter when using Xdrive to share information are not sold or made available 
  to any 3rd parties.</p>
<p class="textMain">When you use Xdrive's "Send a File" feature, you 
  can elect to have the system send a notification message on your behalf by entering 
  the e-mail address(es) of the person(s) with whom you want to share the file. 
  If you prefer, you can instead generate a web link to the file, which can be 
  sent as part of your own message. Send a File notification messages sent by 
  Xdrive are one-time only messages with the sole intent of notifying the recipient 
  of the shared file.</p>
<p class="textMain">Using Xdrive's "Share a Folder" feature requires 
  that the person you are sharing with have an Xdrive account to access the folder. 
  If the person you are sharing with does not already have an Xdrive account, 
  a free sharing account will be created for that person when you share the folder. 
  Xdrive will automatically send an e-mail inviting the person to activate their 
  free account so they can access the folder you have shared. To activate, the 
  sharing account holder need only enter their first and last name (which is used 
  strictly for Customer Support purposes and to personalize the Xdrive experience) 
  and choose a password. The same Privacy Policy in effect for paying subscribers 
  also applies to Xdrive Free accounts, except that ads may be served to free 
  accounts.</p>
<h2 class="H2">What else should I know about my privacy?</h2>
<p class="textMain">Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal 
  information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat 
  areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you 
  post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive 
  unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</p>
<p class="textMain">This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware

  statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable 
  information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected 
  by this web site.</p>
<p class="textMain">Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy 
  of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible
