<p>Xdrive Technologies, Inc. has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on our website (the "Site") is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this Statement and will provide notification of the change prior to the change taking effect. 
</p>
<p><b>Collected Information</b><br>
We require customers who register to use the services ("Services") offered on our Site to give us contact information, such as their name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number and expiration date. 
</p>

<p>Xdrive uses the information that we collect to set up Services for our customers. We may also use the information to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company and the Services that we provide. Separately, customers are also asked to provide an email address when registering for the Service, in order to receive a username and password. We may also email information regarding updates to the Service. 
</p>
<p>Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, as stated herein, or as provided for in the Xdrive Terms of Use, we do not disclose to any third party the information provided. All billing information that we collect through the Site is used solely to bill for Services. This billing information is not used by Xdrive for marketing or promotional purposes. Xdrive uses a third party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing. 
</p>
<p>Customers of the Service will be using the Site to host data and information ("Data"). Xdrive will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as provided in the Xdrive Terms of Use, or as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the Terms of Use, or as may be required by law. Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password. 
</p>

<p><b>Cookies</b><br>
Cookies are files that your web browser places on your computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether you have visited the Services previously. Xdrive uses a persistent cookie to help save and retrieve usernames used on the Service. Xdrive issues a session cookie only to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session. The session cookie does not include either the username or password of the user.
</p>

<p><b>Log Files</b><br>
Our log files capture the URLs of the pages visited, browser type, screen resolution, and IP addresses for the purpose of analyzing trends, tracking user movement, administering the site, and gathering broad demographic information for aggregate use. None of this information is linked to personally identifiable. 
</p>

<p><b>Sharing of Information</b><br>
We will share aggregated demographic information about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors including our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. Examples include reports on how many times a certain page was viewed, or how many distinct users used the service. Xdrive will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information to any third party except (a) when such information is transferred to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Xdrive's business interests, or (b) when we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or (iii) protect the rights, property, or safety of Xdrive, our users, or others.
</p>

When you click on links and/or ad banners that take you to third-party web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies. While we support the protection of privacy on the Internet, Xdrive cannot be responsible for the actions of third parties or for their privacy practices. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website with which they interact.
