<p class="bodyText"><b>What personal information does Xdrive collect from me?</b><br>
</p><p class="bodyText">Xdrive collects personal information when you register, including your first name, last name, password, and valid user ID or screen name.

Once registered, you are part of the Xdrive community, a customer account is created, and you can take full advantage of Xdrive's services.</p>
<p class="bodyText">After you register, we may ask you for additional personal information from time to time, such as when you respond to a survey or request for information about your preferences, enter a contest or promotion sponsored by Xdrive, and when you report a problem with the service or with your account.  If you contact Xdrive we  keep a record of that interaction, including any email you send. A link is included to this Privacy Policy wherever Xdrive collects personal information.</p>
<a name="COOKIE"></a>

  <li class="menuItem"><span class="grayText"> 	To remember some of your basic account preferences in order to deliver a better, more personalized service. A persistent cookie may be set when you register, "Sign In," or use the Xdrive web interface to record certain application settings and other preferences. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="bodyText">You have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies.

<a name="SHARE"></a>
<p class="bodyText"><b>With whom does Xdrive share my information?</b><br>
</p><p class="bodyText">Xdrive will not disclose any of your Xdrive personal information except when we have your permission; in response to legal process or under the circumstances described below.

The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed.</p>
 <ul class="subMenu">

  <li class="menuItem"><b>Special Circumstances:</b> Xdrive may also grant access to or disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Xdrive's Terms of Service or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Xdrive's rights or property, other Xdrive users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Xdrive may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</li><br>
  <li class="menuItem"><b>Service Providers:</b> When you sign up for an Xdrive premium paid service, we will pass relevant information to a third party credit card processing company.  The credit card account number is encrypted for added security during these transmissions.  We prohibit these companies from retaining, sharing, storing or using this personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

For example, AOL LLC processes several types of e-mail for Xdrive, including but not limited to welcome, cancellation and share e-mails.  To facilitate these operations, Xdrive provides AOL LLC with your e-mail address information.<p></p>
<br>For AOL Members using Xdrive, certain AOL offerings may require interactivity with Xdrive services, and your Xdrive personal information may be shared with AOL in connection with such offerings.<p></p></li><br>
  <li class="menuItem"><b>Third Party Retail Distributors:</b> If you register for Xdrive through one of our third party retail distributors, Xdrive may disclose your email address to that specific third party retail distributor.</li>
 </ul><br>
<a name="UPDATE"></a>
<p class="bodyText"><b>What is Xdrive's policy on allowing me to update, correct, or delete
  my personal information?</b><br>
</p><p class="bodyText">You can edit your Xdrive account information at any time by accessing your account using our web interface. Your profile information can be modified by accessing the "My Profile" page once you are logged in.  Information associated with your screen name, if applicable, must be modified within the Screen Name Service (SNS).</p>
<a name="PROTECT"></a>
<p class="bodyText"><b>What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse,
  or alteration of my information?</b><br>
</p><p class="bodyText">When you register for an Xdrive account, the signup page may ask you for sensitive information (such as your credit card number. We use industry-standard SSL encryption to help protect the registration information you provide.</p>
<p class="bodyText">Your Xdrive account information and Xdrive customer profile are password-protected to help ensure that you, and only you, have access to this personal information.  You may edit your Xdrive account information by logging into our web interface using your Xdrive username and password.</p>
<p class="bodyText">We require that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Xdrive will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail.  Also remember to sign out of your Xdrive account and close your browser window when you finish your work to help ensure that others cannot access your personal information or files if you share a computer with someone or use a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.</p>
<p class="bodyText">As a global company, Xdrive has international sites and users all over the world.  When you give Xdrive personal information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country where you originally entered the information, such as to the United States or other countries. In addition, that information may be used, stored and processed outside of the country where you entered it.</p>
<p class="bodyText">Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Xdrive cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or while using the service, and you do so at your own risk.  We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical safeguards designed to help protect personal information stored in our systems.</p>
<a name="SHARING"></a>
<p class="bodyText"><b>How Xdrive uses contact information that you might provide when "Sending a File" or "Sharing a Folder"</b><br>
</p><p class="bodyText">When you use Xdrive to "Send a File" or "Share a Folder" with someone, you normally enter the intended recipientÂ’s e-mail address into the system so that a message can be sent informing him or her of the share. .  We do not sell or make those E-mail addresses available to any 3rd parties.</p>
<p class="bodyText">When you use Xdrive's "Send a File" feature, you can elect to have the system send a notification message on your behalf by entering the e-mail address(es) of the person(s) with whom you want to share the file. If you prefer, you can instead generate a web link to the file, which can be sent as part of your own message. Send a File notification messages sent by Xdrive are one-time only messages with the sole intent of notifying the recipient of the shared file.</p>
<p class="bodyText">Using Xdrive's "Share a Folder" feature requires that the person with whom you are sharing to have an Xdrive account to access the folder. If the person with whom you are sharing does not already have an Xdrive account, a free sharing account will be created for that person when you share the folder. Xdrive will automatically send an e-mail inviting the person to activate their free account so they can access the folder you have shared. To activate, the sharing account holder will need to register for the service and will need to provide standard information to do so.</p>
<a name="ELSE"></a>
<p class="bodyText"><b>What else should I know about my privacy?</b><br>
</p><p class="bodyText">Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others.  Xdrive does not control and is not responsible for how others use that information.</p>
<p class="bodyText">This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Xdrive is not responsible for the privacy or other practices of other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.</p>
<p class="bodyText">Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information.  Please be careful and responsible online.</p>
