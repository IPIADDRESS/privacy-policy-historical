Whilst your individual information is protected as outlined in this Privacy Policy, we reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group whether this is in connection with either web or text users. For example, we might report to potential advertisers that a certain percentage of our users are interested in its products, based on information requests.&nbsp; In addition, we may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. </p><p>4.6&nbsp;In the future, we may sell our business or assets. Personal information is usually considered an asset in such transactions. We may disclose, transfer, sell, assign or licence information described in this Privacy Policy, including personally identifiable information, to third parties as a result of or in preparation for the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganisation or liquidation of GCap and you consent to such disclosure, transfer, sale, assignment or licence. </p><p><strong>5.&nbsp;Registration</strong></p><p>5.1&nbsp;Where you have registered to access certain parts of our websites you will have chosen a password which enables you to access a restricted part of a website.&nbsp; You are responsible for keeping your password confidential and you should not share this with anyone.&nbsp; You are responsible for all use and communications with our websites which take place using your registration or password. </p><p><strong>6.&nbsp;Cookies</strong></p><p>6.1&nbsp;You may have read about "cookies".&nbsp; These are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. GCap uses cookies to identify registered users without needing to ask for registration details every time you access one of our websites. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information.&nbsp; Occasionally, we may use cookies to track browsing actions or monitor usage patterns on our site.&nbsp; This helps us administer our websites.&nbsp; In particular, we may track users as they travel through our websites - for instance, cookies may be used to count the total number of unique users who are accessing our websites over a particular period of time. This information will not be shared with a third party at an individual level, and is used to make our systems more efficient. In addition, cookies can control the display of ads, to ensure that you do not see the same ad too many times in a single session. You may also notice that our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies, either directly or when you link to their sites. We cannot directly control what our advertisers or these cookies do.</p><p>6.2&nbsp;If you are concerned about cookies, you can turn them off or refuse to accept cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. However, please note that if you do this some areas of our websites may not work properly. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will not accept cookies, our website will issue cookies when you log on to the site.</p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;Transfer of personal information outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”)</strong></p><p>For the reasons set out in this Privacy Policy and for technical and operational reasons, your personal information may from time to time, on our behalf, be transferred, processed or stored on servers based outside of the EEA.&nbsp; You should be aware that such countries outside of the EEA may not offer the same level of protection for your data.&nbsp; For example, your data may be processed to allow personalised radio streaming, to process your entry into a competition, to fulfil any order you make for goods or services, to process any payment details or to provide support services. By submitting data to us you consent to such transfer, storing and processing outside the EEA.&nbsp; We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including steps to help ensure that contractors operating on our behalf are subject to our standard technical and security obligations to provide an adequate level of protection for your information.&nbsp; </p><p><br><strong>8.&nbsp;Security</strong></p><p>8.1&nbsp;We use up to date industry procedures and technology to keep personal data as safe and secure as possible and to protect against loss, unauthorised disclosure or access. GCap and our associated companies follow the relevant legal requirements and use all reasonable precautions to ensure only responsible third parties see the information. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or any actions of any third parties who receive the information.&nbsp; </p><p>8.2&nbsp;Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.&nbsp; Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.&nbsp; Once we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p><p><strong>9.&nbsp;The Data Protection Act and the Information Commissioner</strong></p><p>9.1&nbsp;In the UK, the Data Protection Act provides a framework for the safety and security of personal data and the uses to which such personal data is put. The Information Commissioner is the UK’s independent public body set up to protect personal information and provide information to individuals and organisations.&nbsp; Please see <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk">www.ico.gov.uk</a> for more information. </p><p>9.2&nbsp;We are registered with the Information Commissioner as a ‘data controller’ under registration number Z8410660. We will ensure that all personal information supplied by you to us is held and dealt with in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and its relevant subordinate legislation and we will comply with the principles set out in that Act. When you supply any personal information to us we will meet our legal obligations towards you in the way that we deal with that information. In accordance with the data protection principles we must collect personal information fairly and let you know how we will use it and whether we will pass the information on to anyone else. For the avoidance of doubt, we will not supply your personal information to third parties without your express prior consent other than as set out in this Privacy Policy. We will ensure that any information will be held only as long as is necessary to ensure that our service runs smoothly. </p><p>9.3&nbsp;The Data Protection Act gives you the right to access information held about you.&nbsp; Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act.&nbsp; Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.</p><p><strong>10.&nbsp;Updating your information</strong></p><p>10.1&nbsp;If you are registered with us, you may update your personal information at any time via the "My Details" page for web users. You can get to the "My Details Page" or equivalent from most pages on our websites if you are logged-on.&nbsp; If you are a text user then the text messages you receive from us will alert you to options for unsubscription and/ or change of details - please follow these messages. In addition if you believe the information we hold about you to be out of date or inaccurate please <a href="http://xfm.co.uk/contactus.asp" target="_self">email us</a> or contact us at: Xfm, 30 Leicester Square, London, WC2H 7LA..</p><p><strong>11.&nbsp;Parents</strong></p><p>11.1&nbsp;GCap is committed to the safety and privacy of children who visit and participate in our services.

This could include your name, email address, home address, telephone number, your school or any other information about yourself that would enable someone to contact you either online or offline.</p><p>12.2&nbsp;From time to time we run online competitions that you may be able to enter. Always remember to ask your parent or guardian for permission before entering any competition.</p>
