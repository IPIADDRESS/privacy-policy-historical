	<p>Xfire, the company that brings you Xfire, takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.</p>
	<p><b>Xfire's Privacy Policy with respect to the Xfire Service:</b></p>
	
	<p><span class="p_storytitle">Information Collection &amp; Use</span><br>
	Xfire requires users to register for the Xfire service and provide personal information including a username and email address. Xfire uses this information to establish and deliver service to the individual. Xfire may use this information to contact registered users to notify them of product and service updates, provide instruction, and to deliver other service related information. Xfire may also contact users to request additional information and feedback. If you wish to be removed from such secondary mailings you may do so by the means provided in the email.</p>
	<p>Xfire may employ companies and people to perform tasks on its behalf, and will need to share personal information with these agents to establish and deliver service to the individual. Xfire's agents do not receive any right to use personal information beyond what is necessary to perform these tasks. Xfire will not disclose registration information to third parties, including, but not limited to, companies affiliated with Xfire, without your consent or as otherwise stated in this privacy policy.</p>
	<p>If at some point Xfire sells all or a portion of its assets, customer information is one of those assets that would be transferred or acquired by a third party; the third party would then have the right to continue using the personal information as set forth in this policy. For more information see our Privacy Policy Changes section below.</p>
	<p>Xfire may release or exchange personal information if required to do so to comply with applicable law or to enforce its rights or agreements or prevent fraud or reduce credit risk. In addition, Xfire may contact you to inform you of updates or new features.</p>
	<p>Registered users will be using the service to host personal and relationship data. Personal data includes personal information entered by the user such as name, contact information, and general and personal information related to their gaming life. Personal data also includes information automatically collected by the Xfire client related to the use of Xfire service. Information collected includes but is not limited to frequency of game play and type and time of games played. Relationship data includes lists of friends added to the service by the user and other data collected by the service including who users play with most frequently. This information is logged to provide the primary service of Xfire: helping gamers play with their friends more easily.</p>
	<p>This logged information is also used to filter messages to Xfire users so that the messages Xfire sends its users are the most relevant. These messages are only seen by the users themselves and are not shared with 3rd parties. Nonetheless, users have full control over which other Xfire users have access to personal data and the degree of personalization that can be delivered via the client.</p>
	<p>Xfire also collects, tracks and analyzes information that does not personally identify a user but rather is used in an aggregate form. This aggregate data will be used at Xfire's discretion and may be shared with third parties, but with no personally identifiable information attached. Xfire will not review, share, distribute or reference such data except as may be required to provide the requested Xfire services, or as provided in the Xfire Terms of Use Agreement, or as may be required by law.</p>
	<p>If a user elects to use our invite a friend feature via the Xfire site we will automatically send this person an email. We will send an email to invite them to visit the site, download the client and add the user as a friend. If the friend does not respond we do not send any reminder emails.</p>
	<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes or if a user no longer desires to use the Xfire service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done via the "profile" page.</p>
	
	<p><span class="p_storytitle">Cookies &amp; Beacons</span><br>
	Xfire uses cookies and beacons to assist in delivering the service and to provide a positive and personalized user experience. Cookies are files sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Our persistent and session ID Cookies are used to identify unique visitors and to provide a personalized user experience. Beacons are bits of code that function similar to cookies. Our beacons are embedded in outgoing emails and generate a call back to the Xfire server when such emails are opened. Xfire uses beacons to track the status of sent emails.</p>
	
	<p><span class="p_storytitle">Security</span><br>
	Xfire has implemented processes designed to protect user information and maintain security. Each registered user is assigned a unique user name and password which is required to access their account and relationship information. It is the user's responsibility to protect the security of their login information. Xfire's servers are located in secure server environments. Firewalls and other advanced security technologies are employed to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of data.</p>
	
	<p><span class="p_storytitle">Third Party Sites</span><br>
	Xfire's service contains links to third party games, game services and web sites not associated with Xfire. Xfire is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such sites and games. Users will need to review the policy statements of these sites and games to understand their privacy policies.</p>
	
	<p><span class="p_storytitle">Privacy Policy Changes</span><br>
	Xfire reserves the right to make changes to this privacy statement. Any material changes to this statement will be prominently posted online and accessible via the Xfire site prior to taking effect.</p>
