	<p class="p_storytitle2">Privacy policy and your California rights</p>
	<p>This is the official privacy policy ("<b>Privacy Policy</b>") for the <b>Xfire</b> service("<b>Service</b>," "<b>we</b>,"
"<b>us</b>," or "<b>our</b>"), an online gaming communication service offered by Xfire, Inc. a MTV Networks ("<b>MTVN</b>") Company, a division of Viacom International Inc. (collectively, the "<b>Parent Companies</b>"). This Privacy Policy governs only the personally identifiable information ("<b>Personal Information</b>") collected by the Service and does not cover any such information collected in any other manner or for any other purpose, or for or by any other MTVN programming channel, MTVN's "Jobhunt" website, the Parent Companies and any subsidiaries and affiliates of Xfire and the Parent Companies (collectively, "<b>Affiliates</b>"), or any other company, unless specifically stated.</p>

	<p>
		<span class="p_storytitle">Overview: This Privacy Policy is intended to explain our privacy practices and inform you as to:</span>
		</p><li>The kinds of Personal Information we collect from users of the Service and how that information is collected;</li>
		<li>How we use your Personal Information;</li>
		<li>The circumstances under which we disclose Personal Information to third parties;</li>
		<li>How you can access, update or delete any Personal Information collected about you by us; and</li>
		<li>The mechanisms we have implemented to protect your Personal Information.</li>
	<p></p>
	
	<p>"This Service is offered and made available only to users 13 years of age or older who reside in the United States of America, its territories and possessions ("<b>U.S.</b>") <b>If you are not yet 13 years old or the required greater age for certain features, or do not reside in the U.S., please discontinue using the Service immediately, or if, for any reason, you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the features, activities and services that require you to provide your Personal Information.</b> This Privacy Policy is a part of the terms and conditions which are set forth in our <a href="/terms_and_conditions/">Terms of Use Agreement</a>. Any terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given in the Terms of Use Agreement. Both the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement are legally binding on all users.</p>
	<p>We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting. Notice of material changes to either document will be posted on the Service's homepage and/or will be provided by e-mailing you or notifying you upon login about these changes; the form of such notice is at our discretion. However, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement often for updates.</p>
	<p>We are committed to protecting users' privacy. Keeping the Personal Information you share with us on the Service secure and ensuring your understanding of how we collect, use, disclose and maintain your Personal Information is important to us. We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information and while no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your Personal Information.</p>
	
	<p class="p_storytitle2">Your California privacy rights</p>
	<p>If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives either an opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as "<b>unsubscribe</b>") or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.</p>

	<p>Xfire qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.</p>
	<p>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:privacy-admin@xfire.com">privacy-admin@xfire.com</a>, or you may contact us via regular mail at:</p>
	<p><b>Xfire, Inc.<br>Attn: Your California Privacy Rights<br>c/o Victoria Libin, Privacy Administrator<br>225 Bush St, San Francisco, CA 94104<br></b></p>
	<p><b>All requests sent via regular mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy Rights" on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request.</b> For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code (your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email. Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping). <b>We will not accept requests via the telephone or by
facsimile</b>. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.</p>
	<p>To all other users of this Service, if you have other questions about this Privacy Policy, please
contact our Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:privacy-admin@xfire.com">privacy-admin@xfire.com</a> or:</p>

We may also combine Personal Information we collect online with information available from other sources, including information received from our Affiliates, marketing companies, or Advertisers (as defined in the <a href="/terms_and_conditions">Terms of Use Agreement</a>). This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Service, even if your use of or participation in any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason.</p>
	<p>1.<b>Collection and Use of Personal Information</b>: When we use the term "<b>Personal Information</b>" we mean information such as your first/middle initial or name and last name, street address, town or city, state, zip code, telephone number, instant-messenger nickname, blog or other personal website URL, date of birth, e-mail address and any other information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you.

		<p><b>c.

There may be a separate registration process which will require the submission of all or some of the following: your first and last name, street address, city, state and zip code, email address, telephone number and date of birth.

Please see the <a href="/faq/#249">Delete Your Personal Information</a> section for details.</p>		
		<p><b>e. Sharing of Aggregate Information with Third Parties.</b> Some of the aggregate user data we collect may be shared with Advertisers, our Affiliates, and other business partners of the Service, its Parent Companies, and/or its Affiliates, but we do not give any Personal Information to them as part of the relationship except as described in this Privacy Policy.

	<p><b>2. Wireless Marketing Services and Promotional Opportunities</b>: Xfire may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from Xfire either by registering on the Service or via their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by Affiliates for Xfire. The Personal Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user's telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier's name. Optional information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, choices of video games, or other similar survey information. Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other information and, depending on the information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement.</p>
	<p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p>
	<p>Users that register for Xfire's wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from Xfire. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. <b>Under no circumstances will the Service, Xfire, its Parent Companies, or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a users wireless device, telephone number, or email address.</b></p>

	<div class="static_verbage_indent">
		
		<p>a. <b>Registration</b>. To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for Xfire's wireless marketing services. Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the "single opt-in" or the "double-opt-in" (Service/SMS) method, at the discretion of Xfire depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will require the "double opt-in" (Service/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p>

		<div class="static_verbage_indent">
			
			<p><b>1) Single Opt-in Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The user's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to Xfire will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to Xfire to send text messages to him or her. Xfire will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a \"Thank you\" message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in
any text message from Xfire or by sending a text message to Xfire that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT".</p>		
			<p><b>2) Double Opt-in (Service/SMS) Method</b>: In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to the Service's web site to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to Xfire's sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested Xfire and by clicking the consent statement on the Service's registration page. The user must also agree to the Service's <a href="/privacy_policy/">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="/terms_and_conditions/">Terms of Use Agreement</a> before the online registration process is completed. Xfire will then send a \"Confirmation\" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Xfire to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the \"Confirmation\" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of Xfire's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the \"Confirmation\" message at any time <b>provided that</b> Xfire may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received Xfire continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p>			
			<p><b>3) Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. Xfire] will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Xfire to that
particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of Xfire's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time provided that Xfire] may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while Xfire continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p>

	<p><b>7. Security &amp; Protection of Personal Information</b>: We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. However, for most Internet sites or services, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of the Service. We also limit access to the Service by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow the same policy.</p>
	<p><b>8. Phishing</b>: Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial account credentials. "Phishers" use 'spoofed' e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Personal Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords, and social security numbers. WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD! If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Service\'s Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:privacy-admin@xfire.com">privacy-admin@xfire.com</a>, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.</p>
	<p><b>9. Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information</b>: Generally, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information or Confidential Personal Information collected by the Service.

Personal Information collected for certain entries are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user's request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.</p>	
	<p>Children under the age of 13, or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of this Service ("<b>Ineligible Teenagers</b>"), that are unknowingly registered on the Service are in violation of the <a href="/terms_and_conditions/">Terms of Use Agreement</a>. Parents (including legal guardians) of children or Ineligible Teenagers that registered on the Service in violation of the Terms of Use Agreement who wish to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership must use their child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID to gain direct access to the account, and select "EDIT PROFILE" or alternatively, you can send us an email to the Service's Privacy Administrator and provide us with your child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID and request to terminate your child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user's account and Personal Information by any person without the user's User ID (please see above for how to change your preferences or the information associated with your account). If a parent does not have his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID, the parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child's or Ineligible Teenager's name and email address as registered on the Service, plus the child's or Ineligible Teenager's date of birth. The parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent of the ineligible child or Ineligible Teenager. Xfire will send a confirming email to the parent via the email address provided to verify that the parent wishes to terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. The parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. Xfire will then terminate the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.</p>	
	<p>We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features or functions of the Service if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access the user's account or any services, features or functions. And if the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.</p>
	<p><b>10. Questions:</b> If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or if you do not understand any information about how we collect, maintain, use or share your Personal Information, you may contact us directly by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy-admin@xfire.com">privacy-admin@xfire.com</a>.</p>
