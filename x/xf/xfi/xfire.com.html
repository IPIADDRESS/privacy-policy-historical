	<p class="p_storytitle2">Privacy policy and your California rights</p>
	<p>This is the official privacy policy ("<b>Privacy Policy</b>") for the <b>Xfire</b> service("<b>Service</b>," "<b>we</b>,"
"<b>us</b>," or "<b>our</b>"), an online gaming communication service offered by Xfire, Inc. a MTV Networks ("<b>MTVN</b>") Company, a division of Viacom International Inc. (collectively, the "<b>Parent Companies</b>"). This Privacy Policy governs only the personally identifiable information ("<b>Personal Information</b>") collected by the Service and does not cover any such information collected in any other manner or for any other purpose, or for or by any other MTVN programming channel, MTVN's "Jobhunt" website, the Parent Companies and any subsidiaries and affiliates of Xfire and the Parent Companies (collectively, "<b>Affiliates</b>"), or any other company, unless specifically stated.</p>

	<p>
		<span class="p_storytitle">Overview: This Privacy Policy is intended to explain our privacy practices and inform you as to:</span>
		</p><li>The kinds of Personal Information we collect from users of the Service and how that information is collected;</li>
		<li>How we use your Personal Information;</li>
		<li>The circumstances under which we disclose Personal Information to third parties;</li>
		<li>How you can access, update or delete any Personal Information collected about you by us; and</li>
		<li>The mechanisms we have implemented to protect your Personal Information.</li>
	<p></p>
	
	<p>"This Service is offered and made available only to users 13 years of age or older who reside in the United States of America, its territories and possessions ("<b>U.S.</b>") <b>If you are not yet 13 years old or the required greater age for certain features, or do not reside in the U.S., please discontinue using the Service immediately, or if, for any reason, you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the features, activities and services that require you to provide your Personal Information.</b> This Privacy Policy is a part of the terms and conditions which are set forth in our <a href="/terms_and_conditions/">Terms of Use Agreement</a>. Any terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given in the Terms of Use Agreement. Both the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement are legally binding on all users.</p>
	<p>We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting. Notice of material changes to either document will be posted on the Service's homepage and/or will be provided by e-mailing you or notifying you upon login about these changes; the form of such notice is at our discretion. However, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement often for updates.</p>
	<p>We are committed to protecting users' privacy. Keeping the Personal Information you share with us on the Service secure and ensuring your understanding of how we collect, use, disclose and maintain your Personal Information is important to us. We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information and while no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your Personal Information.</p>
	
	<p class="p_storytitle2">Your California privacy rights</p>
	<p>If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives either an opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as "<b>unsubscribe</b>") or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.</p>

	<p>Xfire qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.</p>
	<p>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:privacy-admin@xfire.com">privacy-admin@xfire.com</a>, or you may contact us via regular mail at:</p>
	<p><b>Xfire, Inc.<br>Attn: Your California Privacy Rights<br>c/o Victoria Libin, Privacy Administrator<br>225 Bush St, San Francisco, CA 94104<br></b></p>
	<p><b>All requests sent via regular mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy Rights" on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request.</b> For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code (your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email. Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping). <b>We will not accept requests via the telephone or by
facsimile</b>. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.</p>
	<p>To all other users of this Service, if you have other questions about this Privacy Policy, please
contact our Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:privacy-admin@xfire.com">privacy-admin@xfire.com</a> or:</p>
