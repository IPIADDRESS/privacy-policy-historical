				We may collect personal information that can identify you such as your name and e-mail address, as well as other information that does not identify you. When you provide personal information through our Sites, the information may be sent to our servers located in the United States.<br><br>
				User Provided Information. We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our Sites or provide to us in some other manner. This includes identifying information (such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number), and any other personal information you choose to provide while using our Sites or the Services. For example, when you open an account with Xy7Elite, we collect certain personal financial information in order to properly process payments to you such as your billing address, bank name and address, and bank account number.<br><br>
				Third Party List Information. We may also obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from third party data gathering sources. We may match this third-party collected information with the personally identifying information that you provide to us. When obtaining this information from third parties, Xy7Elite seeks assurances from such third parties that they have the right to provide the information to us.<br><br>
				Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information Collection Technology. We and our business partners, such as advertisers, may use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our Sites. For example, we and our business partners may collect and store non-personally identifying information through technologies such as log files, cookies, web beacons (also known as clear gifs), tracking pixels, and similar technology used by third parties to help determine user viewing preferences for advertising and other purposes.<br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>Log Files. Technical information from your browser is automatically collected when you visit our Sites. This information includes your IP address, your browser type, operating system, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see "Cookies" below), and the referring website address. </li>
					<li>Cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's computer that tracks non-personal information about the user. When using our Sites, we may assign your computer one or more cookies which enable us to improve the quality of our Service and to personalize your experience. Cookies allow us to automatically collect information about your activity on our Sites, such as the web pages you visit, the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions you conduct while using our Sites. The cookies do not store any personally identifiable information about you. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to disable cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, you will still be able to access our Sites, but you may not be able to use all of the interactive features we offer. Additional information on cookies can be found at: http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm.</li>
					<li>Web Beacons. We, or our advertisers, may use standard Internet technology such as web beacons (or "clear gifs"), tracking pixels, and other similar technologies, to gather aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about your use of our Sites. We also may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the quality of our Sites. </li>
					<li>Information collected by third-parties. We and our business partners, such as advertisers, may use tracking technologies, such as cookies and tracking pixels, to collect information about users who view or interact with these advertisements and connect to other websites.

				No Information From Children. Xy7Elite will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because we do not collect such information, we have no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. The Sites target an audience that is over the age of 18 and some content may not be appropriate for all ages. We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.

For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our Sites and the most popular features or Services accessed.<br><br>
					Please note that our Privacy Policy does not cover any third party's use or handling of your information once it is shared. Rather, the privacy policies of the various third parties will govern.

					<b>Choice/Opt-Out</b><br><br>
					We give our users the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our Sites at the point where we ask for the information.

To opt-out of communications from our third party business partners, please contact them directly. <br><br>
					<b>Updating Your Information</b><br><br>
					If you have questions or want to update your personal information, please contact us at: notices@rapidresponseonline.com or by mail at Xy7Elite, a division of Rapid Response Marketing, LLC Attn: Privacy, 7500 W. Lake Mead Blvd. #9-463, Las Vegas, NV. 89128.<br><br>

					<b>Privacy Policy Changes</b><br><br>
					This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in our practices and Services. We reserve the right to modify it at any time, so please review it frequently. When changes are made to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share personal information that may impact you, we will also prominently post notice of the changes on our Sites and/or we may notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an e-mail address or you have opted-out of such communication).
