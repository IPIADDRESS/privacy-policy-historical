<h1>XNXX.COM PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p>
We, <b>NKL Associates, s.r.o.</b>, a company registered and existing under the laws of the Czech Republic, with registration number 023 30 482 having its registered seat at Krakovska 1366/25, 110 00 Prague 1, CZECH REPUBLIC, are operating
Xnxx.com and are the responsible data controller in the sense of Article 2 (b) of European
Directive 95/46/EC. See here <a href="http://www.xnxx.com/contact">http://www.xnxx.com/contact</a> for further contact information. We are processing personal data only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>1. Use of personal data</h3>
<p>Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable data subject,
including names, ages, addresses, and email addresses. A data subject shall be considered
identified or identifiable if it is possible to identify the data subject directly or indirectly in
particular on the basis of one or more factors specific to his/her physical, physiological,
economic, cultural or social identity.</p>
<p>We collect, process and retain personal data to the extent it is necessary to provide users with
our service, especially for the following purposes, e.g. identifying a registered user, keeping
search and video preferences, keeping the likes of unregistered users, displaying advertisements, keeping statistics, etc. We do not collect, process or retain personal data unless
allowed under statutory laws, required by a judicial or governmental order, or the user has
given its consent. We collect all personal data by ourselves and by our means. We use automatic processing of personal data via our information system.</p>
<p><em>Unregistered Users</em></p>
<p>Persons who visit Xnxx without logging in or registering are unregistered users. The only
personal data we collect from unregistered users is their IP addresses, which we delete with
fifteen (15) minutes after each visit. We do not associate IP addresses with any of the unregistered users'
specific activity (such as videos they view) on the site. Unregistered users' IP
addresses are only used to prepare aggregate statistics about the overall activity on Xnxx.
Such aggregate statistics include the countries visitors came from and the types of electronic device used; they do not contain any personal information.</p>
<p><em>Registered Users</em></p>
<p>Persons who choose to create an account are registered users. It is possible to create an account
without providing your name. You can maintain your account under an alias or pseudonym.
Upon account creation, new users are sent a confirmation link by email.
If registration is confirmed, you accept to receive emails to notify specific events such as new friends
requests, likes on your uploads etc.</p>
<p>When users create accounts they are creating profile pages that, if they so choose, the public
and other Xnxx registered users can view. Registered users can choose what content to
display on their profile, and can individually adjust the privacy settings on their profile pages
to restrict access.</p>
<p>We collect the following data from registered users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any information the user submits to us during account creation, such as username,
password, name, email address, password, country, region, and age; and</li>
<li>Any information a user submits to us using our contact form; and</li>
<li>Any content that the user creates (for example, posting a comment or uploading a
photo or video); and</li>
<li>The IP address during the account creation process and whenever a video is uploaded;
and</li>
<li>The clicks and views of the user; and</li>
<li>Any voluntary information the user provides to personalize the user's account (for
example, adding a video to their favourite lists or linking to another social media
account).</li>
</ul>
<p>This information may contain <b>sensitive information</b> about the user including the <b>sexual
preferences</b>, <b>ethnicity</b> and <b>religion</b> of the user if he/she wishes to share this information to
connect with other users. This information is only retained as long as the user does not delete
or change the information in his/her user account. The information can only be seen by other
registered users and is not shared or processed in any other way.</p>
<p>Except to the extent detailed above, we do not track registered users' activity on Xnxx.
We only prepares aggregate statistics about clicks and views; we do not track every click or
video watched by users and associate that with the users' accounts. Please also see additional
information about cookies below.</p>
