                        <p>Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement applies to the data collected by Microsoft through the XNA.COM site (the “Site”) it does not apply to data collected through other online or offline Microsoft sites, products or services. </p>
                        <p>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION<br>
                        We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you. The personal information we collect may include your email address and physical address.</p>

                        <p>In support of these uses, Microsoft may use personal information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the Site and any related Microsoft products or services, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Site to your particular preference or interests.</p>

We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. </p>
                        <p>Microsoft may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft and our family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Microsoft products or members of the public. <br>

                        <p>USE OF COOKIES<br>
                        We use cookies on this Site to ensure the integrity of the registration process and to personalize the Site.
