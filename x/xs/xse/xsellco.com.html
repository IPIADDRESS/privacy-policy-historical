				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Information From Other Sources: In order to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing,
					offers, and services to you, we may obtain information about you from other sources, such as public
					databases, joint marketing partners, social media platforms, as well as from other third parties.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Through Your Browser or Device: Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically
					through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or
					Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model,
					language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the Site (such as the Apps)
					you are using.
				</p>
			</li>

				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Through Cookies and Other Similar Technologies: Cookies and other similar technologies may be used
					to collect information. We may use third parties to serve advertisements on other websites that may
					be of interest to you, based on information collected about your use of our Site and other websites.
					To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through
					the use of pixel tags and web beacons). Please refer to the cookies section below for more

			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			xSellco also uses web analytics services, which currently include Google Analytics. xSellco also uses Google
			AdWords.
		</p>
		<p>
			Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics
			uses cookies and similar technologies to analyse how users use the Site. The information generated about
			Site usage (including your shortened IP address) is transmitted to Google. This information is used to
			evaluate visitors’ use of the Site, compile statistical reports on Site activity, and provide other
			services related to the Site and internet use. Google may also collect information about Site visitors’
			use of other websites. For more information about Google Analytics, or to opt out of Google Analytics,
			please go to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			xSellco uses Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to
			previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t
			completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the
			form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network.
			Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to our
			Site. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s
			privacy policy. You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/">Google Ad Preferences page</a>, and if you want to
			you can&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/">opt out of interest-based advertising
				entirely by cookie settings</a>&nbsp;or permanently using a browser plugin.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Cookies
		</h2>
		<p>
			When you interact with the Site, we try to make that experience simple and meaningful. When you visit the
			Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are small pieces of information which are
			issued to your computer when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information about your
			use of the Site. For example, cookies are used to personalise web search engines and to store shopping lists
			of items a user has selected while browsing through a virtual shopping mall. A number of cookies we use last
			only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser. Other cookies are used to
			remember you when you return to the Site and will last for longer.
		</p>
		<p>
			We use cookies to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					Remember that you have visited us before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors
					we receive. This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get;
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the Site;
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Collect statistical information about how you use the Site (including how long you spend on the
					Site) and where you have come to the Site from, so that we can improve the Site and learn which
					parts of the Site are most popular with visitors; and
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					to speed site navigation and recognise your access rights on the site.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent
			that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie</a>&nbsp;which
