Note that there is no legal obligation for you to provide us with personal information and any information collected by us will be provided by you at your own will and with your consent.</li>
			<li>Information From Other Sources: In order to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing, offers, and services to you, we may obtain information about you from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, social media platforms, as well as from other third parties.</li>

		<h2>Cookies</h2>

		<p>When you interact with the Site, we try to make that experience simple and meaningful. When you visit the Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the Site. For example, cookies are used to personalise web search engines and to store shopping lists of items a user has selected while browsing through a virtual shopping mall. A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Site and will last for longer.</p>
		<p>We use cookies to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Remember that you have visited us before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive. This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get;</li>
			<li>Customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the Site;</li>
			<li>Collect statistical information about how you use the Site (including how long you spend on the Site) and where you have come to the Site from, so that we can improve the Site and learn which parts of the Site are most popular with visitors; and</li>
			<li>to speed site navigation and recognise your access rights on the site.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie</a> which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browser.

				<td>Cookie purpose</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Necessary</td>
				<td>These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around websites and use the websites’ features, such as accessing secure websites or secure areas of websites. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, such as identifying you as being logged in to the Site throughout your visit, cannot be provided.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Functionality</td>
				<td>These cookies allow the Site to remember choices you make (such as your preferred language) and provide enhanced, more personal features.  These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. Other examples include cookies that keep track of your progress when filling online application forms.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Performance</td>
				<td>These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. xSellco uses both first and third party analytics cookies for this purpose.</td>

			<tr>
				<td>Targeting Cookies</td>
				<td>Targeting cookies remember individual websites you have visited and help xSellco to present relevant and targeted online advertising to you.  Targeting cookies may be placed on your machine when you visit the Site.  When targeting cookies have been placed on your device, they can be recognised by subsequent websites you visit, and this allows those sites to present targeted xSellco and third party advertising to you.  While targeting cookies can track your visits around different websites, the information collected is anonymous.</td>

		<h2>Information sharing</h2>
		<p>We may disclose aggregate statistics about visitors to the Site, customers and sales in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, sponsors and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information.</p>
		<p>We may also disclose your personal information to any of our affiliates, or to our agents or contractors who assist us in providing the services we offer through the Site, processing transactions, fulfilling requests for information, receiving and sending communications, updating marketing lists, analysing data, providing support services or in other tasks, from time to time. Our agents and contractors will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform their functions.</p>
		<p>Where you consent, we may share your information with other related parties and any entity who is under common control. In the event that we undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party, you agree that any personal information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or third party.</p>

		<h2>Payment processing</h2>
		<p>Payment details you provide will be encrypted using secure sockets layer (SSL) technology before they are submitted to us over the internet. Payments made on the Site are made through our payment gateway provider, Stripe. You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to Stripe which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorising payment.

For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorised personnel have access to personal information. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.</p>
		<p>You should bear in mind that submission of information over the internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Site whilst it is in transit over the internet and any such submission is at your own risk.</p>
		<p>It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal information if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.</p>

		<h2>Storage of your information</h2>
		<p>Information that you submit via the Site is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the United States, Asia and in the EEA. Information submitted by you may also be transferred by us to our other offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described above (see Information sharing), which may be situated outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA. The countries concerned may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA. Where we transfer your information we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected. By submitting information via the Site, you agree to this storing, processing and/or transfer.</p>
