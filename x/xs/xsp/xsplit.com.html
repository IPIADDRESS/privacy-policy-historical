<h2>International Data Transfer (For EU users)</h2>
<p>The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at servers outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff of SplitmediaLabs or our subsidiaries, operating outside the EEA. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing in countries outside of the EEA where we operate. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We take all reasonable steps to protect information we receive from you from loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and/or destruction.

<h2>Privacy of Children</h2>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old to use our Services or such minimum required age in your country which allows for collection of your personally identifiable information. In addition to being of the minimum required age to use our Services under applicable law, if you are not old enough to have authority to agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy in your country, your parent or guardian must agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy on your behalf before you may use the Services.</p>
<p>If we learn that personally identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age or less than the age required in their country, has been collected on or through the Services, we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information and delete the child’s account for the Services.</p>
<p>If you have knowledge of use of the Services by a child under 13 or under the age required for using the Services in your country, then please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@splitmedialabs.com">privacy@splitmedialabs.com</a> to have that child’s account terminated and information deleted.</p>
