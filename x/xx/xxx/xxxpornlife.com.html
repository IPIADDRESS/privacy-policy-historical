<br><br>
<b style="color:#1E4C8C;font-size:14px"><u>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</u></b><br>
We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains 
our practices with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal and non-personal information provided by 
visitors to our Web site. By using this site, you signify your assent to these our privacy practices and the terms and 
conditions of our Web site. <b>If you do not agree, please do not use this site.</b> 
<br><br>
<b style="color:#1E4C8C;font-size:14px"><u>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</u></b><br>

<b>Personal Information</b><br>
We only collect personal information from visitors to our Web site when they voluntarily provide it to us by completing our 
registration form or electing to use one of our services In doing so, we may require visitors to provide us with 
information including, but not limited to, their name, physical address, email address, birth date, credit card number, 
credit card expiration date, username, password, unique identifier (such as their social security number), and demographic 
information (such as their income level). <br><br>
<b>Non-Personal Information</b><br>
When visitors access our Web site, certain non-personal information may be collected from them including, but not limited 
to, their browser type (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), IP address, 
and the domain name from which they accessed the site (e.g., lycos.com)  
In addition, we may collect information about visitors' browsing behavior, such as the date and time they visit the Web 
site, the areas or pages of our Web site that they visit, the amount of time spent viewing the site, the number of times 
the visitor returns to the site, and click-stream data. We use transparent tracking pixels to determine the number of Web 
site visitors that have been sent to us through our affiliate network. We do not track any information about visitors once 
they leave our site.  We may use cookies (small text files that are stored on visitors computers when they access our Web 
site) to collect this information.  Information collected through cookies may be combined with visitors' personal 
information.  We may also allow unaffiliated third parties, such as advertisers, to serve cookies to visitors of our Web 
site.    
Visitors are always free to decline cookies, but in doing so they may not be able to use certain features on our Web site.  
The "help" segment of the toolbar on most browsers explains how to configure a browser to not accept new cookies, how to 
have the browser inform a user when they receive a new cookie, and how to erase cookies from their hard drives.  
<br>
<br>

<b style="color:#1E4C8C;font-size:14px"><u>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION?</u></b><br>



Our goal in collecting personal information is to provide visitors with the most personalized Web experience possible and 
our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing a little about our visitors, we are able to 
deliver more relevant content and advertisements, and provide better services. 
We may use information collected from visitors to our Web site for any of the following purposes: (1) to send visitors 
information and promotional materials about our company, (2) to send visitors information and promotional materials from 
our marketing partners and third parties (such as advertisers on our Web site), (3) to deliver targeted display 
advertisements and offers by email (by matching criteria provided by our advertisers with information collected from our 
visitors), (4) to contact visitors to our Web site when necessary, (5) to allow one-click purchases or access to 
proprietary content by pre-populating fields, within registration or other transaction screens, with a visitor's name, 
billing address, and credit or charge card information (among other things), as provided by that visitor, (6) to help 
diagnose problems with our server, (7) to administer our Web site, (8) to conduct internal reviews of our site (e.g., to 
determine the number of visitors to the site), (9) to help us better understand visitors' use of our site, and (10) to 
protect the security or integrity of our site.  Non-personal information will be used for purposes of conducting internal 
reviews of the site, monitoring the site, and providing a greater online experience for our visitors.  
<br>
<br>
<b style="color:#1E4C8C;font-size:14px"><u>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE DISCLOSE?</u></b><br>
 
We may transfer or otherwise disclose information collected from visitors to our Web site to our employees and independent 
contractors, to our parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates, and to our consultants, other business associates, and 
suppliers, if the disclosure will enable that party to perform a business, professional, or technical support function for 
us, or if required to do so by law.  We may also disclose information we collect from our site visitors to our marketing 
and business partners, who may use the information in connection with their business operations, such as to send marketing 
and other communications to visitors of our site.  
<br>
We may also share, rent, sell, or transfer any personal information (including financial information) provided by our 
visitors to third parties.  During the registration process, and at certain times during any member user session, we may 
present additional offers from third party service providers.  Our third party service providers have their own terms and 
conditions and privacy policies. We suggest that visitors access these third party sites and review their terms and 
conditions and privacy policies before  "subscribing" to any third party offer. If a visitor subscribes to a third party 
offer during our registration process, we will transfer the financial data they provided to us as part of the registration 
process to that third party company, which will then process the transaction using that financial data.  
We may also share non-personal information we collect from visitors to our site, such as their browsing behaviors, with 
third parties. For example, we may tell a third party advertiser that a certain number of people have visited a certain 
area on our Web site.  
<br>
<br>
<b style="color:#1E4C8C;font-size:14px"><u>WHAT SECURITY MEASURES DO WE TAKE TO PROTECT YOUR DATA?</u></b><br>

To help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data integrity, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in 
place certain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect from 
visitors to our Web site.  We use Secure Socket Layer technology to protect any credit card information you provide us.  We 
allow access to personal information only to persons and entities engaging in activities provided for by this Privacy 
Policy.  
Visitors should consider any communication that they transmit to us (such as data, questions or answers, comments, 
suggestions, or communications submitted to a chat room) to be non-confidential.  We will not be liable or responsible if 
information that belongs to a	visitor	is	intercepted	and	used		by	an	unintended	
recipient. 
<br>
<br>
<b style="color:#1E4C8C;font-size:14px"><u>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</u></b><br>

attract anyone under the age of 18 (21 in some areas) and we do not allow anyone under the age of 18 (21 in some areas) to 
register and become	a	member	of	our	site. 
<br>
<br>
<b style="color:#1E4C8C;font-size:14px"><u>UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES</u></b><br>

In the event of a merger, acquisition, asset or stock sale, bankruptcy, or other asset transfer (regardless of legal 
formality), any of our assets may be transferred to a third party, including personal information collected from visitors 
to our Web site.  
<br>
