<p>Lion Nathan may also use your personal  information for other purposes not listed above which will be made obvious to  you at the time Lion Nathan collects that information, or for such purposes as  may be required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>If Lion Nathan uses your personal  information for direct marketing purposes, all correspondence sent to you by  Lion Nathan will give you the opportunity to “opt out” of receiving any further  direct marketing correspondence.<br>

</ul>
<p>Other than those third parties referred to  above, Lion Nathan will not disclose your personal information to any other  third party unless it has reasonable grounds to believe:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you have authorised Lion Nathan  to do so;</li>

  <li>your safety, or the safety of  others in the community, is at risk; or</li>
  <li>Lion Nathan is required or  permitted by law to do so. </li>
</ul>
<p>If Lion Nathan provides your personal  information to a third party, Lion Nathan generally requires the third party to  protect your personal information in the same way Lion Nathan does.<br>
  Is my personal information secure?<br>
  Lion Nathan takes reasonable steps to  ensure personal information it holds about you is protected from risks such as  loss, unauthorised access, use, destruction, modification or disclosure. Lion  Nathan only permits its authorised personnel or consultants to access your  personal information for legitimate business purposes.</p>
<p>No data transmission over the internet is  totally secure. As a result, any personal information you send to Lion Nathan  over the Internet (including via email) is sent at your own risk.</p>
