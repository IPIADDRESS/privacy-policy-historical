			<p></p><p>Xpressbet respects Your individual privacy. This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") embodies our commitment to its protection through adherence to fair electronic information practices. This Privacy Policy puts You in control of how Your personal information is processed. You have our promise that we will not electronically process Your personal information in any way that is incompatible with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h1>COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h1>
<p>With Your consent, we use Your personal information for purposes of monitoring and improving our internal operations, as well as to ensure we (i) bill You properly, (ii) administer Your Account in accordance with Your agreements with us, (iii) properly perform the services You have requested, (iv) comply with applicable state, provincial and federal legal requirements, (v) identify Your preferences as a customer, (vi) inform You about upcoming events, promotions and new and improved services, (vii) protect You and Xpressbet against error and fraud, and (viii) comply with our internal risk management and related policies. We also use the personal information we collect to monitor and improve our internal operations, as well as to improve the experience of users in our network of web sites. For example, we may correlate web site traffic information with data about individual users. This data helps us to determine how much our customers use parts of this web site (the “Site”), allowing us to enhance it to fit the needs of as many of our customers as possible. We may also break down overall usage statistics according to customers' domain names, browser types, and MIME types by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). Xpressbet owns and operates the Site.</p>
<p>Xpressbet does not collect personal information about You except when You provide it to Xpressbet on a voluntary basis, and does not collect, use or disclose Your personal information without first obtaining Your consent.</p>
<p>During Your use of the Site, You may be asked to voluntarily provide personal information (including without limitation Your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, fax number, profile data, zip code or postal code, age, gender, income level and credit card information) to Xpressbet.

For the purposes of verification of Your identity when You create an account, You specifically acknowledge that Xpressbet will be providing Your personal information to a third party provider for the verification of Your age, residency and background for the purposes of providing You an Account with Xpressbet.</p>
<p>Your contact information is used when Xpressbet needs to contact You directly. It is also used to identify what future products or services You may require. Xpressbet will not sell Your personal information or otherwise share it with third parties without Your permission. We use the information we collect to direct important notices and information affecting Your Account or services on the Site as well as to provide general information that may be of interest to You which may include newsletters, surveys, contest announcements, and information about our service or product offerings or the offerings of our business affiliates.

<h1>OBTAINING CONSENT</h1>

<h1>MAINTENANCE AND DISPOSAL OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h1>
<p>The information You have provided us is maintained in our management information system and billing systems, and is updated as new information is added. Accounting and billing records are retained for ten years for tax and accounting purposes or until the relevant income tax years for which the document was created have been closed for income tax purposes and/or all appeals have been exhausted. Records may remain on file even after You have terminated Your Account. Subject to applicable law, we may also keep records to facilitate collection and to evaluate credit worthiness.</p>

We will only use and disclose Your personal information to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as otherwise identified in this Privacy Policy.

<h1>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h1>
<p>Your personal information will not be sold to any organization for any purpose. We will not disclose Your personal information to any third party without your consent, except that we reserve the right to disclose Your personal information: (a) to any of our affiliates, subsidiaries, third party service providers or advisers that we deem appropriate; (b) if such disclosure is made pursuant to a legal proceeding or as required by law; (c) to another business entity should we plan to merge with, or be acquired by that business entity; or (d) organizations involved in a merger, transfer or sale of our assets or business.</p>
<p>In the event that we disclose Your personal information as set out above, we will require third party organizations who have access to Your personal information to protect and maintain Your personal information in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h1>NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION &amp; USE OF COOKIES</h1>
<p>Like many other web sites You may visit, the Site automatically collects certain non-personal information regarding You, such as the date and time You access the Site, the Internet address of the web site from which You linked to the Site, the operating system You are using, and the Site pages read and images viewed. This non-personal information is used for system administration purposes and to improve the Site. Non-personal information may be disclosed to other persons and permanently archived for future use. The Site also uses "cookies", a technology that installs a small data file onto Your browser from a web server which is then stored on Your computer's hard drive, which thereafter permits the Site to recognize future visits from that computer. Cookies do not damage Your system or impair its functioning in any way. Xpressbet uses cookies to tailor and enhance Your experience at the Site, to show You content that You might be interested in, and to display the content according to Your preferences. Cookies do not contain any personal identifying information and only contain information such as a user ID that a web site uses to track the pages You have visited. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information You supply Yourself. A cookie cannot read data off Your hard disk or read cookie files created by other web sites. We use cookies to track users traffic patterns when You make any requests for Xpressbet services. When You make Your request, we may use a cookie to store a unique, random user ID. We use this ID to identify You anonymously in our database and to track the pages You visit on the Site. You can reset Your browser to refuse all cookies or to allow Your browser to show You when a cookie is sent.</p>
<h1>LINKS</h1>
<p>The Site contains links to other web sites. You understand and agree that Your use of such third party web sites will be governed by the privacy policies of those web sites and not by this Privacy Policy. The Site is not responsible or liable for the use of Your personal information that may be collected by a third-party web site that has a link on the Site. Xpressbet is not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or the content of any such third-party web sites. Xpressbet does not control, monitor or endorse the information gathering practices or privacy policies of any such third-party websites. Whenever applicable, You should seek to read the privacy policy of any third-party web site that has a link on the Site.</p>
<h1>PUBLIC FORUMS</h1>
<p>Please be aware that any information (personal or otherwise) that is disclosed online in a message board or chat room makes that information public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose Your personal information online. Xpressbet is not responsible for personally identifiable information posted on such message boards or chat rooms.</p>
<h1>SECURITY</h1>
<p>Xpressbet has adopted and implemented and will maintain reasonable and technologically feasible procedures for maintaining the security, accuracy and integrity of all personal information that is collected by the Site in order to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the personal information under our control.</p>
<p>All data is kept on secure database servers, separately from the web servers, which are all behind a firewall with very restrictive access. All data entry is done via a secure interface that provides no export facility. Please be advised, however, that the Internet and other various networking communication mediums are not secure, unless explicitly specified as such, and may be subject to interception or loss which is beyond the control of Xpressbet. Also be advised that the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between You and Xpressbet through the Site cannot be guaranteed. You should consider any information provided to or collected by the Site as non-confidential, and consequently the Site assumes no liability or responsibility if any of Your personal information is intercepted and/or used by an unintended recipient.</p>
<p>Xpressbet will not monitor, edit or deliberately disclose the contents of Your private communications or files, except in circumstances where we inadvertently obtain information that appears to pertain to the commission of a crime or where we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person exists.
