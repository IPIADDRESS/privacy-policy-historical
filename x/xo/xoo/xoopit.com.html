This Policy was last modified December, 2008.
</p>
<p>
Xoopit, Inc. ("Xoopit," "we," or "us") knows that you
care how information about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy
explains what information of yours will be collected by Xoopit when you use
xoopit.com and related services (the "Site"), how the information will be used,
and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of
information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as
described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
If you have questions about the Privacy Policy or would like to suggest improvements, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@xoopit.com">privacy@xoopit.com</a>.
</p>
<h2>
Information We Collect
</h2>
<p>
<b>User-Provided Information:</b>
You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and email
address, company name, city, country, zip code, postal mailing address, etc,
when you register with the Site or respond to certain offers on the Site. If
you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email
messages, your email address and our responses.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cookies Information:</b>
When you visit xoopit.com or other websites we own or operate, we may send one or
more cookies—a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric
characters—to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and
lets Xoopit help
you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. Xoopit uses
both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on
your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by
your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be
removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is
temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web
browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, some features of the Site may not function properly if the ability to
accept cookies is disabled.
</p>
<p>
<b>Log File Information:</b>
Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access
a web page. When you register with or view our site, our servers automatically
record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any
website. These server logs may include information such as your web request,
Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit
pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and
other such information.
</p>
<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>
We use the
personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the
features and functionality of the Site.
</p>
<h2>Emails and Content You Store on Xoopit and Automatically Recorded Information</h2>
<p>
Xoopit does not claim any
ownership in any of the content, including any text, data, information, images,
photographs, music, sound, video or other material that you upload, transmit or
store in you xoopit account. Such content will remain your private information.
Xoopit's servers will automatically scan and record certain information regarding
email accounts you load on Xoopit and your use of the Site—such as account
activity and other log information. The automatically recorded information
will be processed for various purposes, including formatting and displaying the
information you transmit via your emails. Such automatically recorded
information shall remain your private information and will not be made
available to the public.
</p>
<p>
<b>User-posted Information:</b>
Unlike the automatically scanned and recorded
information contained in any emails you send through the Site, which we agree
will remain your private information, any personal information or content that
you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Site (for instance, in the text,
data, photos, audio, video, images, graphics, links, logos, votes, and other content
or materials ("Materials") you post to public areas of the Site)
becomes available to the public.
</p>
<p>
By providing Xoopit your email
address you consent to our using the email address to send you Site-related
notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by
postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages,
including changes to features of the Site and special offers. If you do not
want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by sending an email
message to <a href="mailto:support@xoopit.com">support@xoopit.com</a> with the subject
"No email" or by
sending mail to the following postal address:
</p>
<blockquote>
Customer Support<br>
Xoopit, Inc.<br>
2711 18th Street, Suite 21<br>
San Francisco, CA 94110
</blockquote>
<p>
Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.
</p>
<p>
Xoopit may use certain information
about you and/or your Material without identifying you as an individual to
third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Site is used,
diagnosing Site or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing
advertisements and promotions.
</p>
<p>
We use cookies, and
log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to
re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide
custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of
our service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and
traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or
engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific
web company or ISP; and (f) help you efficiently access your information after
you sign in.
</p>
<h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
<p>
Your email address and name may be used when a User attempts to invite you via email to join Xoopit.
</p>
<h3>Personally Identifiable Information:</h3>
<p>
Xoopit will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others. Xoopit
may share your personally identifiable information with third parties solely
for the purpose of providing services to you. If we do this, such third
parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may
store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Xoopit
(for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).
</p>
<p>
We may transfer
information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.
In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject
to the promises made in our Privacy Policy or we would inform you before another
privacy policy is applied.
</p>
<p>
Except as otherwise described in
this privacy statement, Xoopit will not disclose personal information to any
third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that
such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process
served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action
regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of
Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves
against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement
agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to
exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Xoopit, our users
or others.
</p>
<h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</h3>
<p>
We
may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage
data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.)
with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for
certain Xoopit services.
</p>
<p>
In the future, Xoopit may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or
ad networks, to serve advertisements on the Xoopit site. These third-party ad
servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser,
the advertisements and links that appear on Xoopit. They automatically receive
your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such
as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their
advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.
</p>
<p>
Xoopit does not currently, and will not in the future, provide any personally
identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without
your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Xoopit to show an
advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-24) or audience
segment (for example, women ages 32-40 who have viewed certain channels of
content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may
conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
</p>
<p>
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers
or ad networks. The Xoopit privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot
control the activities of, such advertisers.
</p>
<p>
Xoopit
may also provide links to third-party websites, advertisers, and others. The Xoopit
privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of,
third-party websites. You should consult the privacy policy of any other website
you visit from links on the Xoopit site.
</p>
<h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
<h3>Security of the Personal Information</h3>
<p>We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational
measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and
from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot
guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those
measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You
acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.</p>
<h3>Compromise of Personal Information</h3>
<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a
breach of security, Xoopit will promptly notify those persons whose personal
information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification
procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by
applicable law.</p>
<h3>Notification Procedures</h3>
<p>It is the policy of Xoopit to provide notifications, whether such
notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business
related purposes, to our customers or web site users, via E-mail notice,
written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on
our web site page, <a href="http://www.xoopit.com">www.xoopit.com</a>, as
determined by Xoopit in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Xoopit reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing
notifications to our customers or web site users.</p>
<h2>Your Choices About Your Information</h2>
<p>
You may, of course, decline to
submit personally identifiable information through Xoopit, in which case Xoopit
may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct
your account information at any time by logging in to your account. You can
review and correct the information about you that Xoopit keeps on file by
contacting us directly at <a href="mailto:support@xoopit.com">support@xoopit.com</a>.
</p>
<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially
important. For that reason, Xoopit does not knowingly collect or solicit
personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such
persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not send any information
about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email
address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to
or on Xoopit. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal
information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent,
we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we
might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@xoopit.com">privacy@xoopit.com</a>.
</p>
<h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>
<p>
We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites
linked to or from our Web site nor the information or content contained
therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to
information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site.
</p>
<p>
Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Web
site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your
browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including Web sites which have
a link on our Web site, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies.
Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.
</p>
<h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post
those changes on our website to keep you aware of what information we collect,
how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. You are bound
by changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the site after those changes have
been posted.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions about
this Privacy Policy, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web
site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@xoopit.com">privacy@xoopit.com</a>.
