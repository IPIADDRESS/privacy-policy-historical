<h3>3. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h3>
<p>
A California resident who has provided Personal Information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purpose is
entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the
business has made such a disclosure of Personal Information, upon receipt of a request by a User, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom Personal
Information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed.
</p>
<p>
However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business maintains and adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a
policy of not disclosing customer’s Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless (1) the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure or
(2) the customer refrains from exercising an option that prevents the disclosure. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent
disclosure of Personal Information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.
</p>
<p>
As stated in this Privacy Policy, FANBREAD does not share Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you agree to such disclosure -- either by
opting in to receive information from such a third party, or choosing not to opt-out from receiving such information; provided, however, FANBREAD may track User activity once a User
has made a purchase through the FANBREAD WEBSITE and may, from time-to-time share generic (non-personally-identifiable) usage and purchasing data and information with third-parties,
in particular, credit card and billing information, and banking, account and related financial information used in connection with Payment Processing Services. To prevent disclosure
of your Personal Information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites, or, if
applicable, opt-out from such use. Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party or refrain from opting out from such sharing, your Personal
