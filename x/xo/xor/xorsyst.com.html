Anyone would have been fine (I dont care who I killed). I was tired of life&quot; - the words of the person who killed 7 people in Akihabara yesterday. UPDATE: The media have just found a post on the 2chan boards by somebody who said they were going to Akihabara to kill people with a truck and that they would use a knife if the truck got unusable - this post was made before the killings. UPDATE2: Photos of the killer at Japan Probe.  Its all over news in Japan and even across the world. The killer was Tomohiro Kato aged 25 who rented a 2 ton truck which he drove to Akihabara from Shizuoka which is situated 180 kilos from Tokyo. He drove at about 70 Kph into the main crossing at Akihabara which is pedestrianized on a Sunday and hit 3 people. One of the victims was vomiting huge amounts of blood while another lay on the ground with a twisted body. Kato stopped his truck and headed back to where the victims lay while stabbing 3 people on his way. When he got to the victims at the crossing, he got on top of one and stabbed them repeatedly. He also stabbed a police office her came to apprehend him. Kato then ran into the crowds and stated to stab more people. A total of 7 people died and another 10 injured - most of these people were stabbed from behind and it looks like one was stabbed in the neck. Witnesses said that Kato had a frenzy look on his face and that he looked like he was enjoying his killing spree. An officer chased Kato down an alley and tried to apprehend Kato with a stick. Kato started to scream and shout until the police officer pulled out his gun and said &quot;I'm going to shoot!&quot; where upon Kato collapsed to the ground and gave himself in. Killed in the incident was a woman aged 21, two men aged 19, 31, 47 and 74.  The police are still questioning him as to why he drove many miles to just to kill at Akihabara. The media have been digging into Kato's past to discover that he done well in school and was a sportsman. Apparently his father was a drunk who was violent to his mother. Kato also carried around a knife while at school. Full news report below  - news sources from todays TV, newspapers, 47News, Iza, JapanProbe etc. The person you see in the beige suit with glasses is the killer.   Am deeply saddened by the killings of innocent people who were out and about shopping and minding their own business - killings by a man who said &quot;Anyone would have been fine.&quot; [誰でもよかった] But the thing thats beginning to get really scary is that the &quot;Anyone would have been fine&quot; quote which has been uttered by previous killers. In January 2008, a boy aged 16 suddenly started to stab away at shoppers shouting &quot;KOROSHITE YARU!&quot; meaning &quot;Im going to kill you!&quot; Nobody died but had injuries to their arms and chest. The boy was arrested and later told police - &quot;Anyone would have been fine - I just wanted to kill everybody.&quot;  In March 2008, a boy of 18 pushed a man in front of a train who died from the impact. The boy later said &quot;If I killed somebody then I can go to jail - Anyone would have been fine.&quot; Also in March 2008 a man went around stabbing people in a train station where one person died. When he was caught he said &quot;Anyone would have been fine - I wanted to experience killing people.&quot; The worst thing about these killings is the &quot;just wanted to kill anybody&quot; factor with no other particular motive and that they happen in broad daylight on innocent people going about their business.  I used to remember when living in Hackney London - I used to have to always look behind my back when walking around at night. And then I came to Japan - the land where the crime rate is so low that a man sticking icecream in a post box made prime time news.  Am starting to think a lot about what Japanese society is coming to. How do you feel living in your region? Do you feel safe? Can you walk around at night without constantly looking behind your back? Do these indiscriminate killings of late change your views of Japan in anyway?

This pic of me and Kylie Minogue was taken in the late 80's/early 90's near the BBC studios. Hmmmm. Have not been to the BBC site for a while - like the design. Once I finish some DB work, I will make the top page of dannychoo.com a bit like the BBC site where you can drag and drop widgets to customize your top page.    My mate, Kylie and me at the Stock, Aitken and Waterman recording studios.    And knowing Kylie means that I get to know her sister Danni Minogue too. Danni in action below.      Danni was not as popular as Kylie at the time so was a bit more easier to meet up with. There were about 10 of us in a group who went around following Kylie, Danni, Sonia, Jason Donovan and other Stock Aitken n Waterman artists. Pics with Sonia and Jason are back in the UK. Some of Sonia in action below.   Jason in action below.   And the stuff hanging around me neck is a wad of backstage passes.     Me and Claudia Schiffer at Debenhams.    I and Danni at LWT studios. Danni's body guard would sometimes play games with us - he would stick Danni in the car and drive off at speed - we could get in our car and chase. The bodyguard would wait at the traffic lights when they where *green* and the drive through them when they were *red* thinking that we wouldn't follow - we followed all the time speeding through the oncoming cars from the left n right.    Together with Danni at her PR company at Picadilly. Pic of me handing her a prezzie.    With Danni at the airport. I is wearing a Mr Byrite top... Being a groupie at the time, we always found out where they were going to be and had connections on the inside and with the body guards too who would often give us backstage passes. I look back and think how it always has been a &quot;its about who you know&quot; which is especially true with Japanese businesses.    Me and Milla Jovovich outside her hotel.    Photos not in order ^^; Handing Claudia some flowers. Also got a load more photos back in the UK including pics with the cast of Beverly Hills 90210 etc - will grab them when I visit the UK next time. This was my life in the late 80's early 90's without the Internets. I seemed to have been able to make it through my teenage life without it but simply cant imagine life without the Internet now. Back then, if I wanted to watch anime or Japanese programs I had to take a bus to a bookshop to get them on VHS. If I wanted some health care material, I had to trek to the news agents and reach up to the top shelf. If I want to look up a Japanese word I needed to spend a few mins flicking through a dictionary. If I wanted to know what the population of Spain, I needed to either ask somebody or go to the library. Ever since I started to pick up the pace in blogging during 2005, the longest I've spent offline is 24 hours - any longer and I start to break out in a sweat ^^; Whats the longest time you've spent offline and do you think you could live without the Internets?

If it says &quot;1,000 yen&quot; then it means 1000 yen and usually wont be discounted. You can however get &quot;discounts&quot; in the form of point cards. The most generous point cards are for electrical stores like Bic Camera and Sakuraya. Sometimes they give up to 20% worth of the purchase price back on to your card - great for when you are buying expensive stuff. Simply put, if you spend 10,000 yen on something then you get to spend 2,000 yen on whatever you want on your next purchase. Anybody can make these cards even if you are a visitor to Japan. If you are buying electronic goods, bring along your passport too and you don't have to pay the consumption tax which is currently 5%. Point cards and passport = a *lot* of savings to be made which you can then spend on figures and stuff. Just out of interest, how much is the consumption tax in your region? I remember it being somthing like 17% when I lived in the UK.    But there are places where you can haggle for lower prices and thats at a place called Ameyo which I will talk about more in a later article. Here you see a seller flogging bags of snacks for 1000 yen. While this particular seller doesn't drop the price, you can haggle for more snacks to be put in the bag and if you want to be really tight fisted then you can ask for even moar - maybe wave the 1000 yen note at him or something.    The only experience I've had bargaining for lower prices is when I visit Penang Malaysia. It does get tiring though - for example I call a taxi but need to ask how much before I get on - if I don't then many taxi drivers say at the destination &quot;that will be two pints of blood or equivalent in cash.&quot; They usually start off at a ridiculous price and you have to bargain how much the ride will cost. have not been for a while so don't know what its like now. Whats it like in your region? Is bargaining for lower prices part of the custom? I guess it also depends on what is being bargained for?

Starting off with one of my favorite pastimes - driving on a sunny day on the highways above Tokyo listening to Ridge Racer tunes. Video I took a while ago with that RR tune.      BLT n Miku lunch. 960 yen at Jonathan's.    I'm getting old - forgot what this is called - bibimbap?  Do remember the price which was 760 yen.    Mc Dees do lovely icecream for 100 yen.    Fries go well with Spaghetti - 800 yen.    Many smokers in Japan carry around portable ashtrays. They look cool but I don't smoke and cant think of anything to put in it. Do folks carry around portable ashtrays in your region?    Hayashi curry lunch - 880 yen.    Want a new SLR and thinking of going for the Kiss2 with live preview functionality built in. Also want the GR Digital II compact camera as you can change lenses.     Many trains let you sit beside the driver but you have to be 6ft tall and weigh over 65 kilos for some reason. Before you get on, just press the yellow button next to the drivers seat which will measure your height and weight. If you qualify, the door will open and you can get in with the train driver.    Hearushi lunch - 1,200 yen.    Some bits n pieces from the pharmacy. Duster, deodorant and some refill for the anti-mosquito dome. For those who dont know, Japan has tons of mosquitoes as soon as it starts to get warm. Little blighters.    I dust down the office, polish the tables and vacuum the floor every two days as I cant concentrate on work knowing that theres dust all around. Besides - too much dust is bad for me asthma. How often is you being cleaning your room? Maybe you can post pictures of your room before and after cleaning in the Your Room category.     Figures are removed from the table and stuck in a corner for a while.    Cleaning done and figures back in place. One of my Ikea bulbs just went. Is it just me or are the lifespan of Ikea bulbs really short?    Some of Hectors desk also filled with SAFS.    The girls here also get a dusting down.    Dell server arrives. Will be used as a development server. The fans are so loud that it sounds like its going to take off.    We choose the linux based Ubuntu as the server which comes with PHP5 and MYSQL by default. Setting up a server from scratch (including installation) with Ubuntu took about an hour. The server will be taken to the server labs  tomorrow.    Chuka lunch - 800 yen.    Carrying around the PS2 version of Haruhi is tough because of the bits n pieces she has hanging off her.    There was some sort of ice festival in my local shoping arcade where animals were frozen for people to point and laugh at.    Another old lady laughs at this poor defenseless crab-kun.    Nothing better than clear roads on a sunny day in Tokyo. Vroom Vroom.    Been living in this area for about 3 years now and only discovered this Shotengai (shopping district) a few days ago by chance. It was incredibly weired as the entrance to this place is situated in a what seems like a deserted block of buildings. It was like a waking through that tunnel in Spirited Away. Spirited Away trailer below for those who have not seen it.      Kata Yakisoba - 460 yen. BTW - if you click on the prices, you are taken to the USD equivalent. If there is enough demand, I will make it so that you can set the currency too so you will get Pounds, Euros etc instead of USD for example.    This weeks Mc Dees goodies that come with the kids meal. Dragon ball for the boys and Cinnamoroll for the girls and the boys with high pitched voices.    Rush hour on the trains.    Now they are asking you to use your mobile phone at home only. What?    One for the girls - forgot the name of this group.    Umbrella parking.    Out n about in Tachikawa for meetings.    At the Kotobukiya offices going over some stuff.    If you are at a restaurant and get handed a bowl of what looks like droppings - grind it with the piece of wood that you are given.    If you dont grind quickly enough, they take away your wooden stick.    Once you have done your grinding, the pepper and sesame seeds is used to sprinkle on the main course.    Many menus hang on the wall like this.Folks who dont read the lingo can do what my gaijin friends do when they are in Tokyo - close eyes, point and let fate decide. Just hope fate does not choose some of this for you. Ah nearly forgot to mention - was just jesting about being able to sit next to the driver. If you really try to do so then you will probably be arrested.

First things first - meetings over lunch at the Indian restaurant run by Max Factory thats situated just below the Good Smile offices.      Then its back in the huge meeting room which has been transformed into a filming studio for the day. The office usually looks like this. Tis Mikatan taking pics of the setup.     Dont know what this is called but it looked like it was used to measure light and was most fascinating to watch - kinda looked like watching the Matrix.     Shooting the box opening sequence which took ages to get right. Commercials in Japan are known as &quot;CM&quot; and was wondering if the same term was used in your region too? Never heard the term when I was living in the UK or US though.     Shooting went on for pretty much the whole day and needed about 7 people full time on the cameras, lighting and editing.     A closer look at the desk where the Figma characters come to life in the stop motion action.     Figma Mikuru takes a break from the filming and plays with me instead ^^; Cant wait until shes released. Mikuru used to me my fave SOS dan member but am leaning towards Haruhi since I've acquired a load of her figures ^^; Your typa girl Haruhi or Mikuru?     I tease her by using the yellow pliers to tug on bits of her body.     Itsuki in the box but for some reason dont have much interest in playing with him ^^;     The box opening sequence continues...    The folks at Good Smile/Max Factory are perfectionists as you can tell with the high quality of their figures - getting that box opening sequence has to be perfect.     Editing is done on the MacBook Pro with Final Cut Pro.    Mikuru gets back to work.    And here is the schedule for the day.    Each scene of the commercial is sketched out like an econte. You previously saw some econte in this article.    And each scene is described in detail.    You can see the first commercial below.      And the second commercial with the whole cast below.      Good things happen to folks who do great things. This guy became popular for his stop motion videos that he uploaded to Nico Nico and was asked if he would do the stop motion that you see in the commercials.    This was a *very* slow process as the camera would run for a few seconds after each pose and then it was checked on the mac each time.
