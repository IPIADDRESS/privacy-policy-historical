You may interact with Xometry and provide us information through our software plug-ins, our online platform at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xometry.com/">www.xometry.com</a>&nbsp;(and all associated subdomains) (the “<b>Website</b>”), or by speaking with our employees and other representatives in support of your manufacturing project (collectively, the “<b>Services</b>”). Xometry (“<b>Xometry</b>” or “<b>we</b>” or “<b>us</b>”) has created this Privacy Policy to explain to you our privacy practices regarding the information we gather from you when you visit Website and utilize the Services.</p><p>This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any material changes in the way we use your personal data, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Website. &nbsp;Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Website. &nbsp;These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Services. &nbsp;Please note that at all times you are responsible for updating your personal data to provide us with your most current e-mail address. &nbsp;In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. &nbsp;If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your personal data, you must notify us prior to the effective date of the changes that you wish to deactivate your Account with us. &nbsp;Continued use of our Website or Services, following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.</p><p><b>What Information Do We Collect?</b></p><p>We collect information about you in various ways when you use our Website and Services.</p><p>Information You Provide</p><p>We collect the information you voluntarily provide to us. &nbsp;For example:</p><ul><li>We may collect personal information from you, such as your first and last name, email address, company name, job title and password when you create an account to log in to our network (“Account”).</li><li>When you order Services on our Website, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, billing information and shipping information.</li><li>We retain information on your behalf, such as specifications and engineering tolerances that you store using your Account.</li><li>If you provide us feedback or contact us via email, we will collect your name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to send you a reply.</li><li>In certain circumstances we may request that you provide us with photocopies of your ID and other related documents for fraud prevention purposes and to verify your identity.</li><li>When you participate in one of our surveys, we will collect the information you provide.</li><li>We may also collect personal information at other points on our Website that state that personal information is being collected.</li></ul><p>Information Collected Via Technology</p><p>We collect certain information automatically via various technological means. &nbsp;We collect information via technology in the following ways:</p><ul><li>Log Files. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. &nbsp;This information includes aggregate information on the pages customers access or visit (but not on which pages individual users visit), IP addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), operating systems, date/time stamp and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Website and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs.</li><li>Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small files that a website or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser that enables the website’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. &nbsp;We use cookies to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity and compile aggregate data about Website traffic and Website interaction so that we can offer better Website experiences and tools in the future. &nbsp;You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. &nbsp;You do this through your browser (e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, or Apple Safari) settings. &nbsp;Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookie preferences. &nbsp;If you turn cookies off, you won’t have access to many features that make your Website experience more efficient and some of our Services will not function properly. We use cookies only to record session information and to tailor marketing information and other services to you. &nbsp;We do not use cookies to obtain personally identifiable information.</li><li>Pixel Tags. In addition, we use&nbsp;<b>“Pixel Tags</b>” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). &nbsp;Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. &nbsp;In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer &nbsp;hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. &nbsp;Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. &nbsp;We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.</li></ul><p>Google Analytics. &nbsp;We use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Website. &nbsp;Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Website, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Website. &nbsp;We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Website and Services. &nbsp;Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Website, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. &nbsp;We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your personal data. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Website, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. &nbsp;Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Website is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.</p><p><b>How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</b></p><p>General Use.</p><p>In general, the personal information you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. &nbsp;We use your personal information in the following ways:</p><ul><li>Facilitate the creation of and secure your Account on our network;</li><li>Identify you as a user in our system;</li><li>When you create an Account, you will receive e-mail from us to verify ownership of the email address provided when your Account was created;</li><li>We may use your e-mail address information to provide you with administrative email notifications, such as order status information and updates;</li><li>Provide the Services you request;</li><li>Provide improved administration of our Website and Services;</li><li>Respond to your inquires and other requests;</li><li>For fraud protection and/or to verify your identity; and</li><li>Send newsletters, surveys, offers and other promotional materials related to our Services and for other marketing purposes of Xometry.</li></ul><p>User Testimonials. We often receive testimonials and comments from users who have had positive experiences with our Services. &nbsp;We occasionally publish such content. &nbsp;When we publish this content, we may identify our users by their first and last name and may also indicate their home city. &nbsp;We obtain the user’s consent prior to posting his or her name along with the testimonial.</p><p>Creation of Anonymous Data. &nbsp;We may create anonymous information records from your Specifications and any personal information we collect by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the information personally identifiable to you. &nbsp;We use this anonymous information to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Website and improve our Services, including our pricing algorithms. We reserve the right to use anonymous information for any purpose and disclose anonymous information to third parties at our sole discretion.</p><p><b>Do We Share Your Information With Any Third Parties?</b></p><p>We disclose your personal information as described below and as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</p><ul><li>Third Party Service Providers. &nbsp;We may share your personal information with third party service providers to: provide you with the Services that we offer you through our Website; to conduct quality assurance testing; to facilitate the creation of accounts; to provide technical support; and/or to provide other services to Xometry.</li><li>Manufacturing Partners. In order to manufacture the parts you order via the Services, Xometry may subcontract your manufacturing project to one of our manufacturing partners. &nbsp;As part of this process, we may share your information with our manufacturing partners to enable them to manufacture the parts, assemblies and other items disclosed therein.</li><li>Corporate Restructuring. &nbsp;We may share some or all of your personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, personal information may also be transferred as a business asset. &nbsp;If another company acquires our company, business or assets, that company will possess the personal information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding the personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</li><li>Other Disclosures. &nbsp;Regardless of any of the choices you make regarding your personal information (as described below), Xometry may disclose personal information if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary (a) in connection with any legal investigation; (b) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Xometry; (c) to protect or defend the rights of Xometry or users of the Website or Services; and/or (d) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use.</li></ul><p><b>Correction/Updating Personal Information</b></p><p>You can correct or update your personally identifiable information by re-registering or by contacting us by e-mail at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@xometry.com">support@xometry.com</a>&nbsp;or you can reach us by telephone at 240.252.1138.</p><p><b>Email Preferences</b></p><p>We will periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our Website or Services. &nbsp;When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive or by contacting us directly (please see contact information below).
