<h3>Online Behavioral Advertising</h3>
<strong>xosara.com</strong> uses OBA for several of its ad blocks.
OBA is based on a set of principles encouraging consumer-friendly standards in
online advertising such as educating the user about the ads he will see,
transparency in regards to their placement and data security for the user browsing
our web pages. The Advertising Networks that we use adhere to these standards as well.
<h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
Our Online Behavioral Advertising compliant partners might use cookies and web
beacons through their ads. Cookies are small text files that are placed in the
visitor's computer with the purpose of storing their preferences. Cookies cannot
damage user files, nor can they read information from a user's hard drive,
they are purely "shortcuts" that allow websites to remember users activities on
a web site as well as users visits to a site. Since we use third party
advertisements to support <strong>xosara.com</strong> , there is a chance
the companies running these ads might store your data in cookies, in order to
collect advertisement information or to protect you from abusive advertising
(for example, stopping pop-up scripts from running multiple times from your IP).
Because these advertising companies may also collect the personal information,
we at <strong>xosara.com</strong> make sure we only use
trustworthy 3rd parties, in order to protect our users.
<strong>xosara.com</strong> is displaying advertisements on the game pages,
ads from Google Adsense, ValueClick Media, CPM Star and other advertising vendors.
Google offers child safe targeted ads to our users. Google is also using the
DART cookie to collect information about every user. This cookie does not store
any personal data or sensitive information and can be removed by you searching
the cookie in the cookies folder of your browser on your PC. If you as a parent
or as a user find ads that are not appropriate for children please notify us at once.
In general, these cookies and web beacons are used for research purposes and for
geo-targeting and behavioral targeting of the ads. If you feel uncomfortable
providing this kind of information to our advertisers through cookies, you can
turn them off from your preferred browser's settings, or manage them through
Internet Security software (such as Norton Internet Security for example).
<h3>External Links</h3>
Our site has several external links pointing to our partners, or the flash games
we post on our site might have in-game links to other sites that might offer content
that we have no control over. Unfortunately, we cannot take responsibility for
the content shown by our partners, although we only pick to link to related,
quality websites that are non-intrusive and offer clean content suitable for our
target audience. <br><br>
Advertising on <strong>xosara.com</strong> offers advertisement places in several places
across the website. These ad spots show Google Adsense Ads, ValueClick Media or
other ads and are child friendly. If you wish to advertise on our website,

can be targeted for advertising or email us at:<br> <span class="contact"></span>
<h3>Opt out Mechanism</h3>
All sites using advertisements provided by companies that adhered to the Network
Advertising Initiative (NAI) must provide an opt-out button that will allow users
to no longer receive online advertising. In order to opt out from the advertisements
