Finally we may receive, collect or generate information about you through the use and operation of our Digital Properties, including without limitation data about your activities within our Digital Properties, data regarding usage of our Services, reservations made, products and services requested or purchased, your IP address, browser type, ISP, page views, clicks, domains, operating systems, device IDs, device types and similar information.
