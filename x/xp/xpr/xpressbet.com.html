<p>Like many other web sites You may visit, the Site automatically collects certain non-personal information regarding You, such as the date and time You access the Site, the Internet address of the web site from which You linked to the Site, the operating system You are using, and the Site pages read and images viewed. This non-personal information is used for system administration purposes and to improve the Site. Non-personal information may be disclosed to other persons and permanently archived for future use. The Site also uses "cookies", a technology that installs a small data file onto Your browser from a web server which is then stored on Your computer's hard drive, which thereafter permits the Site to recognize future visits from that computer. Cookies do not damage Your system or impair its functioning in any way. Xpressbet uses cookies to tailor and enhance Your experience at the Site, to show You content that You might be interested in, and to display the content according to Your preferences. Cookies do not contain any personal identifying information and only contain information such as a user ID that a web site uses to track the pages You have visited. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information You supply Yourself. A cookie cannot read data off Your hard disk or read cookie files created by other web sites. We use cookies to track users traffic patterns when You make any requests for Xpressbet services. When You make Your request, we may use a cookie to store a unique, random user ID. We use this ID to identify You anonymously in our database and to track the pages You visit on the Site. You can reset Your browser to refuse all cookies or to allow Your browser to show You when a cookie is sent.</p>

<h1>SECURITY</h1>

<p>At the time of Your request for access to Your personal information, we will need specific information to verify Your identity before we can provide You with the personal information requested. In some instances, we will not be able to provide You with the personal information You request, for instance where that information (i) contains references to other persons, (ii) has been destroyed due to legal requirements or because the information has served its purposes, or (iii) is subject to legal protections that prevent disclosure (e.g. information this is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege). If we are unable to provide You with access to Your personal information, we will explain why and advise You as to any recourse available to You.</p>
<p>We are committed to maintaining the accuracy of Your personal information, and we encourage You to notify us of inaccuracies or corrections. Timely notification of a change of address or telephone number helps us in providing You with the best possible service. You may change Your personal information in our records at any time and as often as necessary.
