  XpressBet ("MEC") respects your individual privacy. This privacy
  policy (the "Privacy Policy") embodies our commitment to its protection
  through adherence to fair electronic information practices. This Privacy Policy
  puts You in control of how your personal information is processed. You have
  our promise that we will not electronically process your personal information
  in any way that is incompatible with this Privacy Policy. </p>
              <p><strong>Collection and Use of Personal Information</strong> </p>
              <p>We use information about You for purposes of monitoring and
                improving our internal operations, as well as to ensure we (i)
                bill You properly, (ii) administer your Account in accordance
                with your agreements with us, (iii) properly perform the services
                You have requested, and (iv) comply with applicable state and
                federal laws and regulations. </p>
              <p>We also use the information we collect to monitor and improve
                our internal operations, as well as to improve the experience
                of users in our network of web sites. For example, we may correlate
                Web Site traffic information with data about individual users.
                This data helps us to determine how much our customers use parts
                of this Web Site, allowing us to enhance it to fit the needs
                of as many of our customers as possible. We may also break down
                overall usage statistics according to customers' domain names,
                browser types, and MIME types by reading this information from
                the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). </p>
              <p>MEC owns and operates this Web Site. MEC does not collect personal
                information about You except when You provide it to MEC on a
                voluntary basis. Personal information is collected from You at
                this Web Site when You complete a survey, request to be notified
                or request information, products or services. The personal information
                collected by MEC includes your name, address, e-mail address,
                profile data and other demographic information (including your
                zip code, age, gender or income level). Your contact information
                is used to contact You when necessary. It is also used to identify
                what future products or services You may require. All information
                remains within MEC and its affiliates and is not sold to other
                companies. </p>
              <p>We use the information we collect to direct important notices
                and information affecting your Account or services on this Web
                Site as well as to provide general information that may be of
                interest to You which may include newsletters, surveys, contest
                announcements, and information about our service or product offerings
                or the offerings of our business affiliates. You may opt-out
                of receiving information from us simply by notifying us by writing
                to the Director of Operations, 200 Race Track Road, Building 26, Washington,
                PA 15301 or by e-mailing us at <a href="contact.aspx"><font size="2">customerservice@xpressbet.com</font></a>                or in accordance with the opt-out instructions contained in any
                information message You receive from us. Note, however, that
                in order to fulfill our service obligations to You, we must continue
                sending You notices and other important information affecting
                your Account or services. </p>
              <p>MEC reserves the right to provide Your personal information
                to a company or individual employed by MEC to perform functions
                on its behalf, to another company or person for the development,
                enhancement, marketing or provision of MEC’s products or
                services, to an agent or third party retained by MEC in connection
                with MEC’S administration or the provision of MEC’s
                products or services or an agent used by MEC to evaluate Your
                creditworthiness or to collect Your Account. If MEC provides
                Your personal information to a third party then that third party
                will be subject to the highest level of confidentiality with
                respect to Your personal information. </p>
              <p>We destroy customer information that is no longer necessary
                for the purpose for which it is collected unless there is a legitimate
                request or order to inspect the information still outstanding
                or the information remains in routine records that are periodically
                discarded under our document retention policies. The information
                You have provided us is maintained in our management information
                system and billing systems, and is updated as new information
                is added. Accounting and billing records are retained for ten
                years for tax and accounting purposes or until the relevant income
                tax years for which the document was created have been closed
                for income tax purposes and/or all appeals have been exhausted.
                Records may remain on file even after You have terminated Your
                Account. Subject to applicable law, we may also keep records
                to facilitate collection and to evaluate credit worthiness. </p>

                You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal

              <p><strong>Security</strong> </p>
              <p>MEC will maintain security measures in place in order to attempt
                to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the personal
                information under our control. All data is kept on secure database
                servers kept separately from the webservers, which are all behind
                a firewall with very restrictive access. This Web Site uses 128-bit
                encryption for all secure links, which adheres to federal and
                international guidelines for secure server transactions. </p>
              <p>All data entry is done via a secure interface that provides
                no export facility. Please be advised, however, that the Internet
                and other various networking communication mediums are not secure,
                unless explicitly specified as such, and may be subject to interception
                or loss which is beyond the control of MEC. Also be advised that
                the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information

                cannot be guaranteed. </p>
              <p>MEC will not monitor, edit or deliberately disclose the contents
                of your private communications or files, however, in circumstances
                where we inadvertently obtain information that appears to pertain
                to the commission of a crime or where we reasonably believe that
                an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical
                injury to any person exists, MEC may voluntarily disclose the
                record or the contents of your communications or other information
                about you to law enforcement agencies and governmental entities
                without providing you advance notice. Upon receipt of an applicable
                search warrant or administrative, grand jury or trail subpoena,
                MEC may be required to disclose to the government or law enforcement
                agencies, without advance notice to you, the content of your
                communications and other records relating to your electronic
                communications, as well as the following records: your name and
                address; records of your online communications (including session
                times and duration); how long you have subscribed to our service(s)
                (including start date) and the type(s) of service(s) utilized;
                your telephone number or other subscriber account identifying
                number(s), including any Internet or network address(es) assigned
