This Privacy Policy was last updated on October 15, 2003. 

<br><br>

XpressBet ("MEC") respects your individual privacy. This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") embodies our commitment to its 
protection through adherence to fair electronic information practices. This Privacy Policy puts You in control of how your 
personal information is processed. You have our promise that we will not electronically process your personal information in 
any way that is incompatible with this Privacy Policy. 

<br><br>

<b>COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b>

<br><br>

We use information about You for purposes of monitoring and improving our internal operations, as well as to ensure we (i) 
bill You properly, (ii) administer your Account in accordance with your agreements with us, (iii) properly perform the 
services You have requested, and (iv) comply with applicable state and federal laws and regulations. 

We also use the information we collect to monitor and improve our internal operations, as well as to improve the experience of 
users in our network of web sites. For example, we may correlate Web Site traffic information with data about individual 
users. This data helps us to determine how much our customers use parts of this Web Site, allowing us to enhance it to fit the 
needs of as many of our customers as possible. We may also break down overall usage statistics according to customers' domain 
names, browser types, and MIME types by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every 
user's browser). 

MEC owns and operates this Web Site. MEC does not collect personal information about You except when You provide it to MEC on 
a voluntary basis. Personal information is collected from You at this Web Site when You complete a survey, request to be 
notified or request information, products or services. The personal information collected by MEC includes your name, address, 
e-mail address, profile data and other demographic information (including your zip code, age, gender or income level). Your 
contact information is used to contact You when necessary. It is also used to identify what future products or services You 
may require. All information remains within MEC and its affiliates and is not sold to other companies. 

We use the information we collect to direct important notices and information affecting your Account or services on this Web 
Site as well as to provide general information that may be of interest to You which may include newsletters, surveys, contest 
announcements, and information about our service or product offerings or the offerings of our business affiliates. You may 
opt-out of receiving information from us simply by notifying us by writing to the Director of Operations, 200 Race Track Road, 
Building 26, Washington, PA 15301 or by e-mailing us at<a href="mailto:customerservice@xpressbet.com"> 
customerservice@xpressbet.com</a> or in accordance with the opt-out instructions contained in any information message You 
receive from us. Note, however, that in order to fulfill our service obligations to You, we must continue sending You notices 
and other important information affecting your Account or services. 

MEC reserves the right to provide Your personal information to a company or individual employed by MEC to perform functions on 
its behalf, to another company or person for the development, enhancement, marketing or provision of MEC’s products or 
services, to an agent or third party retained by MEC in connection with MEC’S administration or the provision of MEC’s 
products or services or an agent used by MEC to evaluate Your creditworthiness or to collect Your Account. If MEC provides 
Your personal information to a third party then that third party will be subject to the highest level of confidentiality with 
respect to Your personal information. 

We destroy customer information that is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it is collected unless there is a 
legitimate request or order to inspect the information still outstanding or the information remains in routine records that 
are periodically discarded under our document retention policies. The information You have provided us is maintained in our 
management information system and billing systems, and is updated as new information is added. Accounting and billing records 
are retained for ten years for tax and accounting purposes or until the relevant income tax years for which the document was 
created have been closed for income tax purposes and/or all appeals have been exhausted. Records may remain on file even after 
You have terminated Your Account. Subject to applicable law, we may also keep records to facilitate collection and to evaluate 
credit worthiness. 

A "cookie" is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. 
Cookies do not damage your system or impair its functioning in any way. MEC uses cookies to tailor and enhance your experience 
at this Web Site, to show You content that You might be interested in, and to display the content according to your 
preferences. Cookies do not contain any personal identifying information and only contain information such as a user ID that a 
web site uses to track the pages You have visited. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information You 
supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other web sites. We use cookies 
to track users traffic patterns when You make any requests for MEC services. When You make your request, we may use a cookie 
to store a unique, random user ID. We use this ID to identify You anonymously in our database and to track the pages You visit 
on this Web Site. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to allow your browser to show You when a cookie is sent. 

<br><br>

<br><br>

<b>SECURITY </b>

<br><br>

MEC will maintain security measures in place in order to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the

all information and data exchanged between You and MEC through this Web Site cannot be guaranteed. 

<br><br>

MEC will not monitor, edit or deliberately disclose the contents of your private communications or files, however, in 
circumstances where we inadvertently obtain information that appears to pertain to the commission of a crime or where we 
reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person exists, MEC 
may voluntarily disclose the record or the contents of your communications or other information about you to law enforcement 
agencies and governmental entities without providing you advance notice. Upon receipt of an applicable search warrant or 
administrative, grand jury or trail subpoena, MEC may be required to disclose to the government or law enforcement agencies, 
without advance notice to you, the content of your communications and other records relating to your electronic 
communications, as well as the following records: your name and address; records of your online communications (including 
session times and duration); how long you have subscribed to our service(s) (including start date) and the type(s) of 
service(s) utilized; your telephone number or other subscriber account identifying number(s), including any Internet or 
network address(es) assigned to you by our network; and means and source of your payment(s) (including any credit card or bank 
account number).
