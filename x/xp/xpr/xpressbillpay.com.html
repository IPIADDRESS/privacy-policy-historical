In no event, shall the Company be liable for the Client’s use or disclosure of such information.

              Each of the Clients has access to information specific only to that Client’s customers. Each Client will determine what it will do with the collected information; however, each Client has individually agreed to abide by this Privacy Policy and the Company’s Terms of Use.
              <br><br>
              Notice is hereby given that a Client such as a city may ask you to provide information that could be classified as a private or controlled record.&nbsp; The city is requesting this information in order to assist in processing your payment. &nbsp;Failure or refusal to provide this information may result in the city’s inability to process your payment.

We may also release personally identifiable information when we believe release is appropriate to: 1) comply with the law, and/or 2) protect the rights, property or safety of the Company, our users, or others.

We use cookies to improve the quality of our service and your experience on the Site by storing your preferences and tracking user trends. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent if you wish. Some Site features and services will not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

              In the event that your sensitive personal information is accessed by an unauthorized individual and the misuse of your information is reasonably possible, we will notify you of the unauthorized access unless a law enforcement agency believes that such notification may interfere with a criminal investigation. Notification of such an event may be given to you by e-mail, writing, or phone at our sole discretion.
