<p>Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Because we gather certain types of information about the users of The X PRIZE Foundation website, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, and how we use it.</p>

<p>Questions regarding this statement should be directed to The X PRIZE Foundation.</p>

<p><em>Information The X PRIZE Foundation gathers and tracks</em><br>
The X PRIZE Foundation gathers two types of information about users: data that users provide through optional, voluntary registration on several sections of our site and in certain contests; and data The X PRIZE Foundation gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our site.</p>

<p>Such information enables us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help potential advertisers better understand the demographics of our audience.</p>

<p>The X PRIZE Foundation does not divulge information about an individual user to any third party.</p>

<p>The X PRIZE Foundation gathers user information in the following processes:</p>

<p>Optional registration</p>

<p>Several The X PRIZE Foundation sites offer free, voluntary registration to users for email web site updates. During registration the user is required to supply an email address only.</p>

<p>Polling</p>

<p>The The X PRIZE Foundation site may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what the The X PRIZE Foundation audience thinks about important issues. The X PRIZE Foundation uses a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.</p>

<p>Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)</p>

<p>The The X PRIZE Foundation offers a free electronic newsletter to users. The X PRIZE Foundation gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list through the subscription management pages.</p>

<p>The X PRIZE Foundation delivers newsletters, marketing and product offerings via e-mail to only registered recipients from our subscription center. The email tracking system recognizes the URL that was clicked, and records some information about your computer, such as the browser, operatingsystem and IP address.</p>

<p><em>Usage tracking</em><br>
The X PRIZE Foundation tracks user traffic patterns through our site.</p>

<p>The X PRIZE Foundation sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter on our site, but this tracking is never associated with individual users.</p>

<p><em>Use of the information</em><br>
The X PRIZE Foundation uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience on our site, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the site or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.</p>

<p>As stated above, The X PRIZE Foundation uses information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (daily or weekly, depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. The X PRIZE Foundation never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers or partners.</p>

<p>When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. The X PRIZE Foundation does not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.</p>

<p>We track search terms entered in The X PRIZE Foundation's search engine as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters. The X PRIZE Foundation creates aggregrate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs.</p>

<p><em>Opt-out policy</em><br>
The X PRIZE Foundation gives users options wherever necessary and practical.</p>

<p>Opting not to provide certain personal information when registering or when participating in some contests (see above)</p>

<p>Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information from our users.</p>

<p><em>Correct/update policy</em><br>
</p><p>Users may change this information at any time and as often as necessary. Users who are experiencing problems or who have any questions about how our services work can contact the webmaster.</p>

<p><em>Delete/deactivate policy</em><br>
Users may unsubscribe to our electronic newsletter at any time.</p>
