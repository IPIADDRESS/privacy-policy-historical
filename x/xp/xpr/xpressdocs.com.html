			<p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at <span class="company">xpressdocs</span>´ website. Here are the types of information we gather.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Information you or your company give us:</strong> We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future ordering for you, improving our service, and communicating with you.</li>
    				<li><strong>Automatic information:</strong> We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use ´cookies,´ and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses <span class="company">xpressdocs</span>´ website. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at <span class="company">xpressdocs</span>´ website if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.</li>
			     <li><strong>E-mail communications:</strong> To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we might receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from <span class="company">xpressdocs</span>´ website if your computer supports such capabilities.  If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please contact us and let us know.</li>
			     <li><strong>Information from other sources:</strong> We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. Depending on the level of integration, your information might have been supplied by integration with your company´s intranet system, intranet provider´s system, or might have been supplied as raw data from one or more of these sources with prior authorization from the company.</li>

			<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide various features within the system. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, we cannot guarantee that your browsing and shopping experience will be optimal, or functional for that matter, so we suggest you at the least accept cookies originating from our website.</p>

			<a name="03"></a><h2>Does <span class="company">xpressdocs</span>´ website share the information it receives?</h2>
			<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Financial processing:</strong> We use <a href="http://www.authorize.net" rel="external">Authorize.net</a> for our credit card processing – a well recognized and reputable financial processing company.  Information required to process a credit card transaction is securely transmitted to <a href="http://www.authorize.net" rel="external">Authorize.net</a> (for example, Name, Address, Credit Card Number, etc) for payment authorization and processing.  For information on their security and privacy policies, please visit their website at <a href="http://www.authorize.net" rel="external">www.authorize.net</a>.</li>
				<li><strong>Agents and customer service:</strong>  We do not employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  This means that when you contact <span class="company">xpressdocs</span> (either via phone or email) you will be communicating with an employee of <span class="company">xpressdocs</span> – bound by the conditions listed in this privacy notice.</li>

			<p><br></p>

			<a name="04"></a><h2>How secure is information about me?</h2>
			<p>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to <a href="http://www.authorize.net" rel="external">Authorize.net</a> during order processing.</p>
<p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer, or close the browser window.</p>

			<a name="05"></a><h2>Which information can I access?</h2>
			<p><span class="company">xpressdocs</span>´ website gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with <span class="company">xpressdocs</span>´ website for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.</p>

			<a name="06"></a><h2>What choices do I have?</h2>
			<p>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of <span class="company">xpressdocs</span>´ website features and services.</p>
			<p>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please contact us, and we will ensure that you are not contacted.

If you have any concern about privacy at <span class="company">xpressdocs</span>´ website, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.</p>
			<p>Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Policy will change also.
