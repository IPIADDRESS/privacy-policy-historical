<p><strong>Your Acceptance</strong></p>
<p>By using our site, you signify your agreement to the privacy policies described herein. If you do not agree with our privacy policies, please do not use our site or service. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our site or we will email you at our discretion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>We respect and safeguard the privacy of every individual who visits our website. This Privacy Policy is a formal document that outlines the information which may be collected about you while you use our site, and how that information may be used. This Policy will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want your personal information collected or shared when you visit our site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Personal Identifying Information</strong></p>
<p>We will not collect any personal identifying information about you (including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, Social Security number, bank account or credit card information, or any combination of data that could be used to identify you, such as birth date, zip code, and gender) unless you provide it to us voluntarily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not want your personal identifying information collected, please do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted this information and would like for us to remove it from our records, please contact us at the email address listed at the bottom of this Policy. We will use reasonable efforts to delete your information from our existing files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you do provide us with personal identifying information, such information will be gathered solely by us, and is for use solely by us and our trusted partners. At any point where personal identifying information is requested, any information that is optional to provide, rather than mandatory, will be clearly marked as such. We may use personal identifying information in the following ways, unless stated otherwise: we may store and process that information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services; and we may use that information to contact you. Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for registration and to bill the user for products and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may utilize electronic newsletters to reach all or a subset of all registered users, using the email address collected. Users may remove themselves from such mailing lists at any time by following the instructions that shall be sent as part of any of such mailings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may request personal identifying information on specific pages that allow users to contact us. Such information is being collected to assist us in solving a specific issue addressed by the user and/or to allow us to contact the user with an appropriate response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a limited number of situations where we may disclose your personal information to others without first receiving your consent: (1) when legally ordered to do so by a lawful subpoena or court order, (2) if you violate or breach an agreement with us, (3) if we believe conduct by you will harm our property or rights or those of our customers or models, (4) under exigent circumstances to protect the physical safety of our site, its employees, users or the general public, (5) in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of our company’s assets or the sale of an entire web site or business division or (6) in order to validate credit card numbers for charging for fee services.</p>
