<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xpango are committed to protecting your privacy. We hope the   following  privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") will help you understand   how we  collect and protect the personal information you provide to us    when registering with the Xpango.com web site (the "Site") and by Xpango   Ltd. </p>
<p>We are committed to making your use of the Site easy and    enjoyable as possible. Please take a moment to read the following    Privacy Policy to determine how your personal information will be    treated as you make full use of our offers. <br>
  <br>
  By using the Site,  or providing the information requested by the   Site, or by continuing to  use the Site after having an opportunity to   review this Privacy Policy,  you agree to accept the terms of our   Privacy Policy and our use of the  information we collect. If you do not   agree to the terms of this  Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site. </p>
<p>Xpango Ltd reserves the right to modify this Privacy  Policy at   any time without giving you prior notice. Your use of the  Site   following any such modification constitutes your agreement to be  bound   by this Privacy Policy as modified. The last date this Privacy  Policy   was revised or modified is set forth below ("Effective Date"). </p>
<p>I. What personally identifiable information does Xpango.com collect from me and how does Xpango.com use my  information? </p>
<p>To create an account, we collect your name, email address, and  a   shipping address. We also collect a password that you create, which    you may change  in the 'My Account' page of our site. We will initially   use this information  to set up your account, to send you a registration   confirmation email  and to log your shipping information so that we   know where to send your  order. </p>
<p>Referral emails that you initiate from the "Refer Friends"  page   of your Xpango.com account will be sent out by Xpango.com on  your   behalf and will either display your email address or that of    "support@xpango.com" in the email "From" field. Referral email addresses    are only used to deliver user-initiated communications. Xpango.com    will not collect and use these referral email addresses for any other    purpose or manner. </p>
<p>Although  Xpango.com may have independently received similar   information  from your use of the Site, Xpango.com does not have access   to  any additional information that you provide on a third party hosted    site (i.e. if you complete an offer such as Blockbuster.com, Xpango do   not have access to the information you submit to Blockbuster). <br>
  <br>
  All information provided to our third party business partners is    subject to the posted privacy policies of our third party business    partners. </p>
<p>When you place an order, your shipping information is sent to a    vendor who will fulfill and ship your product(s). Our suppliers will    also safeguard your personal information and are contractually    prohibited from disclosing your personal information to other parties    for any reason. They will not have access to any referral information    you provide. </p>
<p>II. Completing 3rd Party Offers to gain Credits with Xpango.com </p>
<p>Our goal is to deliver offers to customers who we believe will    find them of value. Offers are developed and managed under strict    conditions designed to safeguard the security and privacy of customer    personal information. When you click on an offer, you will be    redirected to that advertiser's site. An instruction box will appear    explaining to which offer you are being redirected. Although the site    may still display a Xpango.com address on the landing page, you  are in   fact on a third party offer provider's website, and any  information you   submit will be transmitted to this third party. </p>
<p>As a member of the Site, we will be sending transactional  emails   for various reasons as you continue to use our site. For  example, a   welcome email will be sent thanking you for joining, or an  email   telling you an order has shipped, etc. These emails are required  for   logistical purposes and users cannot opt-out of these types of  emails. </p>
<p>If you contact Xpango.com, we may keep a record of that    correspondence. Wherever Xpango.com collects personal  information, we   make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy  on that   specified page. </p>
<p>With your consent, Xpango.com may from time to time send    commercial e-mails with additional Xpango offers and information about   New gifts available from Xpango.  Xpango.com is committed to ethical and   responsible e-mail  practices. Accordingly, Xpango.com strives to make   sure that all  commercial e-mails sent by Xpango.com are compliant with   the  Can-Spam Act of 2003. Members may opt-out of receiving promotional    mailings by clicking on the opt-out link contained in the body of any    commercial e-mail sent by Xpango.com or by unsubscribing from    commercial e-mail by logging into your Member account on  Xpango.com,   clicking on the unsubscribe link and entering the  e-mail address that   you wish to unsubscribe from further commercial  e-mail messages from   Xpango.com. </p>
<p>Please note that we can only allow one account per household.    This rule exists to protect our advertising partners, as it serves to    engender high quality, unique leads. Potential users who reside in    households with multiple people are recommended to share an account. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you take  advantage of an offer   from a Xpango.com business partner and  thus, become their customer,   they may independently wish to send offers  to you. In the event that   you are not interested in receiving future  offers from these   affiliates, you must contact them directly to fulfill  your list removal   request. </p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable    information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is    necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial    proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site. If your    personally identifiable information changes, you may update it by    making the necessary edits by logging into your account at Xpango.com   and clicking on the 'Edit My Details' link. </p>
<p>To deactivate an account, please contact Customer Service directly with this request. </p>
<p>II.  What are cookies and how does Xpango.com use them? </p>
<p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by    your browser on your computer's hard drive. Xpango.com uses  cookies to   better understand your traffic patterns on the Site as well  as keeping   your login information securely stored. This information  helps us   improve the navigation and flow of the web site. Additionally  this may   allow users who choose to be remembered when they come back to  the Site   to be automatically logged in. We link cookies to personally    identifiable information so that we may track your activities on the    Site in order to credit you for completing a third party offer. Most Web   browsers  automatically accept cookies, but if you choose to disable   the use of  cookies, you will run the risk of not receiving proper   credit for  completing an offer. Some of our business partners (e.g.,    advertisers/offer providers) may use cookies on our site. We have no    access to or control over these types of cookies. </p>
<p>III.  Who is collecting information? </p>
<p>When you are on a Site and are asked for personal information,    you are sharing that information with Xpango.com, unless it is    specifically stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy or in a 3rd party   offer  that you may be asked to complete as  part of utilizing the   service. </p>
<p>Please be aware that Xpango.com partners, advertisers  and web   sites that have links on our site may collect personally  identifiable   information about you. The information practices of those  Internet   access partners, advertisers, and web sites linked from  Xpango.com are   not covered by this Privacy Policy.  Xpango.com has no liability or   responsibility for these  independent policies or the use of any   personally identifiable  information you independently transfer to these   companies. </p>
<p>IV.  With whom does Xpango.com share my information? </p>
<p>As set forth in Section I, Xpango.com may submit your  personal   information to third party business partners to participate in  their   offer or survey. Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy  Policy,   Xpango.com will <strong>NOT</strong> disclose any of your personally  identifiable information . </p>
<p>b. Other: Xpango.com may also disclose account  information in   special cases when we have reason to believe that  disclosing this   information is necessary to identify, contact or bring  legal action   against someone who may be violating Xpango.com's  policies or may be   causing injury to or interference with (either  intentionally or   unintentionally) Xpango.com's rights or  property, other Xpango.com   users, or anyone else that could be  harmed by such activities.   Xpango.com may disclose or access  account information when we believe   in good faith that the law requires  it and for administrative and other   purposes that we deem necessary to  maintain, service, and improve our   products and services. Lastly,  Xpango.com may disclose a users e-mail   address as part of a  suppression file or do-not-e-mail list to its   partners and affiliates  to make sure that a users unsubscribe requests   are forwarded to the  appropriate parties to ensure removal of the user   from partner and  affiliate databases in compliance with law, including   without  limitation, the Can-Spam Act of 2003. </p>
<p>c. Acquisitions. As Xpango.com develops, we may buy  other   businesses or their assets or sell our business assets. Customer    information is generally one of the business assets involved in such    transactions. Thus, in the event that Xpango.com or all of its  assets   are acquired, customer information, including any visitor  information   collected through the Site, would be one of the transferred  assets. </p>
<p>V.  What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information? </p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We    follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal    information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we    receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or    method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we    strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal    information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>
<p>Account information for Xpango.com members are    password-protected so that you and only you have access to this    personal information. You may edit your Xpango.com account  information   by logging into your Member account on Xpango.com,  clicking on the   'Edit My Details' link and update your personal information. </p>
<p>We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.    Xpango.com will never ask you for your password in an  unsolicited phone   call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to  sign out of your   Xpango.com account and close your browser  window when you have finished   your session. This is to ensure that others  cannot access your   personal information and correspondence if you share  a computer with   someone else or are using a computer in a public place  like a library. </p>
<p>VI.  Miscellaneous Provisions. </p>
<p>a. Disclaimer of Liability. Under no circumstances shall    Xpango.com be liable for any damages, including, but not limited  to,   indirect, special, incidental, consequential or exemplary damages,  that   result from the use of the information or materials posted to or    collected as a result of the user's accessing the Site or use of the    service provided by Xpango.com, even if Xpango.com has  been advised of   the possibility of such damages. </p>
<p>b. Enforcement/Redress. If for some reason you believe that    Xpango.com has not adhered to this Privacy Policy, please notify    Customer Service and they will endeavor to respond to your concerns    and, when appropriate, take steps to correct a problem. </p>
<p>c. Security of the Data Collected. The Site is not a secure web    site. Xpango.com cannot and does not ensure or warrant the  security of   any information collected by use, transmitted over the  Internet, or   maintained in your user profile. You agree that any data  transmission   you make or receive through the Site is at your own risk. </p>
