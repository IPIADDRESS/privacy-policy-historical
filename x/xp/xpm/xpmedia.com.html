<h2>REVISIONS</h2>
<p>XPMEDIA.COM INC. MAY REVISE THIS PRIVACY POLICY, THE ONLINE TERMS OF USE AND ANY OTHER POLICIES AND AGREEMENTS AT ANY TIME BY UPDATING THIS POSTING. YOU SHOULD VISIT THIS PAGE FROM TIME TO TIME TO REVIEW THE THEN CURRENT TERMS BECAUSE THEY ARE BINDING ON YOU. YOUR USE OF THIS WEBSITE AFTER SUCH CHANGES ARE IMPLEMENTED CONSTITUTES YOUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF THESE CHANGES.&nbsp; CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS MAY BE SUPERSEDED BY EXPRESSLY DESIGNATED TERMS LOCATED ON PARTICULAR PAGES OF THIS WEBSITE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy covers XPmedia.com Inc and its website:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>XPmedia.com's website can be accessed at <a href="http://www.xpmedia.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.xpmedia.com</a>.&nbsp; By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of your information by XPmedia.com as set forth in the Privacy Policy currently in effect. If we decide to change our policy, such changes will be posted here on the website. Please check back periodically to ensure that you have read the most current policy. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Location of Data</h2>
<p>XPMedia is based in the United States. We provide services globally using computer systems, servers, and databases located in the U.S. When you use our services from outside of the U.S., your information will therefore be transferred to, stored in, and processed in the U.S. Data is collected, stored, used, and shared as set forth in our privacy policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>European Users</h2>
<p>The European Commission has determined that the transfer of personal information of its residents outside of Europe must be subject to a legal framework that adequately protects it. We transfer personal information of European Economic Area ("EEA") and Swiss residents to the U.S. (or elsewhere) based upon the following legal frameworks:</p>
<ul style="padding: 30px;">
<li>Legitimate business interests: We could not provide our services or comply with our obligations to you without transferring your personal information to the U.S.</li>
<li>Consent: We may transfer your personal information when we receive your express, revocable consent.</li>
<li>Our use of Standard Contractual Clauses (also known as “Model Clauses”) where appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>GDPR</h2>
<p>We comply with the European Union’s General Data Protection Law ("GDPR"), which governs the protection of personal data of EU residents. To find out more about GDPR, please visit the European Union’s website, at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en.</p>
<p>EU users have the rights to: opt out of cookies; access, correct, delete, restrict or object to our use of their personal information; be forgotten; and data portability. We enable exercise of these rights through our products (which we reserve the right to modify). For example, we allow users to change their information, download their videos, and close their accounts. We also fulfil our obligations in response to direct requests.</p>
<p>If you require assistance, please contact our Data Protection Officer. We may require additional information from you to fulfil your requests. We may charge a reasonable fee if your request imposes an unreasonable cost on us.</p>
<p>We will afford UK-based users with all rights available to EU users, regardless of the UK’s EU member status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Controllers and Processors</h2>
<p>Some laws, including the GDPR, differentiate between controllers and processors of data. A "controller" has a direct relationship with you and exercises control over the use of your data. The third-party vendors that help a controller provide a service are considered "processors" because they process the controller’s customer data at the controller’s request (examples are payment processors and cloud-based hosting providers).</p>
<p>All XPMedia entities are controllers of personal information on users who upload and live stream videos.</p>
<p>With respect to the XPMedia platform, XPMedia Inc. are controllers of personal data of end users who view uploaders’ videos or live streams as these XPMedia entities have direct relationships with the end user viewers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any complaint. We encourage you to begin by contacting our Data Protection Officer. We endeavor to respond to requests promptly.</p>
<p>EU residents have the right to lodge complaints with the data protection authority of their country of residence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Data Protection Officer</h2>
<p>For any questions, inquiries, or complaints, please contact us at:</p>
<p>General Counsel and Data Protection Officer</p>
<p>XPMedia Inc.</p>
<p>PO Box 1017</p>
<p>Maricopa, AZ 85139</p>
