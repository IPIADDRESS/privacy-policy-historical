          <p>How Do We Use Personal Information? <br>
            Our primary goal is to   provide members with the most useful and enjoyable experience on the Internet.   Our advertisers will never be privy to your Membership Information, unless you   permit us to give it to them so that they can provide you with products or   services. Your e-mail address may be used by us for communications related to   the Xvideohost services, including but not limited to sending notices about   new features, products, or other information of interest to you. <br>
            The   Xvideohost website is constantly evolving and changing in content and in   features. Member Information helps guide such changes and the evolution of our   websites. Our advertisers and affiliates may be provided general information or   data regarding membership usage patterns or interests, so that they too can   better serve your needs and preferences, but such disclosure will not include   individually identifiable information. The collection of usage and interest   information allows us to provide a constantly evolving and user-sensitive   package of services, products, and features that satisfy member needs, wants and   desires but always with the priority of protecting individual member privacy. <br>
