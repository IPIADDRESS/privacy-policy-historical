										<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
										<br>
										<h2>The essence of our privacy policy</h2>
										<b>1) Information disclosure</b><br>
										We will not sell or otherwise distribute any of your personal information to any third party without 
										your specific and individual approval.<br>
										<b>2) Data visibility control</b><br>
										You are in control of the visibility of your personal contact information (email, phone numbers, IM etc.).<br>
										<b>3) Data ownership</b><br>
										You own your personal information and have the right to export and transfer it to any place you wish 
										including any other network.<br>
										<b>4) Meta data usage</b><br>
										We reserve the right to use so called "meta data" from activities on our system. Mata data never include 
										any personal information such as name, email address or IP address.<br>
										<b>5) Security</b><br>
										We use secure login encryption and we do encrypt all passwords stored on XeeMe. Our team will never 
										ask you for a password and is not able to decrypt or retrieve passwords for you.<br>
										<br>
										<br>
										<h2>The Privacy Policy</h2><br>
										<b>General Statement</b><br>
										While visiting our general web site XeeMe.com, we do not collect or require any personal information. 
										If you are using our services such as any of our online applications, we do 
										require users to register and ask you to provide personal and business profile information. The nature 
										of the XeeMe Social media application is to publicly share social presence information. 
										However it is up to you to define the level of exposure of your personal information 
										and who shall have access to that information. By default no personal information is exposed to anybody.<br>
										<br>
										<b>Support of the Respect Trust Framework</b><br>					
										This Privacy Policy incorporates by reference the Respect Trust Framework listed with the 
										<a href="http://openidentityexchange.org/trust-frameworks/respect-trust-framework" target="_blank">
										Open Identity Exchange</a><br>
										The purpose of the Respect Trust Framework is to define a simple set of principles and rules to which all 
										Members of a digital trust network agree so that they may share identity and personal data with greater 
										confidence that it will be protected and only used as authorized. XeeMe and all Members of the 
										Respect Network agree to operate under the Respect Trust Framework.<br>
										<br>
										<b>Collecting Personal Information</b><br>
										XeeMe may collect certain Personal Information from you when you use our services. You have the choice 
										to answer or decline almost any of the information except your first name, last name, your personal email 
										address and your business email address. Your name will be used to introduce you to others or be identified 
										in your network of business people you selected to collaborate with. Your personal email address is 
										exclusively used to access the XeeMe system and or request a lost password. Unless you explicitly provide 
										that email address to others it is not available for contacting you by anybody within XeeMe. Your business 
										email address is used to send you introductions or allow other users who you invited or confirmed their 
										invitation to contact you. None of your email addresses is available to any other user, than the one you 
										have a confirmed relationship or confirmed alliance with.<br>
										<br>
										<b>Data we store</b><br>
										We store registration data including your user name, email address and IP Addresses. We collect data from a variety of 
										activities and transactions, mainly to develop your social capital value report. We store all the information 
										you provide about yourself, as a representative of your company and data you provide for business activities. 
										We also store all connections you create, networks you develop and activities you perform with those networks.
										Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on XeeMe is considered a violation of XeeMe's 
										terms of services and should be brought to our attention.<br>
										<br>
										<b>Usage of Cookies</b><br>
										We are using so called "cookies", small information bits to store application relevant information in your 
										browser. Using the application requires that the use of cookies is enabled. You can review the content of 
										the cookie data at any time in your browser. We do not store email addresses or passwords.<br>
										<br>
										<b>Personal Information Disclosure</b><br>
										We will not sell or otherwise distribute any of your personal information to any third party without your 
										specific and individual approval. At this stage there is no plan or reason to ever even ask you for such 
										approval. XeeMe and all users of our services use XeeMe to build, maintain and grow their business 
										relationships and therefore we provide your personal information to those contacts you contact or agree to 
										be connected with. If you reject a connection request, your personal contact will not be exposed, forwarded 
										or otherwise available to such or any other user.<br>
										As you upload your personal contacts to XeeMe, you decide which of such contacts you want to invite into 
										your network on a contact by contact basis. The contacts you select to invite will be contacted by XeeMe to 
										join your network. You may choose not to invite selected contacts for whatever reason. Those not invited 
										contacts are considered "loose" contacts and neither invited nor contacted by XeeMe. But those 
										contacts may also exist in other connections within XeeMe and therefore be invited by others or contacted 
										by XeeMe through other sources.<br>
										An active user in XeeMe has the option to provide visibility to his or her personal contact information 
										only to their confirmed contacts and alliances (default) or only to their contacts but to alliances or to 
										everybody within XeeMe. Names, picture and general business relationship information including company name, 
										public company contact information and the users business profile is available to every XeeMe user.
										Every user has the option to add additional information to their contacts (Personal notes). That information 
										is only visible to that particular user, not to the contact or anybody else.<br>
										<br>
										<b>Sharing your information with third parties</b><br>
										We DO NOT share any of your personal information, in particular email address or age with third parties.<br>
										<br>
										<b>You sharing information with third parties</b><br>
										You are prohibited to share any of your information in XeeMe with any third party for whatever reason. 
										You are further prohibited to share your account access information with any other person that may access 
										your account for marketing or any other purpose, other than technically servicing your account.<br>
										<br>
										<b>Links inside XeeMe</b><br>
										XeeMe provides ways for users or user organizations to expose links to their websites or links to documents 
										and other sites. We request users to not use those links to point to any unlawful or any politically 
										incorrect or socially not appropriate sites or documents. While we undertake our best effort to maintain a 
										high level of ethics, we cannot guarantee that inappropriate links will exist.<br>
										<br>
										<b>Data Ownership</b><br>
										users own their personal data and have the right to alter, export or delete that information at any time. 
										As data get provided to confirmed connections, the user has the ability to decide whether such data can 
										be exported by their connections and used for other purposes like address books or others networks etc. 
										As personal connections may be shared by a person with their employer for the purpose of lead development, 
										such contacts will become part of the company's data.<br>
										Corporate users (companies) own their business data such as business opportunities, company profiles or 
										employee lists. As such data get shared with confirmed partners or alliances, the company agrees that such 
										shared data can be used by its alliance in any way or shape or based on contractual regulations outside XeeMe. 
										Any process of sharing cannot be reversed, other than by regulations outside XeeMe.<br>
										<br>
										<b>Social Graph Ownership</b><br>
										Our definition of "Social Graph": The social graphs are relationship maps describing the connection points 
										between entities (organizations or individuals) and their respective activities between such relationships.
										Activities between connections may be tracked and aggregated to develop reports such as the Social Capital 
										Value. XeeMe invented a series of rules, algorithms and processes to calculate values and provide 
										corresponding reports. Those rules, processes and algorithms as well as the resulting data are owned by 
										XeeMe. Each user has the right to use and communicate their own results in any way they wish. However users 
										are prohibited to export or otherwise distribute the underlying data that may contain references to other 
										user (companies or individuals).<br>
										<br>
										<b>Access Security</b><br>
										XeeMe is committed to protect our user's privacy. No XeeMe employee will ever ask you for your password. 
										Passwords are highly encrypted and we do not provide any way to decrypt such passwords. If a password gets 
										lost you will need to request a new password. We will not use your personal email address in any way, 
										other than sending you a lost password. We also do not provide your personal email address to any of your 
										connections, unless you decide to do so. All communication is performed using your business email address.<br>
										<br>
										<b>Privacy Policy Changes</b><br>
										XeeMe reserves the right to introduce changes to this privacy policy with 30 days notice. Any change of our 
										privacy policy will give users the right to immediately cancel their contract with full reimbursement of 
										pre paid subscription for the remainder of the subscription period and to remove all their information 
										from the system.<br>
