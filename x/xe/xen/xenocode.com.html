                    <p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></p>
                    <p>Cookies are pieces of information that a Web Site transfers to your hard   drive to store and sometimes track information about you.&nbsp; Most web browsers   automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to   prevent that.&nbsp; However, you may not be able to take full advantage of our Web Sites   if you do so.&nbsp; Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot   be accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your   movements around the web.&nbsp; Although they do identify a user's computer, cookies   do not personally identify customers or passwords.&nbsp; Credit card information is   not stored in cookies.</p>
