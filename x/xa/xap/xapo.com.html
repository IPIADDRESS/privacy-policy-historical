We do not link the information we store in cookies to any information you submit while on our website. We may also use the data collected via cookies to tailor advertisements to you and to track the popularity of our website. Our use of cookies and other technologies may allow us and third parties to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of our services.</li> <li><strong><em>Analytics</em></strong>.

Action tags may collect and transmit this data in a manner that identifies you if you have registered with our website, or are logged into our website. We also use action tags in our emails, to determine whether an email was opened or whether it was forwarded to someone else.

We use reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the personal information that we obtain from you from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please note that we are not responsible for the security of any data you are transmitting over the Internet, or any data you are storing, posting, or providing directly to a third party’s website, which is governed by that party’s policies. Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. If you have further questions about security, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:s%75ppor%74@x%61p%6f%2e%63om.">support@xapo.com.</a></p> <p><strong><em>Data Retention. </em></strong>If you wish to close your Xapo account altogether, please let us know by submitting a request to <a href="mailto:support@xapo.%63%6fm.">support@xapo.com.</a> We may retain information about you in our databases for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services and in accordance with applicable laws. Our retention and use of your information will be as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. The retention period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later.
