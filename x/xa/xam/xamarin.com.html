            <strong>1. </strong>
            <strong>HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our <a href="https://store.xamarin.com/terms">Terms of Use</a></span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>We collect the following types of information about you:</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong>
            <span>
                We ask for certain information such as your username, first and last name, nickname, affiliated organization, size of your affiliated organization, address, e-mail address and billing information when you register for a Xamarin account, make a purchase
                through the Service, or if you correspond with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in Content you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide
                to you the features and functionality of the Service.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Information we may receive from third parties</strong>
            <span>
                : We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through a third-party plug-in, that third party may pass certain information about
                your use of its service to Xamarin. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service. You may also unlink your third party account from
                the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span></span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Analytics information:</strong>
            <span>
                To assist us in improving the Service, we may directly, or through a third party (including use of third-party analytics tools), collect analytics data, measure traffic and usage trends for the Service, including the pages you visit, and collect
                other relevant information.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Cookies information</strong>
            <span>
                : When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Xamarin help you log in faster and enhance your
                navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your
                usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web
                browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not
                function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Log file information</strong>
            <span>
                : Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous
                information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and
                other such information.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Clear gifs/web beacons information</strong>
            <span>
                : When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track
                which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Device identifiers</strong>
            <span>
                : When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier
                (“UUID”). However, we will not collect UUIDs on user-created applications without your express consent. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely
                identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Xamarin. A device identifier
                may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not
                function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Location data</strong>
            <span>
                : When you access the Service, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your device. Location
                data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Commercial and marketing communications: </strong>
            <span>
                We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out
                or change your preferences. We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices).
                You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Use of certain service type information we collect about you: </strong>
            <span>
                We use or may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized
                content and information; (c) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently
                access your information after you sign in; (g) provide advertising to your browser or device; and (h) automatically update applications published by Xamarin. However, we will not automatically update user-created applications without your express
                consent.

            <strong>Who we may share your information with</strong>
            <span>
                : We may share your information with third-party business partners for the purpose of providing the Service to you. Those business partners will be given limited access to your information as is reasonably necessary to deliver the Service, and we
                will require that such third parties comply with this Privacy Policy.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Who you may choose to share your Content with</strong>
            <span>
                : Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as Content posted by you to our forums or bug tracking system, may become available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings. If you
                remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other users have copied or saved that information.
            </span>

        <p>
            <strong>What happens in the event of a change of control</strong>
            <span>
                : We may buy or sell/divest/transfer the company (including any shares in the company), or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses. Your information such as customer names and email addresses, Content and other user information
                related to the Service may be among the items sold or otherwise transferred in these types of transactions. We may also sell, assign or otherwise transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies,
                dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of the company.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Instances where we are required to share your information</strong>
            <span>: Xamarin will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our <a href="https://store.xamarin.com/terms">Terms of Use</a>        or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Xamarin, our users or others.</span>

            <strong>Sharing certain service type information we collect about you</strong>
            <span>
                : We may share certain service type information, including information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types,
                number of clicks, etc.): (i) with our third-party business partners for the purposes described in the section above on “
            </span>

            <strong>HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Storage and Processing</strong>
            <span>
                : Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Xamarin or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. Xamarin may transfer information that
                we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European
                Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection
                laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Xamarin or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information
                about you as described in this Privacy Policy.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Keeping your information safe</strong>
            <span>
                : Xamarin cares about the security of your information, and uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable
                steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your
                email communications from Xamarin, at all times. However, Xamarin cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Xamarin or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.
                Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of third party sites and services that you add to the Service. Xamarin is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Compromise of information</strong>
            <span>
                : In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Xamarin will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have
                been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.

            <span>
                Please refer to your mobile device or browser’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools. Depending on your type of device, it may not be possible to delete or disable
                tracking mechanisms on your mobile device. Note that disabling cookies and/or other tracking tools prevents Xamarin or its business partners from tracking your browser’s activities in relation to the Service. However, doing so may disable
                many of the features available through the Service. If you have any questions about opting out of the collection of cookies and other tracking/recording tools, you can contact us directly at <a href="mailto:support@xamarin.com">support@xamarin.com</a>.

        <p>
            <span>
                Xamarin does not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register as users. The Service and its content are not directed at children under the age of 13. In the event that we
                learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child
                under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@xamarin.com">support@xamarin.com</a>.
