If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site.

                    </ul>
                    We use the information described above to provide, maintain, support, improve, and personalize the Services.

        <h1>Xamarin Cloud Services Privacy Statement</h1>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="content">
    <div class="wrapper width-8">
        <p>Xamarin Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation, and its affiliates (“Xamarin”, “we”, “our”, “us”) are concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we process information that we collect in connection with our provision of our Test Cloud and Insights cloud services (the “Cloud Services”) to our customers (“Customers”).</p>
        <p>This Cloud Services Privacy Statement does not apply to any information that we may collect for our own purposes, such as through our website, our other software applications, social media pages and online portals.  Any such processing takes place in accordance with our <a href="#top">Privacy Statement</a>.</p>

        <h2>Information that our technology collects</h2>
        <p>The Cloud Services enable our Customers to collect and use information to improve the products and services that they provide to their own end users.  Specifically, through our Test Cloud, our Customers run their apps on our extensive collection of mobile devices, to help identify issues and ensure that their apps are functioning appropriately.  Our Insights service helps our Customers to understand how their end users interact with the Customers’ apps.</p>

        <h2>Information We May Process on Behalf of Our Customers</h2>
        <p>We may process certain information on behalf of, and solely at the direction of, our Customers, including, for example:
            </p><ul>
                <li>An ID we generate to identify the particular installed app</li>
                <li>Email address</li>
                <li>Test scripts that Customers provide us</li>
                <li>Apps that Customers upload to our Test Cloud service</li>
                <li>Google or other third-party account information, if an end user logs into a Customer’s app using his or her Google or other third-party credentials</li>
                <li>IP address, which may permit us to identify an end user’s general location</li>
                <li>Device identifier  </li>
                <li>Clickstream and usage information, including the date and time the Customer’s app is used and the parts of it that are used</li>
                <li>Device type </li>
                <li>Operating system type and version</li>
                <li>Crash date and log</li>
                <li>Connection type</li>
                <li>Cellular carrier</li>
                <li>Types of device accessories </li>
                <li>Other information, including personal information, that a Customer chooses to provide to us in connection with the Cloud Services</li>
            </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>We contractually prohibit our Customers from using the Cloud Services to collect, process or maintain any sensitive personal information, including, without limitation, Social Security and other government-issued identification numbers; payment card data; financial account information; passwords; information collected from children under the age of 13 or on apps directed to children; and health, genetic or biometric data.</p>

        <h2>How We May Use and Disclose the Information We Process</h2>
        <p>We use end user information on behalf of our Customers, who are the parties responsible for all information collected in the context of the Cloud Services, in order to provide the Cloud Services as agreed with Customers and as described in this Cloud Services Privacy Statement. We will only use such end user information to provide, maintain, support, and improve the Cloud Services.</p>
        <p>We may disclose the information we collect to the Customer to whom the information relates, as well as to our affiliates and to third-party service providers who provide various types of support for the Cloud Services, such as data analysis, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, auditing and other similar services.</p>
        <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also use or disclose collected information as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside an end user’s country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process and respond to requests from public and government authorities, including authorities outside an end user’s country of residence; (c) to enforce our terms and conditions; (d)&nbsp;to protect our operations, rights, privacy, safety or property and those of others; and (e) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.  We may also disclose collected information to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings) to or with such third party.</p>
        <p>We may aggregate and/or anonymize collected information so that it does not identify any particular Customer or end user, and use and disclose such aggregated or anonymized data for our own business purposes, such as developing, maintaining, supporting and improving the Cloud Services and our other products and services; promoting the Cloud Services; and creating and distributing reports.</p>

        <h2>Third-party services</h2>
        <p>This Cloud Services Privacy Statement does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy obligations, information or other practices of any third parties, including our Customers and any other third parties operating any app or service on which the Cloud Services are used.</p>

        <h2>Information location</h2>
        <p>Personal information collected may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States or in any other country where Xamarin or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. We take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this privacy statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.</p>
        <p>When we transfer personal information from the European Economic Area to other countries, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to help ensure your rights and protections travel with your data. Xamarin will abide by the requirements of European Economic Area and Swiss data protection law regarding the collection, use, transfer, retention, and other processing of personal data from the European Economic Area and Switzerland.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We use reasonable and appropriate organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect the information that we collect within our organization.  Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  If you have reason to believe that our security has been compromised, please immediately notify us in accordance with the “<a href="#cloud-contact-us">Contacting Us</a>” section below.</p>

        <h2>Retention Period</h2>
        <p>We retain the information we collect for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Cloud Services Privacy Statement, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by applicable law.</p>

        <h2>Updates to this statement</h2>
        <p>We may change this Cloud Services Privacy Statement.  The “<a href="#cloud-last-updated">Last Updated</a>” legend at the bottom of this page indicates when this Cloud Services Privacy Statement was last revised.  Any changes will become effective when we post the revised Cloud Services Privacy Statement on our website.</p>
