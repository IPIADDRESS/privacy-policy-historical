For information on how we use data and cookies on the Xaxis Web Site, please see Section 2 below.</p><p>Except as expressly stated otherwise, the use of information by our non-Xaxis affiliates, our clients and our service providers is not covered by this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;</p><p>Please note that because of the changing nature of privacy laws and regulations, user needs, and our business, we may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time.&nbsp; Accordingly, since we want to help you clearly understand our privacy practices, we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to become aware of any changes that may have occurred.&nbsp; You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the “Effective Date” above.</p><p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us through email or by mail.&nbsp; You can address your general questions and comments by e-mail to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@xaxis.com">privacy@xaxis.com</a>&nbsp;or by mail to us at c/o Xaxis, Inc., 132 West 31 Street, 9<sup>th</sup> Floor, New York, NY 10001, Attn: Legal Department.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Section 1: Xaxis Services Privacy Policy and Cookies</strong></p><p><strong>Xaxis’s Services</strong></p><p>We provide a range of services to our clients, including advertisers, agencies, publishers, and service providers. Xaxis’s services (“Services”) include: media planning, buying and selling; marketing communications planning; campaign analytics and research; paid search placement; search engine optimization; and audience segmentation and data management. Our clients use our Services in order to help ensure that online users receive the most useful and relevant ads. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, Xaxis’s Services do not include the services of Xaxis’s Light Reaction performance marketing division. For information on how Light Reaction collects and uses information through its services (as opposed to the collection and use of information through the Services or on the Xaxis Web Site), please click <a href="http://lightreaction.com/en/policy_emea_apac/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Types of Information We Collect through Our Services</strong></p><p>When you view and interact with Sites and with advertisements where our Services are utilized, we may collect through our Services information regarding your browsing, usage and interactions. We may also collect information that identifies browsers and devices we have interacted with previously. Such information collected through our Services may include the type of Internet browser, browser language, and operating system you use, your device’s Internet protocol (“IP”) address, unique identifiers available at or pertaining to your device, connection type (wired or Wi-Fi), region where your device is located, network to which your device is connected, longitude/latitude of a (mobile) device, mobile carrier (if available), the Site and page you came from before, and visited after, viewing an advertisement, and information related to the Site and page you are viewing (i.e., in order to ascertain your interests). Devices include computers, mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, or other digital devices capable of maintaining an Internet connection.</p><p>We do not collect users’ names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or similar personally identifiable information through our Services. &nbsp;</p><p>We collect information through the use of cookies, pixels and other technologies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored in a browser by a Site or ad server which allows that Site or ad server to recognize that browser and remember user preferences and other information. A pixel is a line of code that is used by a Site or third party to assign online activities to a device or browser. The use of a pixel allows Sites and us to record, for example, that a device or browser has visited a particular Site or page. Additional information from an earlier period or interaction, which may include interest, demographic or other information intended to provide users with more useful and relevant online advertising, may also be associated with such device or browser.</p><p><strong>How We Use Information Collected through Our Services</strong></p><p>We use the information collected through our Services to help ensure that you receive the most useful and relevant online advertising you see on Sites (including on web sites in a browser environment and/or in applications, and on other devices and browsers that we have reasonably linked to the device and/or browser where the information was collected) (we refer to customized advertising based on users’ interests as “Interest-Based Advertising”). For example, if we think that a user is interested in apparel options, then our Services may help our clients deliver Interest-Based Advertisements to that user about a particular type of apparel, as follows:</p><p><img alt="" src="https://www.xaxis.com/images/content/site/image1.jpg" style="width:100%">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="" src="https://www.xaxis.com/images/content/site/image2.jpg" style="width:100%"></p><p><img alt="" src="https://www.xaxis.com/images/content/site/image3.jpg" style="width:100%"></p><p>Such information may also be used to limit the number of times you see a particular ad, and for other purposes such as research, reporting and analysis in order to deliver the most useful and relevant advertising and to determine and improve the effectiveness of that advertising.</p><p>We may also receive from other companies information collected outside the Services for use in connection with the Services, also to help ensure that online users receive the most useful and relevant advertising and to determine and improve the effectiveness of that advertising. We do not associate such information with your name, mailing address, email address or similar personally identifiable information.</p><p>We require our clients to comply with applicable laws governing online privacy.&nbsp; We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the Sites you visit to better understand issues relating to your online privacy.</p><p><strong>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</strong></p><p>We may disclose the information we collect about you (see “Types of Information We Collect through Our Services” above), and information derived from it, to our clients and service providers.&nbsp; As we do not collect users’ names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or similar personally identifiable information through our Services, we do not disclose any such information to third parties.&nbsp; However, if you decide to provide personally identifiable information via one of our clients’ advertisements or Sites, then that information will be received by that client and will be subject to that client’s privacy policy.&nbsp; Our service providers are not permitted to use non-aggregated information we disclose to them for any purpose other than providing services to us or our clients.</p><p>Xaxis, Inc. operates and maintains a proprietary data management platform that affiliates controlled by Xaxis, Inc., including Light Reaction, utilize in order to provide services.</p><p>We also may disclose the information we collect to third parties, including law enforcement, when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.</p><p><strong>Disclosure of Information to Market Research Companies</strong></p><p>We may disclose the information we collect about you to market research companies, which companies can add demographic, interest, and similar information to the information collected by us. We may aggregate this information together with the information we collect about you, for purposes of research, reporting, analysis and optimization of online advertising campaigns.</p><p><strong>User Choice</strong></p><p>We collect information through our Services via the use of cookies, pixels and other technologies.&nbsp; We believe that the use of these technologies enables us and our clients to provide users with a more useful digital experience.</p><p>You may simply choose not to receive customized third-party advertisements via Xaxis cookies on the browser you are using by clicking below, in which case your unique third-party Xaxis cookie will be replaced with a non-unique “opt-out” cookie and the Interest-Based Advertising data previously collected or received in association with the replaced unique third-party Xaxis cookie will not be used for Interest-Based Advertising on any other device or browser that we have reasonably linked to the browser where the information was collected:</p><p><a href="http://xaxis.com/static/view/opt-out-confirmation" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://www.xaxis.com/images/content/site/btn-opt-out.gif" style="height:25px; width:74px"></a></p><p>Our opt-out cookies are programmed to expire ten years after they are initially issued.&nbsp; If you buy a new device, upgrade or change web browsers or delete this opt-out cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out process again.&nbsp; In order for the opt-out to work, your browser must be set to accept third-party cookies.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>You may also opt out from Xaxis cookies, and in some cases refuse or remove cookies from both Xaxis and other service providers, via the following methods:</p><ul><li>You may adjust your browser settings to refuse or remove cookies, which would result in the elimination of Interest-Based Advertising via cookies from other providers in addition to Xaxis.&nbsp; However, by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on the Sites you visit or take full advantage of all Site offerings and Interest-Based Advertising.&nbsp; You may refuse or remove cookies by following the directions provided in your browser settings.&nbsp;

In accordance with the Codes of Conduct, we require our Xaxis Marketplace (formerly Xaxis Publisher Network and 24/7 Access) clients to inform users about their privacy and information collection practices via their privacy policies and to include in their privacy policies information regarding the use of third-party advertising technology and services on their Sites, the types of data collected through these services, the use and distribution of that data, and a link to an industry standard opt-out from Interest-Based Advertising.&nbsp; We periodically monitor the Sites of our clients to determine whether they are adequately disclosing and updating their privacy statements.</p><p>We fully support the digital advertising industry’s efforts to increase transparency in the area of Interest-Based Advertising and health segments.&nbsp;

Advertisements that are provided by organizations that participate in these frameworks will display the icon displayed below when technologically feasible. &nbsp;If you click on the icon displayed on an ad, you will receive information about Interest-Based Advertising.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="https://www.xaxis.com/images/content/site/image6.jpg" style="height:126px;
