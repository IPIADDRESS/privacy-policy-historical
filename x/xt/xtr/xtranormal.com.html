<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Third-Party advisers, Links to other Sites:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Xtranormal allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Site. These third party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly through your browser, the advertisements that appear within the Site and they automatically receive your IP address when this happens. Such third party ad servers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Xtranormal does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Xtranormal to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third party ad servers or ad networks. Xtranormal privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of such other advertisers or web sites.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Xtranormal's commitment to data security:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Xtranormal uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of User information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of User information you transmit to Xtranormal and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, Xtranormal makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>If Xtranormal learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Xtranormal may post a notice on the Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should e-mail customer support.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Xtranormal's commitment to children's privacy:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Xtranormal does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information on the Site from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of the Site is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Site at any time or in any manner. If Xtranormal learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13 years of age has been collected on the Site without verifiable parental consent, then Xtranormal will take the appropriate steps to delete the information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained an Xtranormal User Account, then you may e-mail customer support and request that Xtranormal delete that child's personal information from its systems.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>If you have any questions or comments about Xtranormal privacy policy, would like to advise us how you would like your personal information not to be used or disclosed, or would like to access or update your personal information, please e-mail customer support. You can also write at Xtranormal Inc. 222 Sutter Street, Suite 450, San Francisco, CA 94108, attention: support.

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the event of Merger, sale or bankruptcy:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>If Xtranormal is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from the Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred or used.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Acceptance of Privacy Policy:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>This Privacy Policy outlines the information usage practices of Xtranormal. By accessing, browsing or using the Site or by submitting your personal information to Xtranormal, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not submit your personal information to us.

<p class="c0"><span>Last updated on Sept 30, 2011.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our Commitment to Privacy</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Accountability</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>We collect, use and disclose the data of the student under the age of thirteen (13):</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>to open the membership account;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>to authenticate the identity;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>to facilitate communication and sharing with the teacher;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Please note the personal data of a student under thirteen (13) is used for the purpose above, as such Xtranormal will not sell or give your data to third party vendors.

<p class="c0"><span>You may instruct us to refrain from using or sharing your personal information in any or all of the three ways described above at any time by providing written notification to our Privacy Officer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

Some specific safeguards may include:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Physical measures such as locked filing cabinets. Organizational measures such as restricting employee access to files and databases as appropriate; Electronic measures such as passwords and firewalls; and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Investigative measures where we have reasonable grounds to believe that personal information is being inappropriately collected used or disclosed. However, absolute privacy cannot be guaranteed for any online animation, private message or other content posted on or shared through Xtranormal, so we strongly recommend that you do not include sensitive personal information in any online content.</span></p>
