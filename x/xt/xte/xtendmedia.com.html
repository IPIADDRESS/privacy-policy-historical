                    <strong>This Privacy Policy does not apply to  any other web sites, products or services that are provided by or through XTEND  MEDIA or its affiliates, including any such web sites, products or services  that you may be linked to from this Web Site. You are strongly encouraged to  read the privacy policies of each and every web site you visit.</strong><br><br><br>
                    <strong>TYPES  OF PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION:</strong><br>

If you choose to send us certain Personal Information about yourself by  submitting your resume, you authorize XTEND MEDIA to store your information and  resume in the XTEND MEDIA recruitment database, currently located in the USA, for the  purpose of assessing your suitability for current and future vacancies.

We do  not use cookies to retrieve Personal Information from your computer. <br>
<br>
We also use invisible tracking or counting devices known as "web  bugs" to register that a particular web page has been viewed. A "web  bug" is an electronic image, also known as a clear GIF or a single-pixel  (1x1) that can recognize certain types of information on an individual's  computer, such as an individual's cookie number, the time and date of a page  view, and a description of the page where the web bug is placed. <br>
