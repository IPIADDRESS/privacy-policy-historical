	  <h2>Third Party Advertisin<wbr>g</h2>
	  <h3>Advertisem<wbr>ents appearing on the Famento Sites, Product or Services may be delivered to users by Famento or one of our Web advertisin<wbr>g partners. Our Web advertisin<wbr>g partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisem<wbr>ent. In this way, ad servers may compile informatio<wbr>n about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisem<wbr>ents and determine which ads are clicked on. This informatio<wbr>n allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisem<wbr>ents that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Famento and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertiser<wbr>s.</h3>

	  <h3>Famento does not share any personally<wbr> identifiab<wbr>le informatio<wbr>n with advertiser<wbr>s. Famento may share general demographi<wbr>c informatio<wbr>n (such as aggregated<wbr> statistics<wbr> about members' interests and occupation<wbr>s) and non-person<wbr>ally identifiab<wbr>le informatio<wbr>n (such as browser type and IP addresses)<wbr> with advertiser<wbr>s and partners. Famento does not give advertiser<wbr>s access to your individual<wbr> personal account informatio<wbr>n. However, by selecting,<wbr> interactin<wbr>g with or viewing an ad you are consenting<wbr> to the possibilit<wbr>y that the advertiser<wbr> will make the assumption<wbr> that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.</h3>

      <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <h3>Famento may revise, modify or update this policy. We may notify you about significan<wbr>t changes in the way we treat personal informatio<wbr>n by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your particular<wbr> Famento account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.  You are encouraged<wbr> to check this policy frequently<wbr> for any changes as your continued use of the xtimeline service indicates your consent to such changes.</h3>
	  <h2>Confidenti<wbr>ality and Security</h2>

	  <h3>No data transmissi<wbr>ons over the Internet can be guaranteed<wbr> to be 100% secure. Consequent<wbr>ly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any informatio<wbr>n you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your informatio<wbr>n, we take reasonable<wbr> measures to secure it on our systems.</h3>
	  <h3>If Famento learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronic<wbr>ally so that you can take appropriat<wbr>e protective<wbr> steps. By using xtimeline or providing personal informatio<wbr>n to us you agree that we can communicat<wbr>e with you electronic<wbr>ally regarding security, privacy and administra<wbr>tive issues relating to your use of those sites, products and services. We may post a notice on our applicable<wbr> web sites if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the applicable<wbr> web sites. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstan<wbr>ces. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic<wbr> notice) you should notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@xtimeline.com">privacy@xt<wbr>imeline.co<wbr>m</a>.</h3>

	  <h3>
	    <ul>
		  <li>You can edit your account informatio<wbr>n with xtimeline at any time. Most personal informatio<wbr>n you may provide is entirely optional. For example, to the extent that parents are considerin<wbr>g whether to permit their children to use xtimeline,<wbr> we do not condition a child's participat<wbr>ion based upon their provision of any more personal informatio<wbr>n than is necessary to operate those sites, products and services.</li>

		  <li>You can delete your applicable<wbr> account by visiting the applicable<wbr> account deletion page; however, please note that some personal informatio<wbr>n, primarily your contact informatio<wbr>n, may remain in our records to the extent necessary to protect our legal interests or document compliance<wbr> with regulatory<wbr> requiremen<wbr>ts.</li>
