			</p>

			<p>
				On pages where you can send content to a third-party such as a “Tell-A-Friend” type feature; although we ask for a recipient's email address, we don't store this information, but rather 
				delete it from our system after the message is sent.  We collect this third-party information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.   Prize winners may be required to provide 
				additional information for prize fulfillment.

			<strong><a name="specialnotes">SPECIAL NOTES ABOUT CERTAIN INFORMATION</a></strong>
            <ul>
				<li>
					<u>Member Names / Gaming Console IDs / Gaming Network Services:</u>  Certain Online Services offered by the Company, including multiplayer gaming and specialized websites, use third party services 
					to provide authentication for Online Services or associate a Company website account with a Gaming Console ID or Gaming Network Service account. When you use a third-party authentication 
					service you will be asked to provide account information associated with that third party service. When you register to join an Online Service from a third-party gaming network system, 
					certain membership information will be transferred automatically to the Company.
					
				</li><br>
				<li>

					<u>Public Information Including Message Boards, User Generated Content, Forums, News Blogs, Comments, User Profiles and Chat Rooms:</u>  Whenever you give out personal information in public areas 
					such as on a message board, chat room, comment field or profile page, that information can be collected and used by other people. Information that you disclose in any of these forums is public 
					information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality there. You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit in the course of these public 
					activities can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages or identify you.  If you post a video, image, photo or other content 
					on one of our sites for public view you should be aware that these may be viewed, collected, copied and/or used by other users without your consent. We are not responsible for any public 
					information or content you post on our sites.
				</li><br>
				<li>
					<u>E-mail Correspondence:</u>  We may provide e-mail addresses or forms to which visitors can send us questions or comments, or which visitors can use to request customer support. In the process of 
					receiving and responding to such requests, we may collect personal information about you, such as your e-mail address or any other personal data contained in the body of your e-mail message. 
					By allowing you to send us these requests, we are not attempting to solicit personal information from you. We only use the information for the purpose of responding to your questions and/or 
					comments or to provide customer support. In most cases, your message is deleted immediately after we've resolved your inquiry; however, in some instances, copies of your requests may be kept 
					on file for our records or for quality control purposes. If we have actual knowledge that the person with whom we're communicating is a child under the age of thirteen, we delete the child's 
					e-mail address and message immediately after responding.
					<br>
					<br>
					In addition to responding to your email correspondence and sending you information you have requested via our email lists, we send activation emails and other transactional emails to your e-mail 
					address as necessary.  You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.
				</li><br>

				<li>
					<u>Resumes:</u>  The Company allows for the online submission of resumes. Personal information collected from resumes will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate 
					submissions for job postings, and is therefore not governed by this Privacy Policy. Information obtained from resumes may be shared within the Company by parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates.
				</li><br>
				<li>
					<u>Investor Relations:</u>  The Company provides investor relations materials on its websites. Personal information collected on the investor relations' portion of the Take Two Interactive Software,

			<strong><a name="consequences">WHAT HAPPENS IF I REFUSE TO PROVIDE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?</a></strong>

            <p>
				Your refusal to submit personal information may limit your ability to participate in some activities, such as sweepstakes, online purchases, or use of certain Online Services. However,

			<strong><a name="cookiesip">DO YOUR WEBSITES USE COOKIES, TRACK IP ADDRESSES OR USE OTHER PASSIVE MEANS TO COLLECT INFORMATION?</a></strong>
            <p>
				The Company uses cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking devices on its websites to collect information that is not personally identifiable.  If you choose to provide us with information, 
				it may be linked to the data stored by these technologies. 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<u>Cookies:</u> A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that websites often store on a user's computer. Our cookies do not include people's names, e-mail addresses, or other information 
					that is personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user's computer and to "remember" things about the user's visit (such as the user’s use of various features on the 
					service). You can always disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer; however, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use certain portions 
					of the websites.  
				</li><br>

				<li>
					<u>Flash Cookies:</u> We also use flash cookies, also known as "shared objects," on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember 
					the site's settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Flash cookies only collect data in the aggregate. Like normal cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer 
					and are not tied to your personally identifiable information. One method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel 
					at <a href="http://www.macromedia.com">www.macromedia.com</a>.
				</li><br>
				<li>
					<u>Web Beacons:</u> A “web beacon” is an electronic image that allows websites to count users who have visited certain pages or viewed certain advertisements.  Web beacons, like cookies, do not include 
					personally identifiable information.  
				</li><br>

				<li>
					<u>Internet Log Files:</u> The Company may also keep track of your Internet Protocol (IP) and computer MAC addresses for various reasons. An IP address is a number that is used by a networked device and 
					will identify your point of connection to the internet. Depending on your network configuration, it may also identify your computer. A computer MAC address identifies one specific piece of hardware. 
					These log files are not tied to your personally identifiable information.  
				</li><br>
				<li>
					<u>Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies:</u>  Other information that may be passively collected by the Company includes log files that record information about your hardware, product use or website 
					navigational activity. We also use these log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. 
				</li><br>
				<li>
					<u>Third-party Advertisers:</u> The Company works with various third-party advertising agents that use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect non-personal information.  Please click on the 
					links below to learn more about these vendors, their privacy policies, and the ability to opt out of their tracking programs.  Please note that the inclusion of a vendor in the list below does not mean 
					that the Company is currently using them as advertising agents or that it is currently conducting any campaigns that use such technologies.  We do not have access or control of the third party tracking 
					technologies.

			<strong><a name="collectpersonalinfo">WHO IS COLLECTING MY INFORMATION AND HOW WILL IT BE USED? </a></strong>
            <p>
				When you submit information to the Company via our Online Services, or information is automatically collected as described in this Privacy Policy, that information is received by the Company. 
				The Company uses the submitted information to send you promotional materials, to provide you with access to our services, to fulfill product orders, fulfill “tell a friend” requests, and to 
				respond to questions or technical problems. We also use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we 
				provide you and to better meet your needs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Your participation in tournaments or other online game events is conditional upon our collection, use, storage, transmission and public display of statistical data (such as your scores, rankings 
				and achievements) generated through your participation.
			</p>
			<p>

				Users of certain Online Services, such as the Rockstar Games Social Club, may be automatically entered into contests as a result of their membership and/or use of certain services. Check 
				<a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/socialclub/events">www.rockstargames.com/socialclub/events</a> frequently for details regarding contests. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Online gaming by its very nature is an open community where gameplay information including user name, game activity, and leaderboard rankings are publicly posted for other people to see. Therefore, 
				the Company will post certain information automatically on the specialized game websites, such as your Screen Name or ID and gameplay statistics. However, we will not post information that we know directly 
				and clearly identifies you (such as your real name or email address) unless you provide that information voluntarily for such use. As with other gameplay information services, gameplay and leaderboards 
				generated by our specialized game websites may appear nested in our games or third-party webpages via frames or widgets. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We may match and/or combine information collected by various Online Services and display it publicly, including on our websites or in game lobbies.  For example, if you associate your Company website account 
				with a game console account, your in-game achievements may be displayed combining your website account name with your in-game achievements. 
			</p>
			<p>

				From time to time, the Company may employ vendors to perform services on the Company's behalf. These vendors provide internal support to the Company by operating some of the services we provide you such as 
				shipping, credit card processing, and email services. Although these vendors, not the Company, may collect, use or maintain the information in connection with the Online Services, the Company still requires 
				that they adhere to the Company's stated privacy policies and that they not share your personal information with third-parties or use the information for their own marketing purposes.

			<strong><a name="shared">WITH WHOM DOES THE COMPANY SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?</a></strong>

				The Company may also share your personal information with third-parties as described in this Privacy Policy.  The Company may share your personal information to fulfill a request you have made, 
				such as a product purchase from the Company store or a providing you with a special ringtone. In the event we offer services or promotions where your personal information is separately collected 
				and used according to the privacy policy of a third-party, we will inform you of that at the time of collection and you may elect not to participate in the service or promotion. In addition, we may 
				share aggregate information (not personal information) regarding site usage statistics and user demographics with third-parties, but this information will not include personally identifiable information. 
			</p>

			<p>
				We may share your personal information with third-parties, including as required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual 
				property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability. We also may share your personal information with third-parties when we have reason to 
				believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or 
				damage, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on the Company. 
				In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event involving all or a portion of the Company, the Company's customer information may be
