				<p> X.com and the providers of goods or services through 
      the X.com Website (“Providers”) recognize the importance of protecting 
      your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains the practices regarding 
      information provided or obtained in connection with only the X.com 
      Website (<a href="http://www.x.com">www.x.com</a>), including information that is personally
				  identifiable to you (“Personal Information”).</p><p>
				  
				</p><p> You may provide Personal Information in several ways. For example,
				  you may provide Personal Information when you fill out the initial
				  application on the X.com website, when you obtain products or services
				  from a Provider or when you contact a customer service department. In
				  order to open accounts with Providers, it is necessary to collect and
				  retain Personal Information, which may include your name, postal address,
				  e-mail address, telephone number, social security number, and age and
				  date of birth.</p>
                <p> In connection with goods or services requested or obtained through the
                  X.com Website and/or the operation of the X.com Website, Personal
                  Information about you may be shared and used. The purposes with which
                  Personal Information might be shared or used include the following:</p>
                  <ul type="square">
                    <li><font face="face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Identifying you; </font>
                    </li><li><font face="face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Protecting against 
                      error and fraud; </font>

                      products and services to meet your needs; </font>
                    </li><li><font face="face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Providing ongoing 
                      service, including processing your transactions; </font>
                    </li><li><font face="face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In order to verify the
                      existence and condition of your account for a third party; </font>
                    </li><li><font face="face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Complying with legal 
                      requirements; </font>

				<p>For example, in order to seamlessly
				  integrate all aspects of the products and services on a secure,
				  easy-to-use Internet platform, Personal Information about you may be shared
				  with the Providers. Thus, Personal Information about you may be shared with
				  First Western National Bank, La Jara, Colorado, which provides banking products
				  and services through the X.com Website. Likewise, Personal Information about
				  you may be shared with credit bureaus or third parties that provide services
				  on behalf of X.com or Providers, such as data processors.</p>
				  
				<p>X.com and the Providers seek to limit the information requested to
				  information required to provide you with the products and services offered
				  through this Website. In addition, Personal Information will be safeguarded
				  according to strict standards of security summarized in this Privacy Policy.
				  Furthermore, X.com and the Providers only allow authorized employees, who are
				  trained in the proper handling of confidential information to have access to
				  Personal Information about you.</p>
				  
				<p> A condition of sharing of Personal Information is that the receiving party
				  retain the information pursuant to its own privacy policies, which may be no
				  less stringent than this Privacy Policy. X.com reserves the right to audit
				  Providers to determine if they are complying with their privacy policies.</p>
				  
				<p> X.com also collects general information about visits to our site. For
				  example, we compile statistics to determine the number of daily visitors, the
				  pages or sections most frequently visited and how long people remain at each
				  page. This information is used to help meet customer needs. The information
				  is recorded, but is not identified to a specific visitor.</p>
				  
				<p> Operation of the X.com Website involves the use of small data files that are
				  saved on a user’s computer, commonly known as “cookies.” However, cookies do
				  not contain any information that will enable anyone to contact you via telephone,
				  e-mail, or any other means.</p>
				  
				<p> You can review and update your profile in X.com’s records through X.com's
				  on-line account maintenance function. We encourage you to correct any
				  inaccurate or outdated information that you may discover.</p>
				  
				<p> X.com also seeks to keep Personal Information secure. Interaction with
				  X.com requires an Internet browser that supports: (i) encryption that encodes
				  information so that it can’t be read without decoding; and (ii) Secure Sockets
				  Layer (“SSL”) version 3.0 protocol, which ensures that unauthorized users
				  cannot interrupt or intercept any communications. Netscape Navigator 4.06 or
				  higher or Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher, which utilize automatic
				  SSL activation, should be used. All information exchanged between the X.com
				  website and you will be encrypted using SSL. No financial data will be
				  transmitted over non-SSL connections.</p>
				  
				<p> Access to Personal Information about you requires an authenticated login,
				  using a user name/password combination. It is essential that you never
				  reveal your password to anyone and that you change it on a periodic basis.
				  You also should log out if you are going to step away from your computer.</p>
				  
				<p> You also should be aware that all databases storing Personal Information
				  about you are situated topologically behind three layers of firewall
				  protection. Tape backup occurs nightly in a secured network environment on
				  our network backbone. These tapes are secured in a vault and retrieved only
				  by authorized personnel. X.com's security measures are actively tested and
				  certified by reputable independent security audit groups on a regular basis.</p>
				  
				<p> If you have questions regarding the capacities of your Internet browser,
				  or these security measures, please contact X.com at 888-447-8999 or customerservice@x.com.</p>
				  
				<p> X.com and Providers may, from time to time, share information about you and
				  your experiences on the X.com Website with companies that are related by common
				  ownership or affiliated by corporate control to X.com or to the Providers, as
				  applicable (“Affiliates”). You may request that X.com or a Provider not share
				  information (other than experience information) with Affiliates by contacting
				  X.com in the manner described below with regard to inquiries about its Privacy
				  Policy.</p>
      <p>X.com reserves that right to change this Privacy Policy and to apply 
      such changes to Personal Information collected after the change, but will 
      not do so without posting the revised Privacy Policy on our Website. 
      Information submitted before the change will never be used in a new way 
      without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prevent 
      that new use. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy from time to 
      time to make sure you understand how Personal Information about you may be 
      used.</p>
				  
				<p> Information sharing among X.com and the Providers is integral to the quality
				  and cost of services and products provided through the X.com Website. <b>You
				  should seek a relationship with X.com and the Providers only if you agree with
				  this Privacy Policy.</b> This Privacy Policy will continue to apply even if you
				  cease to use the products and services of the X.com Website.</p>
                  <p>We also participate in the Council of Better Business 
                  Bureaus' BBB<i>OnLine</i><sup><small>®</small></sup> Privacy Program, and comply with all the
