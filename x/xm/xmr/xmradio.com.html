XM Satellite Radio Inc. supports a policy of openness about the collection and use of personal information about our customers.
<p>
We have adopted and implemented this privacy policy as part of our commitment to protecting your personal information from misuse.
</p><p>
<b>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</b>
<br><br>
We collect personally identifiable information and demographic information about you only if you choose to register online for one of our services, games, contests or promotions.
</p><p>
When you register online for one of our services, you complete a registration form that requires you to provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address and telephone number.  If you register online for one of our paid services, such as a subscription to the XM Satellite Radio service, the registration form also requires you to provide personally identifiable information, including your credit card information.  Our online registration forms may also request your date of birth, which you are not required to provide.
</p><p>
The form may also request demographic information, which you are not required to provide, including:  your gender, marital status, education and occupation; your household size and income; the number of drivers in your household; the make, model and age of your car; the make, model and features of your car audio system; whether you own or lease your car; information about your commute and the amount of time you spend driving; and your favorite musicians and types of music.  We may supplement the information you provide us by acquiring additional information from third parties.
</p><p>
When you register online for one of our games, contests or promotions, you complete an online registration form that requires you to provide your name and email address so that we can administer the game, contest or promotion and notify the winners.
</p><p>
We also collect anonymous information, which does not personally identify you, when you visit our website.  The anonymous information includes the pages you view on our website, the search terms you enter into our search utility, your IP address and the operating system, browser software and internet service provider you use.
</p><p>
We may use the standard "cookie" feature of major browser applications and other data capture mechanisms that allow us to store data about your visit.  Cookies help us learn which areas of our site are useful and which areas need improvement.  We will not use cookies or other data capture mechanisms to collect any personally identifiable information about you.  You may configure your browser to prevent cookies from being set on your computer.  If you do so, you may still view most of the website, although you may not be able to enjoy all of our services.
</p><p>
<b>HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</b>
<br><br>
We use the personally identifiable information you provide us to register your subscription, deliver the service you have requested and contact you if we need more information.  We use your credit card information only to charge you for any paid services you have authorized.  We will not supply your credit card information to any third party except the credit card company or associated billing company.  We will share demographic information, on an aggregate basis, with advertisers, business partners and other companies.
</p><p>
Unless you choose to opt out, we may also use personally identifiable information and demographic information to identify products or services that might be of interest to you and to provide you with information by email, postal mail or telephone about products or services offered by our company, our business partners or other companies.  Unless you choose to opt out, we may supply personally identifiable information and demographic information to our business partners and other companies, which may use it to provide you with information about their products or services by email, postal mail or telephone.  You may opt out by unchecking a box on the online registration form.
</p><p>
We may disclose personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary (a) to conform to the law or to comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates; (b) to protect and defend our rights or property or the rights or property of other users of our website; or (c) to act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our website or the public.  In the event that we sell our company or all or substantially all of its assets, we may transfer personally identifiable information to the purchaser, which will be bound by the terms of this privacy policy.
</p><p>
We use the anonymous information we collect from our website to administer our site, improve our services, determine how our website is being used, identify popular areas of our website and analyze trends and usage patterns.  We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server.  This anonymous information cannot be used to identify you personally.
</p><p>
Our website may offer interactive services, such as chat rooms, forums and message boards.  Please remember that any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personally identifiable information in these areas.
</p><p>
Our website may contain links to other websites.  We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those websites, including the use of personally identifiable information about you collected by those websites.
</p><p>
<b>DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT CHILDREN?</b>
<br><br>
You must be at least eighteen years old to register online for our services, games, contests and promotions.  If you are a minor (under the age of eighteen), please do not submit any personally identifiable information to us.

<b>HOW SECURE IS THE WEBSITE?</b>
<br><br>
Our website is highly secure, with extra security in place to protect personally identifiable information. We use a varied combination of security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information you provide us when you register online.
</p><p>
<b>HOW DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THE PRIVACY POLICY HAS CHANGED?</b>
<br><br>
We may change this privacy policy at any time without notice.  We will post any changes on our website's privacy policy page so that you will always know what type of information we collect and how we use the information.
</p><p>
