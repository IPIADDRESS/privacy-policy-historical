We collect and use your personal data in accordance with the relevant provisions of German data protection legislation. In this Privacy Policy, we would like to tell you which personal data we collect and what we use it for.</p>
<p>Below, 6Wunderkinder tells you about the type and extent of and the purposes for which personal data are collected and used. You can call up this information on our website anytime.</p>
<h4 id="controller">Controller</h4>
<p>The controller within the meaning of German data protection laws is:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 Wunderkinder GmbH</li>
<li>Brunnenstr. 141</li>
<li>D-10115 Berlin (Mitte)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about data protection, you are welcome to also contact us by email at this address: <a href="mailto:support@wunderlist.com" page="[object Object]" title="support@wunderlist.com">support@wunderlist.com</a></p>
<h4 id="subject-of-data-protection">Subject of Data Protection</h4>
<p>The subject of data protection is personal data. According to Section 3, Subsection 1 of the German Federal Data Protection Act ("Bundesdatenschutzgesetz"), these are individual details on personal or objective circumstances of a certain person or certain persons. These include details such as your name, your postal address, your email address, your telephone number or, where appropriate, even use-data.</p>
<h4 id="collection-and-use-of-data">Collection and Use of Data</h4>
<h5 id="automated-data-collection">Automated Data Collection</h5>
<p>When you access 6Wunderkinder websites, your internet browser automatically transmits data for technical reasons. The following data are stored separately from other data that you may have sent us:</p>
<ul>
<li>your date and time of access,</li>
<li>your browser-type and version,</li>
<li>the operating system you use,</li>
<li>the URL of the website you have previously visited,</li>
<li>the quantity of data transmitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>For technical reasons these data are stored and are not assigned to any identifiable person at any time.</p>
<h5 id="data-entered-by-users">Data Entered by Users</h5>
<p>You can use the Wunderlist product both with and without registering. However, you can only access Wunderlist using certain terminals such as an iPhone, iPod, iPad, Windows, Mac or Android and without additional functions. In order to make use of all its advantages, you have to register. To do this, you must enter your email address and select a password. We require these data in order to guarantee that you are able to make full use of our entire offer. We need these and possibly other data not least in order to respond to your wishes, questions and criticism.</p>
<p>In future, we plan to introduce an option which will allow you to design your account personally. For example, you will be able to add a photo, choose a username and set up a connection to your Facebook user account. You will not be obliged to design your account personally; this will be entirely voluntary.</p>
<p>The central function of Wunderlist product is task management. You will be able to use this product both online and offline.</p>
<p>Where Wunderlist is used solely offline, the data you enter will be stored de-centrally on your storage medium. In such a case, we will not be able to access these data.</p>
<p>If you use Wunderlist in combination with a registered account, all data and tasks entered will be integrated into a database. The purpose of this database is to allow you to use Wunderlist at various different levels and call up your tasks anywhere and at any time. Data are transmitted to the respective terminal using SSL encryption so that your data are transmitted securely.</p>
<p>We use personal data in order to enable secure, effective and user-related use of Wunderlist services, including for:</p>
<ul>
<li>calling up the task-list via the internet;</li>
<li>anonymously analysing task management statistics for press releases by 6Wunderkinder and studies;</li>
<li>recommending Wunderlist by using the "Invite" function for friends and acquaintances (email address).</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="transfer-of-data">Transfer of Data</h5>
<p>We will not transfer your data to third parties as a matter of course without letting you know in advance or asking for your prior permission. We may only transfer your data to third parties without informing you separately beforehand in the following exceptional cases as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>If required for investigating the illegal use of Wunderlist or for legal proceedings, personal data will be transferred to the criminal investigation authorities and, if appropriate, to injured third parties. We will only do this if there are concrete indications of illegal and/or abusive behaviour. We can only transfer on your personal data if this is used to enforce General Terms and Conditions of Business or other agreements. We are also legally obliged to give certain public authorities information. These are criminal investigation authorities, public authorities which prosecute administrative offences entailing fines and the German finance authorities.</li>
<li>Occasionally we depend on contractually affiliated external companies and external service providers to supply services such as the supply of advertising measures (only if you have given your explicit prior consent), processing payments (PayPal, credit card etc.), storing your data and customer service. In such cases, information is transferred to these companies or individuals in order to enable them to process this information further. We carefully select these external service providers and review them regularly to ensure that your privacy is preserved. The service providers may only use the data for the purposes stipulated by us. We also contractually require the service providers to treat your data solely in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the German data protection laws.</li>
<li>In order to further develop our business, we may alter the corporate structure of 6Wunderkinder GmbH by changing its legal form. We may also form, sell or buy subsidiaries, divisions or parts of the company. In such transactions, customer information together with the part of the company to be transferred will be passed on. Every time personal data are transferred to third parties to the extent prescribed, 6Wunderkinder will ensure that this is done in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the relevant data protection laws.</li>
