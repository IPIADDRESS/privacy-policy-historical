                <div class="sect"><p><strong>ACCEPTANCE
OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy
discloses the privacy practices for the Wufantuan websites (collectively, the
“Website”).Wufantuan is committed to protecting your privacy online. Please
read the following to learn what information we collect from you (“you” or the
“User” or the “End User”) and how we use that information. If you have any
questions about our privacy policy, please email us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE
READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR WEBSITE, YOU
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND TO ALL THE
TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR WEBSITE TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE
TO THESE TERMS, EXIT THIS PAGE AND DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Changes to Privacy
Policy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We
may change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revised Privacy
Policy in the “Privacy Policy” section of the Website. The revised Privacy
Policy is effective immediately when posted on the Website. It is the
responsibility of each User to review the Website and the Privacy Policy
periodically to learn of any revisions to this Privacy Policy. Your continued
use of the Website after the effectiveness of such revisions will constitute
your acknowledgment and acceptance of the terms of the revised Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Types of
Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We collect two types
of information about our Website Users: Personally Identifiable Information and
Non-Personally Identifiable Information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally
Identifiable Information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally
Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific End User.
When you engage in certain activities on the Website, such as creating an
account, ordering a product or service from us or our partners, submitting
content and/or posting content in discussion forums, entering a contest or
sweepstakes sponsored by us or our partners, filling out a survey, posting a
review, sending us or our partners feedback, requesting information about our
services, submitting an affiliate agreement, applying for a job, posting a
video or signing up for special offers from third parties through the Website
(collectively, “Identification Activities”), we may ask you to provide certain
information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an
Identification Activity. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity,
however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about
yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including postal
code), email address, telephone number and date of birth. When you order
products or services, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card
number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information.
Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is
identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not
provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it,
you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use Personally
Identifiable Information to provide products and services to you, administer
sweepstakes and contests, enhance the operation of the Website, improve our
marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website use, improve our product and
service offerings, and to tailor your experience with third parties as provided
in Item 3 of this Privacy Policy. For example, if you send our customer service
an email we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our
services, and may post your comment in our marketing materials or on our
Website. In addition, if you use our Website to send information or a product
to another person, we may store your personal information, and the personal
information of any recipient. We may use that other person's contact
information to allow him or her to view and accept your gift or to allow the
recipient to access the information you requested we send. We may also use
Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes,
accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you,
including our Website Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with
applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Personally
Identifiable Information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Personally
Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific End
User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource
Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the
URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you
are using and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. We, and/or our authorized
Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this
information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like
Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described in Items 4 and 8 of this
Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use Non-Personally
Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyze
trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and
cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information
with our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers to measure
the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.
Release of Personally Identifiable Information<br>
<br>
We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties
except as provided below: <br>
We may share your information with Wufantuan Merchants. From time to time, we
provide offers from particular merchants (referred to as “Wufantuan Merchants”)
who, as part of the offer, request information on Wufantuan customers who
purchased the offer. In those cases, we share some of your Personally
Identifiable Information with Wufantuan Merchants. Sharing this Information
will allow a Wufantuan Merchant to market directly to you should they choose to
do so. However, we will only share Personally Identifiable Information with a
Wufantuan Merchant if you engage in an Identification Activity, and then only
to the Wufantuan Merchant involved in that Identification Activity. We
specifically disclaim any responsibility or liability for the actions of such
Wufantuan Merchant. While we inform them that they are only permitted to
communicate with you for the purposes of the specific promotion with Wufantuan,
we do not have any responsibility for the actions of the Wufantuan Merchant,
and the actions of the Wufantuan Merchant are not in our control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may share your
information with Authorized Third Party Service Providers. We provide services
and products through third parties. These “Third Party Service Providers”
perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing our
administrative and promotional emails. We may share your Personally
Identifiable Information with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, deliver
packages, send postal or electronic mail, administer contests or sweepstakes,
remove repetitive information on customer lists, analyze data, provide
marketing assistance, provide search results and links, process credit card
payments, operate the Website, troubleshoot, and provide customer service. We
may also collect personal information from individuals and companies
(“Affiliates”) with whom we have business relationships and may share your
information with Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. We
encourage Wufantuan Merchants and Third Party Service Providers to adopt and post
privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information
by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not
subject to our control. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We
may remarket your information. Remarketing is a way for us to connect with
users, based upon your past interactions with the Site. Third-party marketing
vendors may be hired by Wufantuan to perform remarketing services. As a result,
third-party vendors, including Google, may show Wufantuan ads on sites on the
internet. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based
on a user's prior visits to Wufantuan 's website. Users may opt out of Google's
use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may share your
information in a Business Transfer. As with any other business, we could merge
with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company
would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable
Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject
to this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may share your
information for our Protection and the Protection of Others. We may also
disclose Personally Identifiable Information when we believe release is
appropriate to comply with the law or a court order; enforce or apply this
Privacy Policy, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the
rights, property or safety of the Website, its Users or others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.
Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may disclose or
share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Partners, Affiliates and
Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information
(which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) with “Third
Party Advertisers” or “Third Party Advertising Companies” and other parties as
provided below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use Third Party
Advertising Companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies
may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits to this and
other websites in order to provide, through the use of network tags,
advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Some of
these Third Party Advertising Companies may be advertising networks that are
members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also use Third
Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage
and volume statistical information from our Users to administer our Website and
constantly improve its quality. We may also publish this information for
promotional purposes or as a representative audience for Advertisers. Please
note that this is not Personally Identifiable Information, only general summaries
of the activities of our Users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is
owned and used by us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.
Updating and Correcting Information<br>
<br>
We believe that you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally
Identifiable Information you provide us. You may change any of your Personally
Identifiable Information by sending us an email at support [at] wufantuan.com
or writing to us at 172 Jin Xian
  Rd., Shanghai
P.R.C. 200020. Please indicate your name, address and email address, and what
information you would like to update when you contact us. </p>
<p>We encourage you to
promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. You may
ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however,
because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information
associated with past transactions on the Website. In addition, it may be
impossible for us to completely delete all of your information because we
periodically backup information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.
User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As discussed above,
you can always choose not to provide information, although it may be required
to engage in a certain activity on the Website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a condition of
purchase of our products and services, we will send you Administrative and
Promotional emails. We will send you information regarding your account
activity and purchases as well as updates about our products and promotional
offers. You cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. “Administrative Emails”
relate to a User's activity on the Website, and include emails regarding a
particular User's account, requests or inquiries, and purchases of products and
services. In contrast to Administrative Emails, however, you do have a choice
with respect to Promotional Emails. Promotional Emails advertise our products
and services, including exclusive sales and other offers, and/or the products
and services of our Advertisers and Affiliates. If you do not want to receive
Promotional Emails from us, you may elect to opt-out of receiving Promotional
Emails at any time after registering by e-mailing us at
support[at]Wufantuan.com, by writing to us at the address contained herein, or
by hitting the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of any of our e-mails. When
contacting us, please indicate your name, address, email address, and what
Promotional Emails you do not want to receive. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Security of
Information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We take security
seriously and take numerous precautions to protect the security of Personally
Identifiable Information. You can access your Personally Identifiable
Information on our Website through a password and your email address. This
password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not share your password with
anyone. In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information resides on a
secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have access to. We
encrypt certain sensitive information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
technology to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information is safe as
it is transmitted to us. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no
data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed
to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable
security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do
the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or
from the Website, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties
that may receive any such information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.
Data Tracking</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To facilitate and
customize your experience with the Website, we store cookies on your computer.
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a User's computer for
record-keeping purposes which contains information about that User. We use
cookies to save you time while using the Website, remind us who you are, and
track and target User interests in order to provide a customized experience.
Cookies also allow us to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from
you, like which pages you visited and what links you clicked on. Use of this
information helps us to create a more user-friendly experience for all
visitors. In addition, we may use Third Party Advertising Companies to display
advertisements on our Website. As part of their service, they may place
separate cookies on your computer. We have no access to or control over these
cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by our Website only and
does not cover the use of cookies by any Advertiser. Most browsers
automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser
settings to decline cookies. Please note that if you decline or delete these
cookies, some parts of the Website may not work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other Tracking
Devices</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may use other
industry standard technologies like pixel tags and web beacons to track your
use of our Website pages and promotions, or we may allow our Third Party
Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf. Pixel tags and web
beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Website, or in
our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific
action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and
web beacons generate a Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel
tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and
behavior on our Website, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and
performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons provided by our
Affiliates and/or Marketing Partners for the same purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.
Privacy Policies of Third Party Websites</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy
only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other
websites that may be accessible through this Website have their own privacy
policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. If you link to any
such website, we urge you review the website's privacy policy. We are not
responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.
Miscellaneous Privacy Issues</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minors under the age
of 18 may not use the Website. We do not collect or maintain information from
anyone known to be under the age of 18, and no part of the Website is designed
to attract anyone under the age of 18. Wufantuan does not sell products for
purchase by children. In certain instances, we sell children's products for
purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use the Site only with the
involvement of a parent or guardian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public Areas</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may provide areas
on our Website where you can publicly post information about yourself, can
communicate with others, or can review products, restaurants, and submit media
content. This information may be accessible by other consumers and companies
and may appear on other websites or web searches, and therefore this
information could be read, collected, and used by others. For example, if you
post your email address along with a public restaurant review, you may receive
unsolicited messages. We have no control over who reads your postings or what
other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so please use
caution when posting any personal information.</p>
