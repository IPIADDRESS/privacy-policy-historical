<h1>Visitor Privacy Statement</h1>

<h2>Automatic Data Collection</h2>
When a visitor requests a page of information from a web site, information
about the request is automatically stored in a log file.  This information 
includes
the address of the computer
making the request
(the Internet address, not the street address),
the time and date of the
request, the type of web browser being used, and sometimes, the page
from which the visitor is coming.  The information does <strong>not</strong>
contain the visitor's name or e-mail address, since the visitor's browser
does not provide this information to the web server.
<p>
WRAL OnLine analyzes these log files to learn about how visitors
are using the content on the site.  This information is used to
to allocate resources effectively and
improve the content of our site.
</p><p>


</p><h2>Voluntary Registration</h2>
Certain parts of WRAL OnLine require that visitors register by providing
their names, e-mail addresses, and other personal information, which
is recorded in databases on our servers.
<p>
This information is kept strictly confidential; it is not shared with or
sold to other companies.  It may, however, be used internally.  The
data may be used to send e-mail announcements of events on the site to users 
who registered for similar events.  The data may also be used for direct
mailings to WRAL viewers.
</p><p>
If you do not want to receive such mail, when you register for one of our
sections, you
may opt to not be included in mailings.  If a particular registration form
does not have this option, you can send mail to 
<a href="mailto:webmaster@wral-tv.com">webmaster@wral-tv.com</a>.  Please
include your name and the section for which you were registering so that
we can effectively remove you from the database.
</p><p>


</p><h2>Cookies</h2>
A cookie is simply a small piece of information that a web server asks your 
browser to store on your local computer, and then later your browser 
presents this information to the web server. In its simplest form, a cookie 
is just an identifying number. 
<p>
Some sites have sophisticated databases which link the cookie numbers
to personal information so that they could monitor exactly what a
particular visitor does on the web site.  It is important to note
that this personal information would have to be voluntarily provided
to the web site by the visitor (by filling out an online form).
</p><p>
WRAL OnLine uses cookies for anonymous visitor tracking.
WRAL OnLine's web server
assigns each visitor a unique numerical ID.  All requests for pages are tagged
with that ID, and by analyzing log files, we can determine how many
unique visitors used the site.
</p><p>
We do not know the identity
of a person based on the numerical ID.
The cookies used on WRAL OnLine do not contain any personal information 
about visitors, nor are they used to look up personal information about
visitors.  Even if you have entered information about yourself in one
of our registration forms, we do not relate that information to the
cookie data.
</p><p>
The advertisements displayed on our site may also make use of cookies.
When used by an ad rotation system, cookies help insure that when a visitor
clicks through on a randomly displayed advertisement, the visitor is taken
to the appropriate page.  Most of the ads on the site come from 
advertising bureaus which serve ads for a large number of web sites.
The advertising bureaus may have picked up personal
information about visitors (again, only if the visitor voluntarily
provides it) from other sites using the advertising bureaus.  The
advertising bureau may use the cookie and any related information
for a variety of purposes, including targeting ads by demographics or
direct marketing.
</p><p>
WRAL OnLine does not share any personal information provided by our
visitors with our advertising bureaus.
</p><p>

</p><h2>E-Commerce and Security in the WRAL Store</h2>
The WRAL Store uses First Union's SecureSales technology. SecureSales 
products are designed with state-of-the-art security. Sensitive information, 
such as credit card numbers and personalized pricing, are never sent "in the 
clear" over the Internet. For an added measure of security, customer records 
are stored behind two firewalls in encrypted databases. 
<p>
The personal data and credit card information you enter is done so on First 
Union's secure server, not on WRAL OnLine's server. The only information we 
receive is a report on the merchandise you ordered and your shipping address. 
We will not sell this information to third parties. 
</p><p>
The secure servers are based on 128 bit encryption, the highest levels of 
security in commercial use. As one of the largest bank holding companies 
in the country, First Union invested heavily in order to provide the highest 
level of security.
