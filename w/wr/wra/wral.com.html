<h1>Visitor Privacy Statement</h1>

<h2>Automatic Data Collection</h2>
When a visitor requests a page of information from a web site, information
about the request is automatically stored in a log file.  This information 
includes the address of the computer making the request
(the Internet address, not the street address),
the time and date of the
request, the type of web browser being used, and sometimes, the page
from which the visitor is coming.  The information does <strong>not</strong>
contain the visitor's name or e-mail address, since the visitor's browser
does not provide this information to the web server.
<p>
WRAL OnLine analyzes these log files to learn about how visitors
are using the content on the site.  This information is used to
to allocate resources effectively and
improve the content of our site.
</p><p>


</p><h2>Voluntary Registration</h2>
Certain parts of WRAL OnLine require that visitors register by providing
their names, e-mail addresses, and other personal information, which
is recorded in databases on our servers.
<p>
This information is kept strictly confidential; it is not shared with or
sold to other companies unless specifically noted on the registration
form.
Data supplied to WRAL may, however, be used internally to
assist us in learning more about our audience and their preferences.  The
data may be used to send e-mail announcements of events on the site to users 
who registered for similar events.  The data may also be used for direct
mailings to WRAL viewers.
</p><p>
If you do not want to receive such mail, when you register for one of our
sections, you may opt to not be included in mailings.  If a particular
registration form does not have this option, you can send mail to 
<a href="mailto:webmaster@wral-tv.com">webmaster@wral-tv.com</a>.  Please
include your name and the section for which you were registering so that
we can effectively remove you from the database.
</p><p>


</p><h2>Cookies</h2>
A cookie is simply a small piece of information that a web server asks your 
browser to store on your local computer, and then later your browser 
presents this information to the web server. In its simplest form, a cookie 
is just an identifying number. 
<p>
Some sites have sophisticated databases which link the cookie numbers
to personal information so that they could monitor exactly what a
particular visitor does on the web site.  It is important to note
that this personal information would have to be voluntarily provided
to the web site by the visitor (by filling out an online form).
</p><p>
WRAL OnLine uses cookies for anonymous visitor tracking.
WRAL OnLine's web server
assigns each visitor a unique numerical ID.  All requests for pages are tagged
with that ID, and by analyzing log files, we can determine how many
unique visitors used the site.
</p><p>
We do not know the identity
of a person based on the numerical ID.
The cookies used on WRAL OnLine do not contain any personal information 
about visitors, nor are they used to look up personal information about
visitors.  Even if you have entered information about yourself in one
of our registration forms, we do not relate that information to the
cookie data.
</p><p>
The advertisements displayed on our site may also make use of cookies.
When used by an ad rotation system, cookies help insure that when a visitor
clicks through on a randomly displayed advertisement, the visitor is taken
to the appropriate page.  Most of the ads on the site come from 
advertising bureaus which serve ads for a large number of web sites.
The advertising bureaus may have picked up personal
information about visitors (again, only if the visitor voluntarily
provides it) from other sites using the advertising bureaus.  The
advertising bureau may use the cookie and any related information
for a variety of purposes, including targeting ads by demographics or
direct marketing.
</p><p>
WRAL OnLine does not share any personal information provided by our
visitors with our advertising bureaus.
</p><p>

</p><h2>E-Commerce and Security in the WRAL iShop</h2>
WRAL OnLine has partnered with Shop The Country in Atlanta, Ga., to
provide complete e-commerce services, including customer service, secure
online ordering, credit card processing and order fulfillment.
<p>
We know that security is important to you, and as a result, Shop The
Country made safeguarding your information its top priority.
ShopTheCountry.com is fully equipped with a secure server for all online
transactions. All transactions and credit card information are encrypted
using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) Protocol. This ensures that your credit
card information is encrypted throughout the entire process. Therefore,
this system is very secure, and you need not be concerned about someone
accessing your credit card (or any other) information.
</p><p> 
In order to protect our customers, we verify all orders placed over $500.
We will contact you after your order is placed for verification before we
process your order and charge your credit card.
</p><p>
