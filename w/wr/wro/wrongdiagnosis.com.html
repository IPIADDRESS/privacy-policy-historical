<p><b><font face="verdana,arial,geneva" size="4">Privacy Policy</font></b></p>
<p>
As patients ourselves, we understand that health matters
are very personal and need to be kept private.
Your privacy is
important to WrongDiagnosis.Com and we are committed to protecting that
privacy. 
This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices
for WrongDiagnosis.Com.



<a name="overview"></a></p><p><a name="overview"><b><font face="verdana,arial,geneva" size="3">Overview</font></b></a></p><a name="overview">
<p>
Generally speaking, we do not attempt to gather
personal information except as required to administer
the site and provide any services that you may have asked for.
Specific details of certain privacy issues are discussed
in subsequent sections.
In general, our privacy practices can be summarized as follows:
</p></a><ul><a name="overview">
<li>
We do not sell or distribute personally identifiable information.

We only share aggregate statistical information (if any)
with our advertisers, affiliates, or partners.

</li></a><li><a name="overview">Personal information such as email addresses or shipping addresses
obtained from you through purchases
from our </a><a href="../cgi-bin/clicktracker.cgi?http://www.amazon.com/shops/wrongdiagnosis">Amazon.com Zshop</a>
 
may be used by
us for opt-out newsletters or other marketing purposes.
</li><li>
In many cases we do not even have your personally identifiable information
and make no attempt to get it.
Ordinary viewing of public WrongDiagnosis.Com pages does not log anything
other than standard web server logs (e.g. IP address, page viewed, date and time),
and we make no attempt to identify you from this information.
Credit card details for orders at our <a href="../cgi-bin/clicktracker.cgi?http://www.amazon.com/shops/wrongdiagnosis">Amazon Zshop</a> are handled by Amazon.com and are
not seen by us.
For ordinary Amazom.com referral book sales that bypass our Amazon Zshop,
we do not gather personal information or credit card details.



</li><li>WrongDiagnosis.Com does not track sessions for ordinary viewing of our site,
but may do so to allow entry to protected pages
such as membership-only pages or credit card purchased documents.
</li><li>WrongDiagnosis.Com does not use cookies, but our advertisers may.



</li></ul>
<p>
The following sections discuss these issues in further detail.




<a name="logs"></a></p><p><a name="logs"><b><font face="verdana,arial,geneva" size="3">Log Files</font></b></a></p><a name="logs">
<p>
Most internet sites collect basic data in log files
on web servers.
When you perform an action at our web site,
such as viewing a HTML page,
the following information is typically collected
by standard web server configuration,
and may be logged by our web servers:
</p><ul>
<li>IP address
</li><li>Page requested (i.e. which document is viewed)
</li><li>Referrer page (where did you come from, if arriving from a link to us)
</li><li>Date and time
</li><li>Web browser type and version (e.g. Netscape versus Internet Explorer)
</li><li>Other technical information
</li></ul>
</a><p><a name="logs">
<b>IP addresses:</b>
Whenever you access the Internet, all
computers are assigned IP addresses to allow computers and servers to recognize
and communicate with each other.
These are usually written as 4 numbers separated by dots,
such as 12.34.56.78, where each number is in the range 0 to 255 inclusive.
IP addresses are not linked to personally
identifiable information.
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, 
administer the site, 
and gather broad demographic information for
aggregate use.
For example, we may need to determine
how many "unique visitors" our site has had,
and from which countries the visitors came.
We may use IP addresses combined with pages visited
to track user movement through a site,
but only on an aggregate basis
to determine which web pages are most used,
and which paths through the site are the most useable.
However,
WrongDiagnosis.Com may use IP addresses in special cases,
such as to identify visitors who refuse to
comply with our terms of use or who may threaten our service, site, customers
and others.



</a><a name="cookies"></a></p><p><a name="cookies"><b><font face="verdana,arial,geneva" size="3">Cookies</font></b></a></p><a name="cookies">

<p>
WrongDiagnosis.Com does not use cookies.
However, our advertiser partners may use cookies,
though we have neither control of nor access to the data from these cookies.
WrongDiagnosis.Com does not attempt to create or access cookies
or to match cookies to any other personally identifiable information.

</p></a><p><a name="cookies">
<b>What is a cookie?</b>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing
information about the user, 
such as which activities they conducted while on
our site.
Cookies are temporary files created during a web session;
once the
user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates.
It is also possible to configure your web browser to reject cookies
should you so wish.

Any Personal Information provided to

the terms of this Privacy Statement, unless you are otherwise notified. 
In the
following limited circumstances we will consider, and may release, Personal
Information to third parties: 
(1) to comply with valid legal requirements such

This site does not currently accept credit card details directly.
Instead, our partners such as Amazon.com process credit card transactions
without distributing this information to us.
For example, credit card details for orders at our </a><a href="../cgi-bin/clicktracker.cgi?http://www.amazon.com/shops/wrongdiagnosis">Amazon Zshop</a>
are handled by Amazon Payments and are not seen by us.
Email and shipping addresses are provided for us to ship product,
but we do not see your billing details.
Furthermore, for ordinary Amazom.com book, magazine or other referral sales that bypass our Amazon Zshop,
we do not even receive email addresses or personal information, let alone credit card details.
If for any reason we do receive your credit card details,
we will use such information only in order to perform credit card verification
and transaction approval.
Our partners that collect credit card information
may use this information in accordance
with their own privacy or other policies
and this is beyond our control.
