Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you-businesses, consumers and the
general public-in understanding how we collect and use the personal information
you provide to us, and to help you make informed decisions when using our web
site and all of our related services therein.</p><h6 class="mt20 mb20">Contact Information</h6><p>
To request a correction or deletion of your private information, or if you have
any questions and general comments about this privacy policy, please contact us:

When visiting the our web site, you may provide us with two types of information:
personal information you voluntarily choose to disclose that is collected on an
individual basis, and Web site use information gathered on a collective basis as
you and others browse our Web site.</p><p><strong>Personal Information You Choose to Provide</strong></p><p><strong>Registration Information</strong></p><p>You will provide us information about yourself, your firm or company, and your
practices when you register to be a user of our services, register for certain
services, or register for email newsletters and alerts.</p><p><strong>Email Information</strong></p><p>If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of
your email messages together with your email address and our responses. If you
use our "Email this page" feature to send a copy of that page to someone else,
your email address will appear as the sender of the email. Both your email
address and the recipient's email address will not be used for any other
purpose.</p><h6 class="mt20 mb20">How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</h6><p>
Generally, we use personal information for purposes of managing and expanding our
business activities, providing customer service and making available other
products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally,
we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes
to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will find
valuable.</p><p>
Choice/Opt-out</p><p>
We allow you the choice to opt-out of having your information used for purposes
not directly related to our site, when we ask for the information.</p><p></p><p>
Until you explicitly opt-in for the first time we consider you in the opt-out
category. We always notify our customers when their information is being
collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed
choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an
outside party.</p><p>
If you do not wish to receive any promotional or marketing e-mails and/or surface
mail marketing letters, you may opt-out of receiving those communications by
using the opt-out mechanism on the User Account Settings Web page, or by sending
an e-mail with the subject line "Unsubscribe" to or e-mail address - see
above.</p><h6 class="mt20 mb20">What Are Cookies?</h6><p>
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique
identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer
for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically
designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if
your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser
only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the
cookies sent to you by other sites.</p><h6 class="mt20 mb20">How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</h6><p>
As you visit our Web site, the site uses its cookies to differentiate you from
other customers. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from seeing
unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in more than is necessary for
security.</p><p>
Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate
the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site
are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve
our Web site and better serve our customers. Cookies do not allow us to gather
any personal information about you and we do not generally store any personal
information that you provided to us in your cookies.</p><h6 class="mt20 mb20">Sharing Information with Third Parties</h6><p>
We may enter into alliances, partnerships or other business arrangements with
third parties who may be given access to personal information including your
name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing you
information regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to
you.</p><p>
In connection with alliances, partnerships or arrangements, we may also provide
certain information to third parties if we have determined that the information
will be used in a responsible manner by a responsible third party.</p><p>
We also use third parties to facilitate our business, including, but not limited
to, sending email and processing credit card payments. In connection with these
offerings and business operations, our partners and other third parties may have
access to your personal information for use in connection with business
activities.</p><p>
As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings.
Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred
business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such
information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or any
dissolution.</p><h6 class="mt20 mb20">How Do We Protect Your Information?</h6><p>
Secure Information Transmissions</p><p>
Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this reason, we
request that you do not send private information to us by email. Some of the
information you may enter on our Web site may be transmitted securely via Secure
Sockets Layer SSL, 128 bit encryption services. Pages utilizing this technology
will have URLs that start with HTTPS instead of HTTP. Please contact
privacy@writework.com if you have any questions or concerns.</p><h6 class="mt20 mb20">How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</h6><p>
You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we
collect online and maintain in our database by contact us, see the above contact
information.</p><h6 class="mt20 mb20">What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</h6><p>
We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from
our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to
other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may
be useful to the users of our Web site. Please remember that when you use a link
to go from our Web site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in
effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including Web sites
which have a link on our Web site, is subject to that Web site's own rules and
policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p><h6 class="mt20 mb20">Your Consent</h6><p>
By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal
information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we change our privacy
policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our Web site to keep you
aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances
we may disclose it. At any time you may request to view any and all changes and
updates, via surface mail.</p><h6 class="mt20 mb20">Notification of Changes</h6><p>
The Privacy Policy is subject to periodic review and change. In order to view the
current Privacy Policy, simply check this section of the website. If we
materially change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy
statement and other places we deem appropriate so users are aware of what
information we collect, how it is used, and under what circumstances, if any, we
disclose it. In some cases where we post a notice, we may also email user who
have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in
our privacy practices.</p><h6 class="mt20 mb20">Do you share visitor information with 3rd parties?</h6><p>
The only information WriteWork.com may share with any 3rd party is general
statistical information concerning the browsing patterns and target audience for
specific pages of our site. We do NOT give out specific user information such as
e-mails, names and addresses. In fact, we consider such information so precious,
we are not willing to part with it for any cost.</p><p>
We may from time to time annouce big changes or improvements on WriteWork.com
via email. We know that some people get very annoyed with this, so it will always
be possible opt-out of these info-mails. And no, we don't send mails to people
who have nothing to do with our services.</p><p>
You are our customers, and we value your loyalty - we will never wish you to be
bothered by SPAM e-mail or any other kind of unsolicited e-mail potentially
caused by sharing such information with a 3rd party.</p><p>
As big supporters of OpenSource software (and frequent visitors to sites such as
<a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot.org</a>) you can easily imagine where
we stand on this personally.</p></div><div id="contentbottom"></div>
