<h3>2. Cookies</h3>
<p>When you visit the Site, we may place a "cookie," a small

  to help us recognize and serve you better when you return. Usage of
  a cookie is in no way linked to personally identifiable information

  drawback to this is that you will be limited in some areas of our Site.
  Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users
  to enhance the experience on our Site. Some of our business partners
  use cookies on our Site (e.g., advertisers). However, we have no access
  to or control over these cookies.</p>


<h3>3. Choice</h3>
<p>When you provide personally identifiable information to us, you will
  be able to choose whether we may disclose such information in a personally
  identifiable form to a third party or whether the information may be
  used in personally identifiable form for purposes different from the
  purposes for which it was originally collected or that you have subsequently
  authorized.</p>
<p>You will have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications
  from us when we first request your personal information. You can also
  opt out of receiving further communications from us by sending an e-mail
  to <a href="mailto:optout@turnitin.com">optout@turnitin.com</a></p>
<p>You can request removal of your personally identifiable information
  from our databases by contacting us as noted in Section 12 (Notices)
  below. To honor your request, we will need the exact information you
  want removed, and information sufficient for us to identify the type

  with such measures, no one is able to guarantee that unauthorized third
  parties will not be able to bypass these measures or otherwise capture
  information you provide over the internet.</p>

<h3>7. Data Integrity</h3>
<p>We will take reasonable steps to see that the personal information

  who have agreed to provide a continuing adequate level of protection
  through participation in the Safe Harbor program or one of the other
  means permitted under EU Directive 95/46 EC and implementing Member
  State laws.</p>
<p>If you have any concern or complaint regarding Turnitin's compliance
  with the Safe Harbor Principles, please contact Turnitin as noted in
  Section 12 (Notices) below. Turnitin will investigate your concern
  or complaint and will attempt to resolve the matter with you. If you
  do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not

  at <a href="mailto:info@oakland.bbb.org">info@oakland.bbb.org</a>.
  BBBOnLine will then serve as a liaison with Turnitin to resolve your
  concerns.</p>

  time. Please check the Privacy Pledge when you use the Site to ensure
