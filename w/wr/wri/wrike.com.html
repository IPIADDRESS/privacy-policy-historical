				<h3>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><div>This policy covers how Wrike treats personal information that Wrike collects

					an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make
					the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the
					ad. </div></li>
