		<br>
		<h2>
			Summary</h2>
		<p>
			At F+W, our goal is to offer products and services that will allow our customers
			to lead fuller, richer lives. The same holds for how we communicate with you and
			how we handle your personal data. It's important to us that you understand what
			information we collect, how we protect it, and how we use it — and to provide
			clear instructions if you choose to request changes in how we communicate with you.</p>
		<h2>

			Our postal address is:</p>
		<address>

		<h2>
			Information We Collect</h2>
		<h3>
			Information about your computer hardware and software</h3>
		<p>
			For each visitor to our web site, our web server automatically recognizes your IP
			address. The address allows our server to deliver the information you request from
			us, such as an article or a form for posting to a discussion board. We also collect
			visitors' IP addresses in their domain-name form, allowing us to understand for
			instance how many customers access our site through various service providers. We
			collect this information on an individual basis and in aggregate, or combined, form.</p>
		<p>
			We also collect both user-specific and aggregate information on what pages consumers
			access or visit. We use the information to improve the content of our web pages,
			to customize the content and layout of our pages, and to notify consumers about
			updates to our site.</p>
		<p>
			We use cookies to store visitors' preferences, record session information such as
			items that consumers add to their shopping cart, record user-specific information
			on what pages users access or visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might
			be of interest to them when they return to our site, record past activity at a site
			in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, ensure that
			visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, and to customize Web page
			content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends.
			(We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.)</p>
		<h3>
			Email address, postal address, telephone number</h3>
		<p>
			If at any time you provide us with your email address to place an order or access
			a service, we collect that information. Areas we may collect your email address
			include but are not limited to discussion boards; chat areas; product or service
			transactions; emails you send us; and interactive forms. If you supply us with your
			postal address online, you may receive periodic mailings from us and carefully selected
			partners with information on new products and services.</p>
		<p>
			Customers who supply us with their telephone numbers online may receive telephone
			contact from us with information regarding new products and services or upcoming
			events. We do not rent telephone contact information to third parties.</p>
		<p>
			Finally, we keep any information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information
			and/or site registrations, both in aggregate and personally identifiable ways.</p>
		<p>
			If you do not wish to receive emails from us, please let us know by using the response
			device that can be found at the bottom of every email we deliver.</p>
		<p>
			If you do not wish to receive mail or telephone calls from us, please let us know
			by sending your request to: WritersMarket.com, c/o F+W Publications, 4700 E. Galbraith,
			Cincinnati, OH 45236. Please provide your name, address, and telephone number, and
			we will honor your request to be removed from our contact list. Please allow 30
			days for us to process your request.</p>
