                            On some Wiliam web sites, you can subscribe to different events 
              and seminars, make requests, and register to receive materials. 
              The types of personal information collected at these pages are name, 
              contact and some preference information.<br>
              <br>
              In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously 
              improve our products and services (including registration), we may 
              also ask you to provide us with information regarding your professional 
              interests, demographics and more detailed contact preferences.<br>
              <br>
              Our electronic newsletters record anonymous data about articles 
              you have expressed interest in. Some wiliam.com.au web pages use 
              cookies, a data analysis technique.<br>

                            Wiliam uses your information to better understand your needs and

              contact or client.<br>
              <br>
              From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you 
              for market research or to provide you with marketing information 
              we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we will 
              always give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such direct 
              marketing or market research contact. We will also follow local 
              requirements, such as allowing you to opt in before receiving unsolicited 
              contact, where applicable.<br>

              Your permission is always secured first, should we ever share your

              data so that you may view, update or correct your information.<br>
              <br>
              To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable 
              steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling 
              you to make corrections. To access your personally identifiable 
              information, return to the web page where you originally entered 
              it and follow the instructions on that web page. To opt-out of Wiliam 
              contact, provide your name, email and/or address and relevant information 
              about subscriptions or registrations you may have with Wiliam.<br>
              <br>
              This opt-out will cancel all marketing and support communication 
              and newsletters, including offline subscriptions. Certain areas 
              of Wiliam's Web sites may limit access to specific individuals through

              <b><span class="heading">9. How Wiliam uses cookies</span></b><br>
              <br>
                            A cookie is a piece of text asking permission to be placed on your 
              computer's hard drive. If you agree, then your browser adds the 
              text in a small file. The purpose of a cookie is to help us analyse 
              Web traffic or let us know when you visit a particular site.<br>
              <br>
              Cookies allow a Web application to respond to you as an individual. 
              By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, 
              the Web application can tailor its operation to your needs, likes 
              and dislikes. For example, when you visit an electronic store, a 
              cookie makes it easy to shop by allowing you to drop things into 
              a shopping cart; the cart itself is not the cookie, the cookie is 
              placed on your hard drive and keeps track of your cart versus others' 
              in use at the same time.<br>
              <br>
              Wiliam uses traffic log cookies to identify what pages are being 
              used and which ones aren't. This helps us aggregate and analyse 
              data about Web page traffic and make improvements to wiliam.com.au 
              web to better meet our visitor, contact and client needs. In this 
              case, Wiliam uses this information only for statistical analysis 
              purposes and then the data is removed from the system. That is the 
              case of many of our support and information-sharing pages and forums. 
              Denial of a traffic log cookie should not prevent you from using 
              one of these sites.<br>
              <br>
              A few wiliam.com.au Web sites use temporary cookies as part of the 
              customer web navigation experience, tracking unique IDs for that 
              particular Web site session only.<br>
              <br>
              Examples are newlsetter registration sites. This cookie, by itself, 
              only tells us that a previous wiliam.com.au visitor, contact or 
              client has returned. If you deny the cookie, you can still use the 
              site anonymously. At client.wiliam.com.au, you will receive a persistent 
              cookie. Clients (and users of Wiliam's online client system) can 
              browse some areas of client.wiliam.com.au with cookies turned off, 
              but you can only browse the secure area of the site if you accept 
              the cookie.<br>
              <br>
              Overall, cookies help us give you a better web site to use, by letting 
              us monitor what's working and what isn't through site traffic analysis. 
              Wiliam wants to be sure you understand that accepting a cookie in 
              no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information 
              about you, other than the data you chose to share with us. This 
              practice is strictly enforced. We know that a lot of people have 
              concerns about cookies, but in talking with many of our visitors, 
              contacts and clients, we believe that the benefit we both gain from 
              their proper use is worthwhile. We value the relationships we have 
              with our visitors, users and clients, so we respect these concerns. 
              Wiliam works to continuously improve the wiliam.com.au Web experience 
              and personal data privacy policy and practices.<br>
              <br>
              You may set your Web browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape 
              Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests or decline 
              cookies completely. You can delete the files that contains cookies; 
              those files are stored as part of your Internet browser.<br>
