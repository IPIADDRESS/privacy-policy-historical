                  </p>
                  <p>A cookie is a piece of text asking permission to be placed 
                    on your computer's hard drive. If you agree, then your browser 
                    adds the text in a small file. The purpose of a cookie is 
                    to help us analyse Web traffic or let us know when you visit 
                    a particular site.<br>
                    <br>
                    Cookies allow a Web application to respond to you as an individual. 
                    By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, 
                    the Web application can tailor its operation to your needs, 
                    likes and dislikes. For example, when you visit an electronic 
                    store, a cookie makes it easy to shop by allowing you to drop 
                    things into a shopping cart; the cart itself is not the cookie, 
                    the cookie is placed on your hard drive and keeps track of 
                    your cart versus others' in use at the same time.<br>
                    <br>
                    Wiliam uses traffic log cookies to identify what pages are 
                    being used and which ones aren't. This helps us aggregate 
                    and analyse data about Web page traffic and make improvements 
                    to wiliam.com.au web to better meet our visitor, contact and 
                    client needs. In this case, Wiliam uses this information only 
                    for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed 
                    from the system. That is the case of many of our support and 
                    information-sharing pages and forums. Denial of a traffic 
                    log cookie should not prevent you from using one of these 
                    sites.<br>
                    <br>
                    A few wiliam.com.au Web sites use temporary cookies as part 
                    of the customer web navigation experience, tracking unique 
                    IDs for that particular Web site session only.<br>
                    <br>
                    Examples are newlsetter registration sites. This cookie, by 
                    itself, only tells us that a previous wiliam.com.au visitor, 
                    contact or client has returned. If you deny the cookie, you 
                    can still use the site anonymously. At client.wiliam.com.au, 
                    you will receive a persistent cookie. Clients (and users of 
                    Wiliam's online client system) can browse some areas of client.wiliam.com.au 
                    with cookies turned off, but you can only browse the secure 
                    area of the site if you accept the cookie.<br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, cookies help us give you a better web site to use, 
                    by letting us monitor what's working and what isn't through 
                    site traffic analysis. Wiliam wants to be sure you understand 
                    that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your 
                    computer or any personal information about you, other than 
                    the data you chose to share with us. This practice is strictly 
                    enforced. We know that a lot of people have concerns about 
                    cookies, but in talking with many of our visitors, contacts 
                    and clients, we believe that the benefit we both gain from 
                    their proper use is worthwhile. We value the relationships 
                    we have with our visitors, users and clients, so we respect 
                    these concerns. Wiliam works to continuously improve the wiliam.com.au 
                    Web experience and personal data privacy policy and practices.<br>
                    <br>
                    You may set your Web browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer 
                    or Netscape Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests 
                    or decline cookies completely. You can delete the files that 
                    contains cookies; those files are stored as part of your Internet 
                    browser.<br>
