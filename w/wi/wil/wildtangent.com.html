Our Privacy Policy covers what information we collect through our products and services, how this information is used, how you may opt-out of this collection, the security measures we take to protect this information, and our policy regarding children under 13 years of age.

By using our products and services, you consent and agree to the information collection and practices described in our Privacy Policy.  We may periodically make changes to our Privacy Policy.  It is your responsibility to review the most recent version of our Privacy Policy frequently and remain informed about any changes to it.  The most recent version of our Privacy Policy can always be found at:<br><br><a target="_new" href="http://www.wildtangent.com/default.asp?pageID=wildtangent_privacy">http://www.wildtangent.com/default.asp?pageID=wildtangent_privacy</a><br><br><br><span class="paragraphTitle">What Information Does WildTangent Collect?</span><br><br><br><b>When Downloading WildTangent Products</b><br>
The term "personally identifiable information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, address, email address, phone number, or other contact information.  You may be asked for certain personally identifiable information when accessing a particular product or service.  Occasionally, and only with your consent, we may share this information with select third parties. At the time you are asked for this information, you will be informed of the following: 
<br><br><span class="paragraphTitle"></span><br><ul>
<li>What specific personally identifiable information is being shared with the select third party.</li>
<li>The identity of the select third party.</li>
<li>A link to the privacy statement of the select third party, if available.</li>
</ul>The shared information is subject to the select third parties' privacy statement.  We will not resell or disclose this information to anyone other than the select third party.  Should you decide not to share this information for a particular product or service, you may not be able to access the product or service, however, this will not affect your ability to access other products and services.  We will not be responsible or liable if a third party violates its privacy statement.   
<br><br><b>When Purchasing WildTangent Products and Services</b><br>
When you purchase a WildTangent product or service from us, we collect standard payment and billing information, including your billing address, for use in processing the payment transaction.  We do not resell or share this payment information with other companies or third parties. 
<br><br>We may retain the services of certain outside contractors to perform services on our behalf (for example, to help provide technical support services, to deliver new game technology, or to administer the delivery of emails to users).  At times, we must disclose relevant personally identifiable information about you to our contractors so they may provide specific services for us.  We require our contractors to keep this information confidential and to only use the information on our behalf.  For purposes of this Privacy Policy, these contractors are not considered "select third parties" and we may disclose personally identifiable information to these contractors without providing notice to you.

<li>Receipt of a message</li>
<li>Number of times a particular message is viewed and clicked on </li>
</ul>We use this information to better understand how the GameChannel service is used and what types of products are most popular with our users.
