                    <p>Wild About Movies Entertainment’s Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how Wild About Movies LLC, its subsidiary and affiliate corporations, successors, and assigns (collectively referred to as “Wild About Movies”) uses and protects the information you provide. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to this World Wide Web site and any other websites owned or operated by Wild About Movies or that may be subsequently added, variations or successors to this website (www.WildAboutMovies.com, the “Wild About Movies Sites”), any Wild About Movies computer software downloadable or otherwise available from the Wild About Movies Sites (“Wild About Movies Software”) and any Wild About Movies services purchased or otherwise made available from the Wild About Movies Sites (“Wild About Movies Services”) (collectively, the “Wild About Movies Properties”). This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all Users (“Users”) of the Wild About Movies Properties.</p>
<p>A. WHAT INFORMATION Wild About Movies COLLECTS FROM YOU</p>
<p>Wild About Movies may collect two (2) types of information about you: Personal and Non-Personal.</p>
<p>1. “Personal Information.” Personal Information refers to information that lets Wild About Movies know the specifics of who you are and which may be used to identify, contact or locate you (e.g. name, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address).

<p>2. “Non-Personal Information.” Non-Personal Information refers to information that, by itself, does not identify you as a specific individual (e.g. demographic information or website visitations). Wild About Movies may collect Non-Personal Information through any of the methods discussed above as well as automatically through use of industry standard technologies described further below.</p>
<p>B. HOW Wild About Movies COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION</p>
