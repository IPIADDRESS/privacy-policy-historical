<p>Wild About Movies Entertainment’s Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how Wild About Movies LLC, its subsidiary and affiliate corporations, successors, and assigns (collectively referred to as “Wild About Movies”) uses and protects the information you provide. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to this World Wide Web site and any other websites owned or operated by Wild About Movies or that may be subsequently added, variations or successors to this website (www.WildAboutMovies.com, the “Wild About Movies Sites”), any Wild About Movies computer software downloadable or otherwise available from the Wild About Movies Sites (“Wild About Movies Software”) and any Wild About Movies services purchased or otherwise made available from the Wild About Movies Sites (“Wild About Movies Services”) (collectively, the “Wild About Movies Properties”). This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all Users (“Users”) of the Wild About Movies Properties.</p>
<p>A. WHAT INFORMATION Wild About Movies COLLECTS FROM YOU</p>
<p>Wild About Movies may collect two (2) types of information about you: Personal and Non-Personal.</p>
<p>1. “Personal Information.” Personal Information refers to information that lets Wild About Movies know the specifics of who you are and which may be used to identify, contact or locate you (e.g. name, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address). Wild About Movies may collect Personal Information when you use the Wild About Movies Properties including, without limitation, setting up account information, filling out surveys, corresponding with Wild About Movies, or otherwise volunteering information about yourself.</p>
<p>2. “Non-Personal Information.” Non-Personal Information refers to information that, by itself, does not identify you as a specific individual (e.g. demographic information or website visitations). Wild About Movies may collect Non-Personal Information through any of the methods discussed above as well as automatically through use of industry standard technologies described further below.</p>
<p>B. HOW Wild About Movies COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Personal Information practices set forth apply to all of Wild About Movies’s visitors worldwide.</p>
<p>1. Registration. Prior to using one or more of the Wild About Movies Properties, Wild About Movies may require certain Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to create an individual account (“Account”) or to enable features or functionality of the Wild About Movies Properties. Failure to provide all required information required by Wild About Movies may prevent access to any or all Wild About Movies Properties, and failure to maintain accurate information may result in suspension or termination of access to any or all Wild About Movies Properties.</p>
<p>2. Information Collected Through Technology. While you are able to visit the Wild About Movies Sites and remain anonymous, Wild About Movies or its third party service providers may still collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the Wild About Movies Properties (e.g. your Internet browser, operating system, IP address, connection speed, and the domain name of your Internet service provider). Such information may be gathered by the following methods:</p>
<p>(a) Cookies. Cookies, including local shared objects, are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive which work by assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of the Wild About Movies Sites. Cookies do not generally contain any Personal Information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your browser to prevent this. Not accepting cookies may make certain features of the Wild About Movies Properties unavailable to you. Wild About Movies respects the user’s wish for anonymity and avoiding cookies.</p>

These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</p>
<p>(b) IP Address. You may visit many areas of the Wild About Movies Sites anonymously without the need to become a registered User. Even in such cases, Wild About Movies may collect IP addresses automatically. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you begin Services with an Internet services provider. Each time you access the Wild About Movies Sites and each time you request one of Wild About Movies’s pages, the server logs your IP address.</p>
<p>(c) Web Beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in web pages and e-mails.

The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is Personal Information.</p>
<p>(d) Tracking Content Usage. If you use the Wild About Movies Services and you post audio visual materials including, without limitation, text, logos, artwork, graphics, pictures, advertisements, sound and other related intellectual property contained in such materials (collectively, “Content”) to your website or to a third party website, Wild About Movies tracks and captures Non-Personal Information associated with User accounts and the use of Content.</p>

<p>1. System Administration. Wild About Movies may use Non-Personal Information for the purposes of system administration, assisting in diagnosing problems with Wild About Movies servers, monitoring Wild About Movies’ system performance and traffic on the Wild About Movies Properties and to gather broad demographic information about Wild About Movies visitors.</p>
<p>2. Personalization. Wild About Movies uses Cookies and IP Addresses to track features such as delivering Content specific to your interests and informing you of new, relevant services or certain third party offerings.</p>
<p>3. Notices to Registered Users. If you have registered for an Account, Wild About Movies may use your Personal Information to send e-mails regarding your registration, including confirmation to verify the accuracy of any information you have provided, and instructions on how to post Content.

<p>5. Promotional E-mails. Wild About Movies may use your Personal Information to send you e-mails periodically listing promotions or events relating to the Wild About Movies Properties or from Wild About Movies’s marketing partners or sponsors.
