          Information you may provide in  visiting our Site falls into two broad categories: personally identifiable information  and aggregate information. "Personally Identifiable Information" is  information that can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name,  credit card information, email address, or mailing address. "Aggregate  Information" is information that does not identify you, and may include,  for example, statistical information concerning the web pages on our Site that  users most frequent. Our Privacy Policy governs both categories of information,  as detailed below.<br>
          <a href="http://www.wilsonlanguage.com/WLT_Privacy_Policy.html#top">Back to top</a><br clear="all">
  <br>
  <a name="anchor2" id="anchor2"></a><strong>2. Information That Identifies You: Personally  Identifiable Information</strong><br>
          We allow you to decide whether you  wish to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information. Accordingly, we  have structured our Web Site so that you may visit us, and review a range of  information about educational programs and services offered by WLT without  revealing your identity or providing any Personally Identifying Information. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>2A. Applicant and Credit Card  Information</strong> <br>
          Our primary means of gathering  personal data are our on-line registration application and our material order  form. In the Application Form people who wish to register for a program offered  by WLT may be asked to provide Personally Identifiable Information including  but not limited to first and last name, birth date. The data obtained through  the Application Form is used internally at WLT and possibly by an associated  college or university for the purpose of providing course credits. <br>
          Please note that on occasion Wilson  Language Training Corporation (WLT) receives inquiries as to whether an  individual is certified in Wilson or has otherwise participated in Wilson  Professional Learning. Our policy is to not disclose personal information  with regard to participants in our programs. WLT will, however, unless  specifically requested in writing otherwise, share information regarding  certification and the level of participation in our professional learning  programs. <br>
          When you provide information on our  Material Order Form to make a purchase, the transactional information that you  provide is transmitted in a safe, encrypted format. WLT uses SSL (Secure Socket  Layer) technology, an industry-standard protocol used to establish secure  communications between a web server and a client. We also currently support  encryption- the most secure way currently available to protect your credit card  information. To maintain your security, your encrypted credit card information  is sent to the credit card authority and approval status is sent back to us.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>2B. Email, Direct Communications and  Other Forms</strong> <br>
          You may have the ability at our Site  to pose certain questions to staff in order to learn more about services  offered by WLT. You may wish to provide us with comments and feedback concerning  our Site generally. By communicating with us in these ways, you may provide us  with your email address, and other Personally Identifiable Information. All  data collected is secured at the highest level of security available to our web  server. <br>

          <a name="anchor3" id="anchor3"></a><strong>3.  We Use Your Contact Information to Keep You Informed</strong> <br>
          We may use Personally Identifiable  Information you give to us to provide you with information concerning our programs  and services, newsletters, updates, and related materials. We may also use this  Information to respond to questions and comments from you, and to inform you of  changes to our Privacy Policy. <br>
          You may opt out of receiving email  or other information from us or have your Personally Identifiable Information  deleted from our database by following the directions set out in Section 7  ("How to Remove Your Information from Our Database"). <br>
          We will not sell or disclose any  Personally Identifiable Information you provide at our Site to any unrelated  third party without your express permission. <br>

          <a name="anchor4" id="anchor4"></a><strong>4.  Information That Does Not Identify You: Aggregate Information</strong> <br>
          When you browse our Site, the  choices you make may provide information concerning your interests, and  concerning the appeal and efficacy of associated Site features. Information  concerning our visitors' activities at our Site - which pages they visit, and  how long they view these pages, for example - is Aggregate Information. This  information does not identify a particular user, but does provide potentially  useful data. <br>
          <strong><br>
          4A. Cookies</strong> <br>
          We may collect Aggregate Information  about your use of our Site through cookies and similar Internet technologies.  If we use cookies, they do not collect or retain your name or other Personally  Identifying Information. In addition, no third parties are permitted to use  cookies we may create at our Site for their own purposes. We treat all  information that may be collected through cookies and similar Internet  technologies as Aggregate Information.<br>
          <strong><br>
          4B. Disabling Cookies</strong> <br>
          You may choose not to allow us to  collect information in this manner, through cookies. If you wish, you can set  your browser software to reject cookies. Most browsers provide instructions for  disabling the cookies feature in their "Help" section. Because  cookies can be used to provide certain functionality, if you disable your  browser's cookies feature, certain elements of our Site may be unavailable to  you. <br>
          <strong><br>
          4C. IP Addresses </strong> <br>
          A so-called "Internet  Protocol" (IP) address is associated with your computer's connection to  the Internet. We may use your computer's IP address to maintain contact with  you as you navigate through our Site. We also may use your computer's IP  address to provide you with personalized content. Similar to cookies, your  computer's IP address by itself does not identify you personally. <br>

          <a name="anchor5" id="anchor5"></a><strong>5.  We Use Aggregate Information Only In Ways That Do Not Identify You</strong> <br>
          We may share Aggregate Information,  and reports based on this Information, with third parties unrelated to the  Site. No information which we provide to third parties will allow anyone to  identify you, or determine anything personal about you. For example, we might  report to unrelated third parties the number of users of our Site. <br>

          <a name="anchor6" id="anchor6"></a><strong>6.  How We Safeguard Information We Collect</strong> <br>
          It is our intent to protect against  the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you.  We use a variety of current technologies and processes for protection of our  customer data. These systems are structured to deter and prevent hackers and  others from accessing this information. Due to the nature of Internet  communications and evolving technologies, however, we cannot provide, and  disclaim, assurance that the information you provide us will remain free from  loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain  unauthorized access. <br>

          <a name="anchor7" id="anchor7"></a><strong>7.  How to Remove Your Information from Our Database</strong> <br>
          If you request, we will remove your  name and other Personally Identifiable Information from our databases. Please  understand, however, that it may be impossible to remove this information  completely, due to backups and records of deletions. If you wish to remove your  name and other Personally Identifiable Information from our database, please  create an email with the term "Remove" in the subject line, and send  the email to the address listed in Section 15 ("Contact Us"). As an  alternative, you may write to us with your request, at the mailing address  listed in Section 15. Please note, however, that some information may be  required to be retained by WLT for a certain time period for tax reporting  purposes.<br>
          Because Aggregate Information does  not personally identify our users, we do not provide our users with access to  Aggregate Information, and users may not update, revise, or delete any  Aggregate Information. <br>

          <a name="anchor8" id="anchor8"></a><strong>8.  Privacy Protection for Children </strong> <br>
          Our Site is not directed at  children, and we will not accept or request personal information from  individuals we know to be under 13. In accordance with the Children's Online  Privacy Protection Act of 1998, if we learn that a child under 13 has provided us  with Personally Identifiable Information, we will delete this information from  our databases. <br>

          <a name="anchor9" id="anchor9"></a><strong>9.  Participation in Online Discussions</strong> <br>
          If we have a "chat" or  "forum" feature on the Site, you may decide to participate in an  online discussion. Please keep in mind that any information you provide while  participating in an online chat or forum will be available to all participants.  These participants, and their transferees, may use Personally Identifiable  Information and other information you disclose in this manner, to contact you  and for other purposes. Accordingly, if we choose to provide such features at  our Site, we ask that you participate prudently, as this Privacy Policy will  not cover the information you disclose in online discussions at our Site. <br>

          To give you access to other helpful  information we may provide links to other sites. We provide these links as a  convenience, and WLT does not endorse the content or services offered by, or  the privacy policies in place at, these other sites. <br>
          Our privacy policy covers only  information we collect at our Site. Other sites to which we link may have  privacy policies that differ considerably from our Privacy Policy. We have  structured our Site to make it reasonably clear when you leave our Web Site and  enter another web site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of each  site you visit through our links, to ensure you are comfortable with these  policies. We are not responsible for the conduct or policies of these third  parties.<br>

          <a name="anchor11" id="anchor11"></a><strong>11.  Court Orders, Subpoenas, and Other Required Disclosures</strong> <br>
          There are two exceptions to our  Privacy Policy. First, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information as  may be required in legal proceedings, or in response to a subpoena, court  order, or administrative order compelling disclosure. Second, in cases  involving a threat of imminent harm to you or others, we may release such  information to prevent or mitigate the threat. In any such case, we will seek  to limit the scope of disclosure, and will disclose only such information as is  reasonably required to fulfill the purpose of the disclosure. <br>
          As previously stated, upon request  by a third party and without otherwise disclosing personally identifiable  information, we may share information regarding certification and level of  participation in our professional learning programs unless we receive a  written request from the participant to not share this information.<br>

          From time to time we may revise our  Privacy Policy and we reserve the right to change it at any time. We will  notify registered users of these changes, and will post the changes here. Any  changes to our Privacy Policy will apply prospectively, and we will maintain  Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with the version of the  Policy in effect at the time you submitted the information, unless you consent  to application of the revised Policy.<br>
