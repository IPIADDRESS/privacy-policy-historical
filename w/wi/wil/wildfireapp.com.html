    <h1>Wildfire Privacy Policy</h1>

    <div class="privacy-policy-content">

      <p class="last-updated">
        <em>Last Updated: February 27, 2013</em>
      </p>
      
      <p>Your privacy is important to Wildfire Interactive, Inc. ("Wildfire"). This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to the Wildfire Web sites ("Sites"). This Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Wildfire.</p>

      <p>We also make services and technology available to our customers that allow them to promote their brands and products to consumers (“Applications”).  If we collect information (including personal information) through our Applications for a customer, we may store and process that information for the customer.  This Policy does not apply to the collection of information through our Applications.  To learn about how a Wildfire customer uses the information it collects through our Applications, please see its privacy policy.</p>

      <h2>Personal Information Collected</h2>

      <p>We collect information from you in various ways when you use our Sites. We may collect personal information you directly provide on our Sites. Information we may collect includes name and email address, and phone number.</p>


      <p>In addition, when you visit our Sites some information may be automatically collected. For example, it is standard for your Web browser to automatically send information to every Web site you visit including ours. That information includes your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language, and referring Web site addresses. We may also collect information about your computer's operating system and information about your usage and activity on our Sites. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user-base as a whole.</p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>

      <p>We may automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small data files that are stored on your hard drive by a Web site. Among other things, the use of cookies helps us to improve our Sites and your experience. We use cookies to see which areas and features are most popular, to count the number of computers accessing our Sites, to personalize your experience, and to remember your preferences.</p>
      
      <p>We link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. If your browser is set not to accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you may not be able to access certain features or services of our Sites. The use of cookies by our service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our service providers use session ID cookies to collect data in order to enable us to provide a better user experience.</p>

      <h2> Web Beacons </h2>

      <p> We and our third party partners use Web beacons that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons, also known as gifs, are electronic images that may be used on our Sites or in our emails. A Web beacon may be used on our Web pages to collect information, deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, or in our emails to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications. </p>

      <h2>Use Of Personal Information We Collect</h2>

      <p> We use your personal information to provide you with services, to operate and improve our Sites , to send you messages, and for other purposes described in this Policy or disclosed to you on our Sites or in connection with our services.

        <li>to apply to become a partner;</li>

        <li>to personalize and improve your experience on our Sites;</li>

        <li>to respond to comments and questions and provide customer service;</li>

        <li>to deliver service messages and other services and content you request and to send information related to accounts and services, including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;</li>

      Wildfire may store and process personal information in the United States and other countries.  <p></p> 

      <h2>Sharing Of Personal Information</h2>

      <p>We use third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill you for services, an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf, a company to provide our forums and an employment resources company to process your job applications. When you sign up for our services, we will share the personal information you provide only as necessary for the third party to provide that service.</p>
