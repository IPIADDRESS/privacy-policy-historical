<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

privacy policy ("Policy") explains when and how personal information
is collected, used, and disclosed with respect to our web site located at <a href="http://www.wishpot.com" title="www.wishpot.com">www.wishpot.com</a> (the
"Site"). [By using the Site, you consent to the privacy practices
described in this Policy, as modified from time to time by us. <b>We reserve
the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time.&nbsp; We will alert
you that changes have been made by indicating on the privacy policy the date it
was last updated. </b>&nbsp;<b>Your use of the Site following the posting of such
changes or revised statement shall constitute your consent to any changes in
our privacy practices.</b>&nbsp; Please carefully review this policy whenever you

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"><b><span style="font-size:18.0pt;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">As used herein, the term "personal
information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such
as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other account number),
and information about that individual's activities, such as information about
his or her use of the Site, when directly linked to personally identifiable
information. &nbsp;Personal information also includes demographic information such
as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information
is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal
information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate
information is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or
category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or
other personal information has been removed. In other words, information about
how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how
others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our
users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor
our Site. &nbsp;This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of
aggregate information.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"><b><span style="font-size:18.0pt;

an entry&nbsp; or (4) contact us by e-mail for any reason. &nbsp;Personal
information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection
with creating a profile, leaving comments, providing a review, inviting a
friend, sending an email or message to another user or participating in any
interactive forums or features on the site.&nbsp; In addition, from time to time we
may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you provide in
connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games,
promotional offers, and other activities on the Site.&nbsp; </span></p>

any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in
the aggregate only. &nbsp;We may also automatically collect certain information
