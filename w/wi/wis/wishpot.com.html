<p><b>Last Revised: November 10, 2006</b></p>

<p>This
privacy policy ("Policy") explains when and how personal information
is collected, used, and disclosed with respect to our web site located at <a href="/">www.wishpot.com</a> (the
"Site"). [By using the Site, you consent to the privacy practices
described in this Policy, as modified from time to time by us. <b>We reserve
the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time.Ã¡ We will alert
you that changes have been made by indicating on the privacy policy the date it
was last updated. Your use of the Site following the posting of such
changes or revised statement shall constitute your consent to any changes in
our privacy practices.</b>Ã¡ Please carefully review this policy whenever you
visit our Site so you understand our data privacy practices and can make an
informed decision about using our Site.</p>

<h2>What is Personal Information?</h2>

<p>As used herein, the term "personal
information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such
as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other account number),
and information about that individual's activities, such as information about
his or her use of the Site, when directly linked to personally identifiable
information. Ã¡Personal information also includes demographic information such
as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information
is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal
information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate
information is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or
category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or
other personal information has been removed. In other words, information about
how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how
others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our
users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor
our Site. Ã¡This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of
aggregate information.</p>

<h2>Personal Information We Collect </h2>

<p>We collect personal information in a number of
ways when you visit our Site. At several places on our Site, we may collect
certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal
information.Ã¡ For example, we collect personal information, such as your name, address,
photograph and other contact and demographic information when you: (1) register
and set up an account; (2) sign up for any of our e-mail newsletters; (3) post
an entry&nbsp; or (4) contact us by e-mail for any reason. Ã¡Personal
information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection
with creating a profile, leaving comments, providing a review, inviting a
friend, sending an email or message to another user or participating in any
interactive forums or features on the site.Ã¡ In addition, from time to time we
may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you provide in
connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games,
promotional offers, and other activities on the Site.</p>

<p>When you visit our web site, some information is
also automatically collected, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP)
address, your computer's operating system, the browser type, the address of a
referring web site, and the time and date of your visit and purchases. We treat
this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to
any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in
the aggregate only. Ã¡We may also automatically collect certain information
through the use of "cookies."Ã¡ For more information on how we use
cookies and other information that we automatically collect, please see the
section below entitled "Cookies, IP Addresses and URLs"</p>
