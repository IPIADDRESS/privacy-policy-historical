<p>
  This
privacy policy ("Policy") explains when and how personal information
is collected, used, and disclosed with respect to our web site located at <a href="/">www.wishpot.com</a>
  (the
"Site").  By using the Site, you consent to the privacy practices
described in this Policy, as modified from time to time by us.<b>
    We reserve
the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time.   We will alert
you that changes have been made by indicating on the privacy policy the date it
was last updated. Your use of the Site following the posting of such
changes or revised statement shall constitute your consent to any changes in
our privacy practices.</b>
  Please carefully review this policy whenever you
visit our Site so you understand our data privacy practices and can make an
informed decision about using our Site.</p>

<h2>
  What is Personal Information?</h2>

<p>
  As used herein, the term "personal
information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such
as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other account number),
and information about that individual's activities, such as information about
his or her use of the Site, when directly linked to personally identifiable
information.   Personal information also includes demographic information such
as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information
is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal
information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate
information is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or
category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or
other personal information has been removed. In other words, information about
how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how
others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our
users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor
our Site.   This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of
aggregate information.</p>

<h2>
  Personal Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
  We collect personal information in a number of
ways when you visit our Site. At several places on our Site, we may collect
certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal
information.   For example, we collect personal information, such as your name, address,
photograph and other contact and demographic information when you: (1) register
and set up an account; (2) sign up for any of our e-mail newsletters; (3) post
an entry or (4) contact us by e-mail for any reason.   Personal
information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection
with creating a profile, leaving comments, providing a review, inviting a
friend, sending an email or message to another user or participating in any
interactive forums or features on the site.   In addition, from time to time we
may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you provide in
connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games,
promotional offers, and other activities on the Site.</p>

<p>
  When you visit our web site, some information is
also automatically collected, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP)
address, your computer's operating system, the browser type, the address of a
referring web site, and the time and date of your visit and purchases. We treat
this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to
any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in
the aggregate only.   We may also automatically collect certain information
through the use of "cookies".   For more information on how we use
cookies and other information that we automatically collect, please see the
section below entitled "Cookies, IP Addresses and URLs"</p>

<h2>
  How We Use Personal Information</h2>

other personal information we maintain about you. In either case, this Policy

<h2>
  Public Postings, Content and Ratings</h2>

<p>
  You can publish a wish list on the Site as well
as publishing various comments, reviews and other content on various portions
of the Site . Members can choose to rate products, services or other wishes,
and to connect to other members. As an unregistered visitor, we do not allow
you to rate products and/or reviews or to enter comments.</p>

<p>
  Certain information that you post on the Site
may be displayed publicly and shared with other users, I such as items on your
wish list, reviews, comments, and your user profile.   Your use of the Site
constitutes your consent to share this information publicly.   You may elect to
restrict access to certain information, such as your profile and wish list, by
using the available privacy settings.   Please be aware, however, that although
we use commercially reasonable efforts to implement these restrictions and
honor these designations, no system or security measure is perfect or impenetrable,
and therefore, we cannot guarantee that this information will not be available

discussion groups, email, or any other interactive areas of the Site that are
not designated as private, or other information that is provided for the

anyone.   In addition, your member name is automatically displayed
with wishes and comments you publish, and if other members choose to, they
can receive email notifications of your publications or publish their own comments
to your items.</p>

<p>
  We publish product ratings and use them to
develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views and merchandise products. We
use your items, comments and reviews to personalize the site and
identify/feature popular members. For example, we may promote most popular items
and members. While we don't expect to transfer the complete review and member
database to others (except as contemplated elsewhere in this statement), we use
the database throughout our networks and to generate results for others.</p>

measures in an effort to protect personal information while it is under our

<h2>
  Sharing of Personal Information</h2>

<p>
  We do not sell, rent or share personal
information with third parties without your prior consent except in the limited
circumstances described in this Policy (and in any updates to this policy that

information to third parties without your authorization.   We may share personal
information with third-party vendors, consultants and service providers ("Service

business. These functions may include, without limitation, Website hosting. We endeavor
to limit the information shared with such Service Providers to that which we

responsible for any failure on the part of our Service Providers to comply with
our privacy practices, nor are we responsible for any additional information
you provide directly to these Service Providers or to other third parties, and
we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing
information directly to them.</p>

<p>
  When you participate in the Site, certain
information you post on or through the Site may be shared with other users or
posted on publicly available portions of the Site, and your use of the Site
constitutes your consent to share this information in such manner.   For more
information on how certain information you post on or through the Site may be
shared with others or be publicly available, please see the Section above on Public
Postings, Content and Ratings.   Please keep in mind that if you directly

be collected and used by others. You agree that we shall bear no responsibility
for any such disclosures whether by Wishpot or any third party. We recommend
you be cautious in giving out personal information to others in public online
