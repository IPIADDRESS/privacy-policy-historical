<span>Last Revised: October 17, 2017</span>
<p>WiseStamp Ltd. and its affiliates d/b/a WiseBrand (<strong>“WiseBrand”, “Company”, “we” </strong> or <strong>“us”</strong>) respects the privacy of the visitors and/or users of its Sites, Platform and related Services (<strong>“User” </strong> or <strong>“you”</strong>) and is committed to protect the personal information that you share with us. We believe that you have a right to know our practices regarding the information we may collect and use when you visit and/or use our Services.</p>
<p>Capitalized terms which are not defined herein, shall have the meaning ascribed to them in our Terms of Use at <a href="http://wisebrand.co/terms-of-use/" target="_blank">http://wisebrand.co/terms-of-use/</a> (“TOU”), into which this Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference.</p>
<h2>Your Consent (PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!)</h2>
<p><strong>BY ENTERING, CONNECTING TO, ACCESSING OR USING THE SITES AND/OR PLATFORM AND/OR BY USING THE SERVICES (AS SUCH TERMS IS DEFINED IN THE TOU), YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY (THE “PRIVACY POLICY”), INCLUDING TO THE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION (AS DEFINED BELOW). IF YOU DISAGREE TO ANY TERM PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITES AND/OR PLATFORM AND/OR SERVICES.</strong></p>
<p><strong>FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, PROCESSING, TRANSFER AND USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE AND CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE US WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS VOLUNTARILY PROVIDED TO US.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE YOU WITH OUR SERVICES, YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO LINK WITH THE SERVICES YOUR E-MAIL ACCOUNT OPERATED BY A THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER, THROUGH OPEN STANDARD FOR AUTHORIZATION (OAUTH), AND GRANT US CERTAIN ACCESS PERMISSION TO YOUR EMAIL ACCOUNT. TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, YOU HEREBY GRANT WISEBRAND ACCESS TO, AND THE ABILITY TO EXTRACT CERTAIN DATA WHICH ARE HELD IN YOUR EMAIL ACCOUNT AND/OR COPY SUCH MATERIALS AND DOCUMENTS, AS NECESSARY. PLEASE NOTE – WE WILL EXTRACT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM YOUR EMAIL ACCOUNT SOLELY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE YOU WITH OUR SERVICES.&nbsp;WE DO NOT SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH ANY THIRD PARTY FOR MARKETING PURPOSES WHATSOEVER.</strong></p>
<h2>Which information we may collect on our Users?</h2>
<p>We may collect two types of data and information from our Users:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Non-identifiable and anonymous information (<strong>“Non-personal Information”</strong>). <strong>We are not aware of the identity of the User from whom we have collected the Non-personal Information.</strong> Non-Personal Information is any unconcealed information which does not enable identification of an individual User, and which is available to us while such User is using the Services. Non-personal Information which is being gathered consists of technical information, behavioral information and aggregated information, and may contain, among other things, the activity of the User on the Sites and Platform, type of operating system, User’s ‘click-stream’ or searches on the Sites and Platform, type and version of browser, keyboard language, screen resolution, traffic source, etc.</p>
<p>In addition, we may collect Non-personal Information included in e-mails exchanged using email accounts that are associated with the Platform (including e-mails that do include the Signature generated by the Platform), such as impersonal information (including metadata) associated with your emails in your email account, emails that were opened and/or hyperlinks clicked by the recipient(s) and information contained in commercial electronic mail messages and transactional messages.</p></li>
<li>Personally identifiable information (<strong>“Personal Information”</strong>). <strong>This information may identify an individual or may be of a private and/or sensitive nature.</strong></li>
<li>We gather the Users’ IP address (or Mac Address, as applicable) and/or advertiser identifier (when available on a device) mainly to detect anomalies for security purposes (i.e., in order to safeguard our Sites). We note that WiseBrand may collect, use and provide access to the User’s advertising identifier in accordance with the applicable policies.</li>
<li>In addition, Personal Information which is being gathered consists of any personal details you provide consciously and voluntarily:</li>
<ul>
<li>Personal Information you supply for the creation of Brandings (such as name, email address, phone number, text, pictures, etc.), or published directly via the Platform and/or incorporate into your Branding, and any additional details that you may choose to add to your Branding.</li>
<li>Incorporated Content which is derived from Social Networks by your integration of the Platform and Service with your Social Network Account (as detailed below). For example: you may grant WiseBrand access to Facebook account in order for us to continually pull your Facebook ‘status’ to allow constant updates of your Branding with your current status.</li>
When opening an Account, you may be required to provide the following details: full name, email address and a password. You may (but are not required to) provide us with additional details.
<li>You may, alternatively, open an Account and signup to the Service via your existing third party Social Networks accounts (e.g. Facebook) (“Social Network Account”). Social Network Accounts integration may also be used by the users for integration of Incorporated Content into their Branding and the provision of our Services (e.g. WiseStats). Please note that you may integrate your Account with several Social Network Accounts.</li>
<li>In the event that you register to the Service through your existing Social Network Account or integrate your existing Social Network Accounts with the Platform, then such Social Network Account provides us with access to certain information that is stored in the your Social Network Account, which is detailed and displayed to you in the notice which appears during the integration process with such Social Network Account. Please read carefully such notice in order to understand what information is made available to us via your Social Network Account. We may collect your login information and other relevant information necessary to enable us to access your Social Network Account in order to collect the abovementioned data contained within your Social Network Account which you provided us access to. We may store the above-mentioned information (or any part of it), in order to achieve the purposes set forth herein. Please remember that the manner in which Social Networks use, store or disclose your information is governed solely by their policies and we will have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of such Social Networks. If you do not agree to these practices please do not use the Social Network integration features. You hereby agree that such information will be stored even after the linkage to your Social Network Account expires, for any reason.</li>
<li>Some of our Services, namely WiseStamp and WiseStats, require that you link your Account with one or more of your email accounts (e.g. Gmail), and by creating such link, you give us your consent to access such e-mail account, which may contain data and information which is of a sensitive nature. Please note that we may automatically scan, analyze, identify and extract certain Personal Information from such e-mail accounts for the sole purpose of providing you with our Services. Such access rights to your email accounts granted to WiseBrand are displayed to you in the notice which appears during the integration process with such email account. Please read carefully such notice in order to understand what information is made available to us via your email account.</li>
<li>In addition, to the extent that you wish to subscribe to a Premium Account or Corporate Account or purchase services from our Third Party Service Operators via the Platform, you will have the option to use certain Online Payment Processors which will require you to fill out a billing form wherein you will be required to provide to such Online Payment Processors certain Personal Information (such as, a credit card number and other related billing information) (see section 6 below regarding the payment method). We will not store such information on our servers. We only keep token information such Online Payment Processors provide us with, and such information is strictly secured.</li>

</ul>
</ul>
