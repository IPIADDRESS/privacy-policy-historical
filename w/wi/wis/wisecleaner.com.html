		  <h1>WiseCleaner Privacy Statement</h1>
            <p>WiseCleaner is committed to protecting your privacy. please read the 
            WiseCleaner Online privacy Statement below and also any supplemental information 
            listed to the right for additional details about particular WiseCleaner sites 
            and services that you may use.</p>            
            <p>This WiseCleaner Online privacy Statement applies to data collected by 
            WiseCleaner through the majority of its Web sites and services, as well as its 
            offline product support services. It does not apply to those WiseCleaner sites, 
            services and products that do not display or link to this statement or that have 
            their own privacy statements.</p>     
		  <h2>Collection of Your Personal Information</h2>  
            <p>In order to access some WiseCleaner services, you will be asked to sign in 
            with an e-mail address. If you have purchased our product(s), in order to save 
            your purchase informations, your name and email will be save to our users 
            database.</p>  
            <p>We may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, 
            the links you click and other actions taken in connection with WiseCleaner sites 
            and services. We also collect certain standard information that your browser 
            sends to every website you visit, such as your Ip address, browser type and 
            language, access times and referring Web site addresses.</p>                      
          <p>In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your 
            interactions with WiseCleaner, information collected through one WiseCleaner 
            service may be combined with information obtained through other WiseCleaner 
            services. We may also supplement the information we collect with information 
            obtained from other companies. For example, we may use services from other 
            companies that enable us to derive a general geographic area based on your Ip 
            address in order to customize certain services to your geographic 
            area.</p>
			<h2><b>Use of Your Personal Information</b></h2>  
            <p>WiseCleaner collects and uses your personal information to operate and 
            improve its sites and deliver the services or carry out the transactions you 
            have requested. These uses may include providing you with more effective 
            customer service; making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the 
            need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and 
            analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and 
            displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and 
            preferences.</p>  
            <p>We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send 
            certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing 
            reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. 
            Some WiseCleaner services, such as WiseCleaner Newsletter, may send periodic 
            member letters that are considered part of the service. We may also occasionally 
            send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products 
            or services available from WiseCleaner and its affiliates.</p>            
            <p>personal information collected on WiseCleaner sites and services may be 
            stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which 
            WiseCleaner or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and 
            by using a WiseCleaner site or service, you consent to any such transfer of 
            information outside of your country. WiseCleaner abides by the safe harbor 
            framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the 
            collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.</p>                        
           <h2>Sharing of Your Personal Information </h2> 
            <p>Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal 
            information outside of WiseCleaner and its controlled subsidiaries and 
            affiliates without your consent. Some WiseCleaner sites allow you to choose to 
            share your personal information with select WiseCleaner partners so that they 
            can contact you about their products, services or offers. Other sites do not 
            share your contact information with third parties for marketing purposes, but 
            instead may give you a choice as to whether you wish to receive communications 
            from WiseCleaner on behalf of external business partners about a partner's 
            particular offering (without transferring your personal information to the third 
            party).</p> 
            <p>Some WiseCleaner services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with 
            another company. If you register for or use such services, both WiseCleaner and 
            the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the 
            co-branded services.</p>            
            <p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our 
            behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing 
            customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing 
            statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to 
            obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are 
            required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited 
            from using it for any other purpose.</p>           
            <p>We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such 
            action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on 
            WiseCleaner; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of WiseCleaner 
            (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent 
            circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of WiseCleaner services or 
            members of the public.</p>     
            <h2>Security of Your Personal Information</h2>
            <p>WiseCleaner is committed to protecting the security of your personal 
            information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help 
            protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. 
            For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems 
            with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we 
            transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or 
            password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such 
            as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>    
            <p>If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, 
            it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this 
            information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should 
            always choose to log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to 
            your information from subsequent users.</p>
            <h2>Collection and Use of Children's personal Information</h2> 
            <p>WiseCleaner cares about children and understand that they have special 
            privacy needs. Therefore, WiseCleaner has adopted the following privacy policy 
            regarding children:</p>                       
            <p>WiseCleaner will NOT collect, use, or distribute to third parties personally 
            identifiable information without prior verifiable parental 
            consent.<br>WiseCleaner will NOT entice the child to divulge more information 
            than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service.<br>WiseCleaner 
            will provide the parent a description of the specific types of a personally 
            identifiable information collected from their child upon request. WiseCleaner 
            will allow the parent to refuse further use or future online collection of 
            personally identifiable information and provide a way for a parent to obtain any 
            personally identifiable information collected from their child.<br>WiseCleaner 
            will NOT provide any links to web sites that are unsuitable for children.<br>Use 
            of Cookies</p>            
            <p>WiseCleaner Web sites use "cookies" to enable you to sign in to our services 
            and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file 
            that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies contain 
            information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the 
            cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your 
            computer.</p> 
            <p>WiseCleaner Web sites use cookies to store your preferences and other 
            information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need 
            to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your personalized 
            content and appropriate advertising on your later visits to these sites.</p>  
            <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers 
            automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to 
            decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be 
            able to sign in or use other interactive features of WiseCleaner sites and 
            services that depend on cookies.</p>  
            <h2>Use of Third party Ad Networks </h2>  
                <p>The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on WiseCleaner Web 
                pages are displayed by WiseCleaner. However, we allow other companies, called 
                third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on WiseCleaner 
                Web pages. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your 
                computer in order to recognize your computer each time they send you an online 
                advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, 
                or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine 
                which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver 
                targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. 
                WiseCleaner does not have access to the cookies that may be placed by the 
                third-party ad servers or ad networks.</p>     
                <h2>Controlling "Spam" or Unsolicited E-mail </h2>    
                <p>WiseCleaner is concerned about controlling unsolicited commercial e-mail, or 
                "spam." WiseCleaner has a strict Anti-Spam policy prohibiting the use of 
                customer account to send spam. WiseCleaner will not sell, lease or rent its 
                e-mail subscriber lists to third parties. While WiseCleaner continues to 
                actively review and implement new technology, such as expanded filtering 
                features, there is no currently available technology that will totally prevent 
                the sending and receiving of unsolicited e-mail. Using tools such as the Inbox 
                protector and being cautious about the sharing of your e-mail address while 
                online will help reduce the amount of unsolicited e-mail you 
                receive.</p>   
                <h2>Enforcement </h2> 
                <p>WiseCleaner regularly reviews its compliance with this policy. please feel 
                free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this policy or WiseCleaner's 
                treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site. When 
                we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is WiseCleaner's policy 
                to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate 
                with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection 
                authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data 
                that cannot be resolved between WiseCleaner and an individual.</p>                                            
                <h2>Changes to This privacy Statement </h2>   
                <p>We will occasionally update this privacy statement to reflect changes in our 
                services and customer feedback. When we post changes to this Statement, we will 
                revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this statement. If there are 
                material changes to this statement or in how WiseCleaner will use your personal 
                information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such 
                changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a 
                notification. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be 
                informed of how WiseCleaner is protecting your information.</p>   
                <h2>Contacting Us </h2>
                <p>WiseCleaner welcomes your comments regarding this privacy statement. If you 
                have questions about this statement or believe that we have not adhered to it,
