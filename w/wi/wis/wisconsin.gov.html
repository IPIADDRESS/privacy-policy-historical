State of Wisconsin laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government.  At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records provided by both state and federal laws.   These exceptions include the privacy of individuals. 
<br>
<p> Information collected at this site becomes public record and may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exception in law exists.   During your visit to Wisconsin.gov information that is not readily identifiable to an individual is automatically collected and stored.  This information is used solely to improve our web services.

<h4><a name="Information"></a>Information Collected and How It is Used</h4>
<p>If you do nothing during your visit to Wisconsin.gov but browse or download 

information, we automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
The Internet Protocol address and domain name used 
  but not the email address. The Internet Protocol address is a numerical 
  identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to 
  your computer. We use the Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic 
  to you; <br>
  
 </li><li>The type of browser and operating system you used and 
  your connection speed; 
  
 </li><li>The date and time you visited this site;
  
 </li><li>The web pages or services you accessed at this site;and 

  
 </li><li>The web site you visited 
        prior to coming to this web site.</li></ol>

The information we automatically collect or store is used to improve 
the content of our web services and to help us understand how people are 
using our services. Wisconsin.gov analyzes our web site logs to 
continually improve the value of the materials available on our site. 
Our web site logs are not personally identifiable, and we make no 
attempt to link them with the individuals that browse 
Wisconsin.gov.<br><br>

If during your visit to Wisconsin.gov you participate in a survey or send an email, the 

following additional information will be collected:
<ol>
<li>E-mail correspondence: The e-mail address and contents 
  of the e-mail; 
  
</li><li>Surveys :  Any information you volunteered in response to a survey.
</li></ol>

The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and 

graphic information formats you send us. The information is retained in accordance with Wisconsin 

Open Records Law.

<p>We use your email to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you, to address issues you 

identify, to further improve our web site, or to forward the email to another agency for appropriate 

action. Survey information is used for the purpose designated. </p>
<p></p><hr>

<h4><a name="Personal"></a>Personal Information and Choice </h4>
<p>"Personal information" is information about an individual that is readily identifiable to that 

specific individual. Personal information includes personal identifiers such as an individual's 

name, address, and phone number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered 

personal information. </p>
<p>We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily participate in an activity 

that asks for information (i.e. sending an e-mail or participating in a survey). If you choose not to 

participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other 

feature of Wisconsin.gov. </p>

<p>If personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered by the user, state law and 

the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once 

you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or 

state law.</p>

<p>Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by 

children on-line or by email will be treated the same as information given by an adult and may be 

subject to public access.</p>
<p></p><hr>

<h4><a name="Public"></a>Public Disclosure</h4>
<p>In the State of Wisconsin, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate 

records and information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to 

the public's right to access public records that serve various needs: the privacy of individuals 

is included among these exceptions. Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws. </p>

<p>We strive to protect personally identifiable information by collecting only information necessary 

to deliver our services. All information collected at this site becomes public record that may be 

subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption in law exists.</p>

<p>In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the Wisconsin Open Records Law or 

other law governing the disclosure of records, the Wisconsin Open Records Law or other applicable 

law will control.</p>
<p></p><hr>

<h4><a name="Access"></a>Access and Correction of Personal Information</h4>
<p>You can review any personal information we collect about you. You may recommend changes to your 

personal information you believe in error by submitting a written request that credibly shows the 

error. If you believe that your personal information is being used for a purpose other than what was 

intended when submitted, you may contact us. In all cases, we will take reasonable steps to verify 

your identity before granting access or making corrections. See Contact Information section.</p>

<h4><a name="Cookies"></a>Cookies</h4>

<p><b>What is a Cookie?</b></p>
<p>
A cookie is a small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and may either be used only during your session (a "session" cookie) or may be stored on your computer's hard drive (a "persistent" cookie). Cookies can contain data about user movement during the visit to the website.
If your browser software is set to allow cookies, a web site can send its own cookie to you.  A web site that has set a cookie can only access those cookies it has sent to you, it cannot access cookies sent to you by other sites. 
</p>

<p><b>Why are Cookies Used on Web Sites?</b></p>
<p>
Cookies are one mechanism for maintaining continuity during a user's visit to a web site. They allow data to be maintained for users' benefit as they navigate a site.  This is referred to as "session" or "state management" cookie.  These cookies go away when you terminate your visit to the website as they are maintained only in your browser's active memory during your session.
Cookies may also be stored on your computer so that you can be recognized by a website on subsequent visits. They can be read by the website that set them whenever you enter the website.  They are often used on websites that require you to log in to save you entering all of your log-in information.  They may store information on your unique identifier and the areas of the website you have visited before. These cookies are stored on your computer's hard drive after you have left your website visit and consequently are often referred to as "persistent" cookies.
</p>

<p><b>Choices about Cookies</b></p>
<p>
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) 
</p>

<p><b>Wisconsin.gov's Practices Regarding Cookies</b></p>
<p>
Wisconsin.gov uses only session cookies.  The information on these cookies is retained by the State only while the user's session is active in a table that lists the unique identifiers of those currently using the site. Currently session states are set to 30 minutes maximum. Wisconsin. Gov is using cookies for the following purposes: 
</p><ul>
  <li> Support the rotation of the home page's banner and "Featured Site" graphic.  <br><br>
  </li><li> When you "sign in" to the Employment section of Wisconsin.gov as either an employer or a job seeker. For job seekers, the cookie enables the session to be maintained as the user moves through different pages, such as updating a multi-page resume, previewing or showing the resume posted.  For employers, the cookies are used to establish the session state. 
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>Neither of these cookies are persistent and they contain no information about the user.</p>

<h4><a name="Security"></a>Security</h4>
<p>The Department of Administration, as developer and manager of Wisconsin.gov, has taken 

several steps to safeguard the integrity of its telecommunications and computing infrastructure, 

including but not limited to authentication, monitoring, auditing, and encryption. Security measures 

have been integrated into the design, implementation and day-to-day practices of the entire DOA 

operating environment as part of its continuing commitment to risk management.</p>

<p>This information should not be construed in any way as giving business, legal, or other advice. This information should not be construed as warranting as fail-proof the security of information provided through DOA supported web sites.</p>
<p></p><hr>

<h4><a name="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>Wisconsin.gov has links to other web sites. These include links to web sites operated 

by other government agencies, nonprofit organizations and private businesses. When you link to 

another site, you are no longer on Wisconsin.gov and this Privacy Notice will not apply. 

When you link to another web site, you are subject to the privacy policy of that new site.</p>
