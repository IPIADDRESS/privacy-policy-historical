<p><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong> Custodian of Records </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> The Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, and Senate Bill 1493, establish notification procedures concerning student records. Selected code sections and District procedures are included in this pamphlet in an effort to inform parents whose children are enrolled in the Weslaco ISD of their rights related to educational records. </p>

<p align="center"><a href="#top">Return to top</a></p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a name="p11"></a><strong> Parent Access </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Student cummulative records may be reviewed and inspected by the adoptive parent or legal guardian of a student or either natural parent in the presence of a certificated employee (even if there is a restraining order against the parent) unless a specific restriction to student records is ordered. However, only the parent who has legal custody of the student may challenge the contents of the records or authorize the release of records. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center"><a href="#top">Return to top</a></p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a name="p12"></a><strong> Student Access </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Students who have attained the age of eighteen years or who are attending an institution of post secondary education have the right to review and have access to records accorded to the parents. Students may contact their high school counselor concerning review and access to their records. </p>
<p> Students who are 16 years of age or older or have completed the 10th grade have the right to review their records. Such a review shall be for a specific educational purpose and shall be conducted in the presence of a certificated staff member. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center"><a href="#top">Return to top</a></p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a name="p13"></a><strong> Directory Information </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Directory information means one or more of the following items: Student's name, address, date and place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, picture, weight and height of members of athletic teams, grade average, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, and the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student. Using discretion based upon the best interest of the student, directory information may be released by the educational staff to local, state, county and federal agencies such as law enforcement, probation, protective, adoption, and health agencies, employers, scholarship award committees, private business or professional schools, military services recruitment representatives, or any public agency working on the behalf of minors. Parents are advised that, should they not want directory information to be released, they must notify the principal of the school in writing on an annual basis within thirty days after the first day of school enrollment. </p>

<p><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a name="p14"></a><strong> Types of Student Records </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Release of pupil information other than directory information to a person or agency requires the prior written consent of parents. The district will respond to subpoenas by sending the appropriate records to the court or the attorney representing the student. Types of student records, location, and person to contact are identified in this brochure for the convenience of parents and/or students 18 years or older who wish to give consent for the release of student records. </p>
