                <p class="style2">Ziff  Davis Enterprise is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes  the ways that personally identifiable and anonymous information about our  online users, event registrants and print subscribers is gathered, our  information sharing practices, and how online users and print subscribers may  request changes to the way this information is shared.</p>

                <p class="style4" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Personally Identifiable Information We Collect</p>

                <p class="style2" style="margin-top: 0;">We  collect personally identifiable information when you provide it to us, such as  when you subscribe to our magazines (either directly with us or through another  company such as a subscription agency), sign up for email newsletters, enter a  contest, register for site membership, participate in surveys, or to otherwise  communicate with us. Several of the services that we offer, including but not  limited to file downloads, message boards, eSeminars and the Web Buyer's Guide  require registration as a condition of use; when you register with one of our  sites you are no longer anonymous. We may also receive information about you  from other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us.</p>

                <p class="style4" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Information You Volunteer and How it Is Displayed to Others  Online</p>

                <p class="style2" style="margin-top: 0;">Ziff  Davis Enterprise is not responsible for the information you volunteer about  yourself in the course of discussions in our forums, chat rooms, or other forms  of publicly accessible interaction, or information that you choose to make  public in your member profile. As a member, you can view, correct or change your  publicly available information at any time via your member profile page.

                <h6 class="style5" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Statistical Reports and Analysis</strong></h6>

                <p class="style2" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Naturally,  the aggregate statistics that describe our print and online audience, which is  often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or  browse our sites, help us sell advertising and otherwise publicize Ziff Davis  Enterprise and its brands. The information we share under these circumstances  does not contain behavioral or identifying information about any individual  reader or user, unless the individual has given us permission to share that information.</p>

                <p class="style2" style="margin-top: 0;">We  make email and postal lists of our customers available on a rental, i.e.,  temporary, defined, basis, to carefully screened providers of quality goods and  services. Many customers appreciate the offerings they receive, but here's what  to do if you don't wish for us to share this information:</p>

                <ul class="style2">

                <p class="style2">Note:&nbsp; If you are a new subscriber, your information  may not be immediately available – please allow up to 4 weeks from placing your  subscription order for processing.</p>

                <ul class="style2">

                  <li>If you are a registered user of our sites, you       can change your preferences via the profile page links shown above.</li>

                  <li>If you are a registered user of Ziff Davis       eSeminars, please send email with your preference request to<a href="mailto:%20eSeminars@ziffdavisenterprise.com"> eSeminars@ziffdavisenterprise.com</a>. Please see below for details on       eSeminars's privacy policies. </li>

                  <li>If you've registered to attend a Ziff Davis       Enterprise face-to-face event and prefer this information not be shared,       please send email with your preference request to <a href="mailto:events@ziffdavis.com">events@ziffdavisenterprise.com</a>.</li>

                  <li>If you are a registered user of         Web Buyer's Guide and prefer this information not be shared, please send       email with your preference request to <a href="mailto:WebBuyersGuide@ziffdavisenterprise.com">WebBuyersGuide@ziffdavisenterprise.com</a>.</li>

                  <li>If you are a registered member of the       DeviceForge sites (including LinuxDevices.com, WindowsForDevices.com,       DeviceForge.com) and prefer your information not be shared, please send       email with your preference request to <a href="mailto:privacy@deviceforge.com">privacy@deviceforge.com</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p class="style2">Any  mailing sent to our lists is carefully reviewed before it is sent, and when we  rent our mailing lists, we monitor them to ensure they are used only for the approved  purpose. Because of the difficulty inherent in tracking their use, we do not  provide email address lists to third parties except for service purposes such  as deployment or suppression, as described below.</p>

                <p class="style2">Ziff  Davis Enterprise also provides profile reports on specific companies, based on  subscriber-reported and publicly available data, to carefully screened  providers of quality goods and services. These include contact information for  the company and its key personnel.</p>

                <h6 class="style5" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Email and Postal Mail Deployment, Data Analysis and Other  Data Services</strong></h6>

                <p class="style2" style="margin-top: 0;">We  provide customer lists and other information to third party companies who  provide specialized services, such as email message deployment, merge-purge  (identifying and removing duplicate addresses) of lists, postal mailing,  subscription fulfillment, customer service and telemarketing, research,  statistical analysis, and other data processing. These companies work on our  behalf and we do not provide our lists or other data to them for their own,  permanent, use.</p>

                <p class="style2">In  order to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we also may provide  lists of customers who have opted-out of email promotion for Ziff Davis Enterprise  products to other companies, so they can be suppressed from mailings those  companies send on Ziff Davis Enterprise's behalf. In addition, if you  unsubscribe from a mailing we send to our own list on behalf of a third party,  your removal instruction may also be supplied to the third party and added to  their own suppression file.</p>

                <h6 class="style5" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Ziff Davis Enterprise Magazines, Seminars, Events, Sites  and Other Publications and Services</strong></h6>

                <p class="style2" style="margin-top: 0;">As  a Ziff Davis Enterprise customer you can also expect to receive relevant email  and postal offers for Ziff Davis Enterprise publications, seminars, events, web  sites and other services. From time to time we are also able to secure and  offer to our customers specially-negotiated discounts and new products from  other leading companies. If you would prefer not to receive such mailings in  the future, you can change your preference via the links in the previous  section ("Mailing Lists").</p>

                <h6 class="style5" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Change of Ownership of Ziff Davis Enterprise Properties</strong></h6>

                <p class="style2" style="margin-top: 0;">The  mailing list(s) associated with Ziff Davis Enterprise properties may also be  subject to transfer to another company in the event of a change of ownership.  In this event, Ziff Davis Enterprise or the new owner of the affected  properties will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you and provide  the opportunity to remove your name from the associated mailing list(s).</p>

                <h6 class="style5"><strong><em>Anonymous Information We Collect</em></strong></h6>

                <h6 class="style5" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Cookies</strong></h6>

                <p class="style2" style="margin-top: 0;">As  you probably know, cookies are small pieces of information that many Web sites  store on your computer's hard drive when you visit them. They don't tell us who  you are unless you've specifically given us personally identifiable information.  Cookies stored on your hard drive by a Ziff Davis Enterprise site are not  accessible to other sites.</p>

                <p class="style2">Like  many other web sites, Ziff Davis Enterprise sites use cookies to improve your  experience with our online content. For example, we may use a cookie to  identify members so they don't have to re-enter a user id and password when  they wish to download a utility or post to a discussion. As another example,  cookies can be used to control the number of times you see advertisements, like  pop-ups. By allowing us to better understand how users interact with the site  over time, cookies also help us improve your experience and deliver more  relevant content to you. Cookies may be created directly by our sites for these  purposes, or by third-party companies operating on our behalf. However, our  cookies do not contain any information that is, in itself, personally  identifying. Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We  do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. You need not have  cookies turned on to visit our sites, though cookies may be required in order  for you to participate in certain areas. If you choose to become a member of a  Ziff Davis Enterprise web site, you must have cookies enabled to access any  member related pages (i.e. Discussion Boards, Member Profile pages, Search for  a Member).</p>

                <p class="style2">Most  web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security  settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis.</p>

                <h6 class="style5" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Pixel Tags</strong></h6>

                <p class="style2" style="margin-top: 0;">Like  many web sites, Ziff Davis Enterprise may also use pixel tags, also known as  beacons, spotlight tags or web bugs, to improve our understanding of site  traffic, visitor behavior, and response to promotional campaigns, as a  supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response  measurement. Pixel tags are sometimes used in conjunction with small  Javascript-based applications, also for the purpose of traffic measurement. We  may also implement pixel tags provided by other companies, for the same  purpose. You can disable pixel tags by changing your browser settings to omit  images and disable Javascript; or there are commercial software packages  available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements.</p>

                <p class="style2"><strong><span class="style6">Online Ad Serving</span><br>

                </strong>Ziff  Davis Enterprise uses Doubleclick, a third-party advertising service company,  to serve advertisements when you visit our sites. This company may use  information (not including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone  number, or any other information you've provided us) about your visits to our  and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services  of interest to you. For this purpose, Doubleclick uses cookies and may use  pixel tags (also called clear gifs, spotlight tags and beacons) For more  information about Doubleclick's information collection practices, and to know  your choices about not having this information used by Doubleclick, <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/">click here</a>.</p>

                <p class="style2" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Several  companies provide email deployment services for our email messages. The  personally identifiable information, such as e-mail address, we provide to  these vendors for the purposes of e-mail deployment is only used by them for  that purpose and not for any other business activity. </p>

                <p class="style2" style="margin-top:0;">Some  of our advertisers use third-party companies to serve their advertisements on  our sites and, in some cases, in our HTML-formatted newsletters. Often, these  third-party advertising companies employ cookie and pixel tag technologies to  measure the effectiveness of Web and e-mail advertisements. We do not give any  personally identifiable information to them as part of this relationship. Use  of their tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies. For more  information about the privacy policies of the third-party advertising providers  including information on how to opt out of their tracking methods, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">click here</a>.</p>

                <h6 class="style5" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Ziff Davis Enterprise eSeminars</strong></h6>

                <p class="style2" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ziff  Davis Enterprise eSeminars produces and hosts sponsored webcasts and online  trade shows for a variety of companies (Sponsors). All data collected during  the registration for such events will be shared with those Sponsors. This data  is governed by the individual Sponsor's privacy policy and may be used by the  Sponsor for follow-up purposes.
