        We try to run a lot of smaller sales and we can do that now because I can Windsor Circle’s Segment Builder to determine anyone who’s purchased fabric within a specific category that would be interested in this sale. Or I can look at people who purchased a subset of tools that would be interested in related supplies and resources. These were just things that we could never do in the past.
