									<b>Microsoft.com Statement of Privacy</b><br>
									<i>This document was last updated February 23, 2001.</i><br>
									<br>
									At Microsoft, we are committed to protecting your privacy and to developing 
									technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience. You 
									can travel through most of our site without giving us any information about 
									yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide services that you 
									request, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use in 
									those situations. Please read the complete Microsoft.com privacy statement.
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Collecting your Personal Information</b><br>
									We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you 
									(personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information 
									is requested when you are asked to register before entering a contest, ordering 
									e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access premium site, or when purchasing 
									and registering Microsoft products. Personal information collected by 
									Microsoft.com often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or 
									location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service 
									you requested.
									<br>
									<br>
									For example: If you choose to make a purchase in the <a href="http://shop.Microsoft.com">
										Shop area</a> of the Web site, we will request personal information such 
									as: name, address, telephone number, credit card number and shipping 
									information.
									<br>
									<br>
									When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your 
									purchase electronically. When you do, we keep this registration information on 
									file with any information you've already given us on previous visits to our Web 
									site. This is considered your personal profile.
									<br>
									<br>
									Microsoft.com uses Microsoft Passport as its registration service. Passport 
									allows you to access your personal information at Microsoft, plus shop securely 
									at many other participating <a href="http://www.passport.com/Directory/Default.asp?PPDir=C&amp;PPlcid=1033">
										Passport Web sites</a>, by signing in with your e-mail address and a 
									password. When you register for a Passport, your profile is created.
									<br>
									<br>
									If you ever want to review or update your profile, simply visit the <a href="http://www.Microsoft.com/isapi/goregwiz.asp?target=/regsys/logon.asp?fu=/regsys/pic.asp&amp;cu=/regsys/pic.asp">
										Profile Center</a> and edit your personal information. We'll ask you to 
									disclose your Microsoft Passport (e-mail address and password) so that only you 
									can access your profile.
									<br>
									<br>
									The Passport service assigns a personal identification number and sends it to 
									your computer in the form of a small text file, called a "cookie." The use of 
									this cookie allows you to visit other participating Passport Web sites without 
									having to sign in to each Web site. To learn more about the Passport service 
									and how Passport uses and protects your personal information, please read the <a href="http://www.passport.com/Consumer/PrivacyPolicy.asp?PPlcid=1033">
										Passport Privacy Statement</a>.
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Use of your Personal Information</b><br>
									We use your personal information for four primary purposes:
									<ul>
										<li>
										To make the site easier for you to use by not making you enter your personal 
										information more than once.
										</li><li>
										To help you quickly find software, services or information on Microsoft.com.
										</li><li>
										To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you.
										</li><li>
											To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other 
											new services from Microsoft.</li>
									</ul>
									We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, 
									including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer 
									questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event 
									registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to 
									deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for 
									any other purpose.
									<br>
									<br>
									Microsoft will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if 
									required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is 
									necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process 
									served on Microsoft or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property 
									of Microsoft and its family of Web sites, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances 
									to protect the personal safety of users of Microsoft, its Web sites, or the 
									public.
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Control of your Personal Information</b><br>
									When you register, or otherwise give us personal information, Microsoft.com 
									will not share that information with third parties without your permission, 
									other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for 
									the purposes stated above.
									<br>
									<br>
									Registering also allows you to tell us how or whether you want Microsoft.com to 
									communicate with you. After registering, go to the <a href="http://www.Microsoft.com/isapi/goregwiz.asp?target=/regsys/logon.asp?fu=/regsys/pic.asp&amp;cu=/regsys/pic.asp">
										Profile Center</a> and establish your preferences in the Contact Options 
									sections. There, you can decide what information you want to receive and how 
									you want to receive it. Or you can tell us not to contact you.
									<br>
									<br>
									Microsoft.com occasionally allows other companies to offer our registered 
									customers information about their products and services, using postal mail 
									only. If you do not want to receive these offers, you should uncheck the box in 
									the Contact Options section in the <a href="http://www.Microsoft.com/isapi/goregwiz.asp?target=/regsys/logon.asp?fu=/regsys/pic.asp&amp;cu=/regsys/pic.asp">
										Profile Center</a> stating, "Microsoft partners can send me postal mail 
									about their services or products."
									<br>
									<br>
									Microsoft.com may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service 
									issues related to a product or service you requested. You will not be able to 
									choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered an essential 
									part of the service you have chosen.
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Access to your Personal Information</b><br>
									We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is 
									correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time at 
									the <a href="http://www.Microsoft.com/isapi/goregwiz.asp?target=/regsys/logon.asp?fu=/regsys/pic.asp&amp;cu=/regsys/pic.asp">
										Profile Center</a>. You can:
									<ul>
										<li>
										View and edit personal information you have already given us.
										</li><li>
										Tell us whether you want Microsoft.com to send you marketing information.
										</li><li>
										Choose whether you want third parties to send you their offers by postal mail.
										</li><li>
											Subscribe or cancel subscriptions to newsletters about our services and 
											products.</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Security of your Personal Information</b><br>
									Microsoft.com strictly protects the security of your personal information and 
									honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from 
									loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
									<br>
									<br>
									Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your 
									permission, except under conditions explained above. Inside the company, data 
									is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. Your information 
									may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where 
									Microsoft, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located.
									<br>
									<br>
									You also have a significant role in protecting your information. No one can see 
									or edit your personal information without knowing your Passport and password, 
									so do not share these with others.
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Protection of Children's Personal Information</b><br>
									The Microsoft.com site does not publish content that is targeted to children. 
									However, if you are concerned about your children providing Microsoft any 
									personal information without your consent, Microsoft offers a Kids Passport 
									account. It allows parents to give parental consent for the collection, use and 
									sharing of children's (ages 12 and under) personal information online. To learn 
									more about this service, visit Kids Passport on <a href="http://www.passport.com">www.passport.com.</a>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
									To ensure we are publishing content customers need and want, Microsoft.com 
									collects aggregated site-visitation statistics using cookies. We do not track 
									individuals' use of the site.
									<br>
									<br>
									When someone visits the site, a cookie is placed on the customer's machine (if 
									the customer accepts cookies) or is read if the customer has visited the site 
									previously.
									<br>
									<br>
									Web beacons, also known as clear gif technology, or action tags, assist in 
									delivering the cookie. This technology tells us how many visitors clicked on 
									key elements (such as links or graphics) on a Microsoft.com Web page. We do not 
									use this technology to access your personally identifiable information on 
									Microsoft.com; it is a tool we use to compile aggregated statistics about 
									Microsoft.com Web site usage. We do not share tracking information outside of 
									Microsoft, and do not allow other companies to place clear gifs on our sites.
									<br>
									<br>
									Microsoft also uses cookies in connection with the use of your Passport account 
									on the Microsoft.com Web site as explained above.
									<br>
									<br>
									If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from the Microsoft.com 
									Web site, you will be able to view the text on the screens, however you will 
									not experience a personalized visit nor will you be able to subscribe to the 
									service offerings on the site.

									<b>TRUSTe Certification</b><br>
									Microsoft is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an 
									independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build trust and 
									confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. 
									Because Microsoft.com wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, we 
									have agreed to publish our information practices and have our privacy practices 
									reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, 
									Microsoft.com has agreed to disclose to you:
