We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as providing customer support or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service.  They are required to maintain the confidentiality of that information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

</p><p><a name="list6"></a><span class="month" style="COLOR:#000000">The Use of Third Party Ad Networks</span><br>
The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on WindowsMedia.com websites are displayed by MSN. Because of this, MSN may also place cookies on your computer. In addition, WindowsMedia.com and MSN allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on WindowsMedia.com websites. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. WindowsMedia.com does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks. 
<br>MSN maintains relationships with a number of the third-party ad networks currently operating such as: 24/7 Real Media; AdForce; AdKnowledge; AppNet/admaximize/i33; Avenue A; BlueStreak.com; CFM&amp;Z; Click Here; DoubleClick; Flycast; Interad Network; MatchLogic; Mediaplex; Sabela Media; The Thinking Media; and Vita Bella.
