WINHUNDRED.COM IS UNWILLING TO OFFER YOU THE SERVICE. YOU SHOULD LEAVE THE SITE. 
This Privacy Policy covers WinHundred LLC.’s treatment of personally identifiable 
information that WinHundred LLC. collects when you are on web sites operated by WinHundred LLC. 
and when you use WinHundred LLC.’s services. It is important that 
visitors are fully informed about the use of their personal information. For

of our Website, where guests provide content submissions and suggestions or 
participate in interactive online activities (i.e., by way of responding to 
questions and surveys, community listings, ratings, searches and comparison 
searches, bidding, purchasing, chat, games, or bulletin boards, etc.). The 
personal profile information you submit to WinHundred LLC. remains your property,

These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and 
applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and 
validation. In addition, WinHundred LLC. reserves the right to release current or 
past member information in the event WinHundred LLC. believes that the membership 
is being or has been used in violation of the Rules or to commit unlawful acts, 
if the information is subpoenaed, if WinHundred LLC. is sold or acquired, or when 
WinHundred LLC. deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these terms, 
you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any third 
party when WinHundred LLC. in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to 
be appropriate.</span></p>
