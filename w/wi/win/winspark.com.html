<p>This Privacy Policy outlines our practices with respect to collecting, using and disclosing the Private Information we gather through your use of our services and website, and relays the rights of individuals in relation to the personal data we hold.</p>
<p>The Privacy Policy is a part of our Terms of Service and is incorporated therein by reference. It is likewise an integral part of Winspark User Agreement. Accordingly, when you access or use the Winspark website, you automatically agree to our collection, use, and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We collect your information in order to:</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Comply with our regulatory duties, obligations and responsibilities.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Conform to legal requirements or comply with legal processes under any valid and applicable legislation and/or competent authority (meaning any authority having any governmental, juridical or regulatory jurisdiction over us).</li>
<li>For the purpose of reporting&nbsp; potential or suspected crime, including money laundering or&nbsp; fraud.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;">If you do not agree, or are not comfortable with any part of this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Winspark website and services.</p>
<p>According to the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Winspark commits to taking the following customer’s rights into consideration:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Breach Notification</strong></span></p>
<p>Where a data breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the Company is obliged to inform all customers within 72 hours of first having become aware of such a breach.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Right to Access</strong></span></p>
<p>Winspark’s clients have the right to know whether or not personal data is being processed, where, and for what purpose. For more detailed information, customers can check the following sections of the privacy Policy (below):&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;- The type of information we collect&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>&nbsp;- How we collect information?</strong><br><strong>&nbsp;- How we use the information we collect&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>&nbsp;- With whom we share the information</strong><br><strong>&nbsp;- Retention of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Upon request, we will provide our customers with a copy of the collected personal data in an electronic format.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Right to be Forgotten&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Winspark’s clients have the right to request their personal data to be erased and cease the further dissemination of their data by the Company or any third parties. It should also be taken into consideration that this right requires the Company to compare the individual’s rights to the “public interest in the availability of the data” when regarding such requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Data Portability&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Winspark’s customers have the right to request their previously provided personal data. Data portability allows customers to use this data with other operators as well.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The type of information we collect&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>We collect two types of information from our users:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.

User’s personal information includes, Inter alia, User’s name, address, phone number, e-mail address, credit card number and financial information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we combine Personal Information with Non-Personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How we collect information&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>We collect all the Account Information that you provide us with during the Account creation process and your personal information when you register to become a member of our site or voluntarily provide when you use the site / communicate with us. In order to offer the best possible service and to minimise any risk of unfairness, we keep records of your gaming history and financial transactions history. We also collect information when certain changes in a customer’s account are applied upon a customer’s wish, such as changes in email address, registration of a new payment method, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cookies&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Transfer of information&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Winspark is SSL-Secured. When your (Personal and Non-Personal) Information passes from your computer to our server, we ensure that your personal information and all other sensitive data is transferred securely over the internet and kept strictly confidential, augmented by the most recently updated firewall technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since we operate globally, it may be necessary to transfer your Personal Information to countries outside the European Union.

In such instances, we will take steps to ensure that a similar level of protection is given to your Personal Information. Note that by using our site and our services, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Information to countries outside the European Union.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Note, however, we may be required to continue to retain records containing your information for legitimate business, regulatory, compliance and/or legal purposes. We may also rectify, replenish, or remove incomplete or inaccurate information at any time and at our own discretion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Winnings</strong></span></p>
<p>We believe that your good fortune is ultimately your own business. We therefore keep all our members' winnings and withdrawals strictly confidential and private.
