<a id="privacy-statement"></a><h3>Privacy Statement (Personal Information)</h3>


<p>
<b>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE:</b>
Our primary goals in collecting and using information are to provide and improve the service, to administer and assist you in administering your Account on the service, and to provide you with a better experience with the service. We store and process information in the United States. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, we transfer your information to the United States and processes it there, which is required for the normal operation of the service.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Personal information</strong> is information that specifically identifies an individual, including, but not limited to, an individual's name, email, credit card or other billing information and billing address (for the purposes of fulfilling a purchase order and licensing). Personal information does not include information that has been irreversibly anonymized or aggregated so that it can no longer enable us, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify you.</li>
	<li><strong>Non-personal information</strong> is information that is not, on its own, personal information, such as an individual's IP, zip/postal code, but that may be considered part of an individual's personal information if combined with other identifiers in a way that enables identification of an individual. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<a id="personal-information"></a>
<u>What Personal Information We Collect</u><br>
Depending on the services you use, we collect different kinds of personal information from or about you. In addition, we create a unique user ID to track your use of our services. This unique user ID is stored in connection with your information.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Information you provide</strong> - We collect information in any form you willingly enter data into. Such as your name and email during account registration. Any contact information you provide when asking us support questions. Signing up to our newsletter, or participating in public discussions and writing reviews.</li>

	<li><strong>Information about payments</strong> - We collect billing information in connection with your transactions (such as, but not limited to, donations or the purchase of products) through the service. Paying with PayPal, we also collect account ids and verification data.</li>

	<li><strong>Information about use of our services</strong> - When you visit our websites, we may collect general information about the type of device you use, your IP address, operating system, and the type of Internet browser being used. When you launch any of our applications, we collect information regarding your device type, operating system and version, carrier provider, IP address, whether you are using a point package, the game version, and unique device ID. We may gather some of this information automatically. Where available, our services may use GEO Location, your IP address, and other technologies to determine an approximate location to allow us to improve our products and services.</li>

	<li><strong>Information from third parties</strong> - Some 3rd party services we use, may send us some other personal information you provided during use of their websites and services. Such as any information you provide on the "Store Support" website (managed by desk.com).</li>

	<li><strong>Information from Facebook connect</strong> - If you use one of our applications and connect to your Facebook account within such application, you will be providing us with basic account information i.e., user ID, name, email, gender, birthday, profile picture URL. In addition, we will cache data we receive from the Facebook APIs to improve our user experience. </li>
</ul>

<a id="how-we-use-it"></a>

<li><strong>Purchase licensing</strong> - Some information may be used in the fulfillment process for game purchases that return a license code. Some licensing is handled through third parties, and every effort is made to provide the bare minimum actual personal information. Most data is anonymized for the licensing transactions on your behalf to keep your personal information private.</li>

<li><strong>Promoting safety and security</strong> - We use personal information to help verify accounts and user activity, as well as to maintain security, such as by monitoring fraud and investigating suspicious or potentially illegal activity or violations of our terms or policies.

Like many websites (almost all), we use "cookie" technology to hold a session with you, manage your account access and to maintain a few site preferences (including cookie opt-outs). We do not use cookies to <i>collect</i> personal information about you, but rather know it is you who has returned to us and how we should proceed to give you a rewarding experience. We reference cookies we issue with personal information that you provided to us (such as your account sign in session and preferences). This allows a fairly consistent experience. We may use cookies to improve the service and our other products and services.
