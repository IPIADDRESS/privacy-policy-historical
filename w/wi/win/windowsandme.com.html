<h5>Windows and Me Privacy Statement</h5>
                        <i>(last updated:29th July 2008)</i> 
                        <p>Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy. 
                          This privacy statement applies to the data collected 
                          by Microsoft through the Windows and Me site (the “Site”); 
                          it does not apply to data collected through other online 
                          or offline Microsoft sites, products or services. </p>
<h5>Collection of Your Personal Information</h5>
                        <p>We will ask you when we need information that personally 
                          identifies you or allows us to contact you. The personal 
                          information we collect may include name, e-mail address, 
                          password of site, phone, postal address, description 
                          of oneself, date of birth, gender, marital status, date 
                          of marriage (if you are married) number of children 
                          (if you are a parent) and photograph (if you choose 
                          to uploaded your picture)To sign in to the Site, you 
                          will be asked to enter an e-mail address and password, 
                          which we refer to as your Windows Live™ ID or 
                          your Microsoft Passport Network credentials. After you 
                          create your Windows Live ID, you can use the same credentials 
                          to sign into many different Microsoft sites and services, 
                          as well as those of select Microsoft partners, that 
                          display the Windows Live ID or Microsoft Passport Network 
                          logos. By signing in on one Microsoft site or service, 
                          you may be automatically signed in when you visit other 
                          Microsoft sites and services. To learn more about how 
                          your credential information is used when you sign into 
                          participating sites, please read the Microsoft Online 
                          Privacy Statement at <a href="http://privacy.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">http://privacy.microsoft.com/</a>.</p>
                        <p>We may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, 
                          the links you click and other actions taken in connection 
                          with the Site. We also collect certain standard information 
                          that your browser sends to every website you visit, 
                          such as your IP address, browser type and language, 
                          access times and referring Web site addresses. </p>
<h5>Use of Your Personal Information</h5>
                        <p>The personal information collected on this Site will 
                          be used to operate the Site and to provide the service(s) 
                          or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or 
                          authorized. </p>
                        <p>In support of these uses, Microsoft may use personal 
                          information to provide you with more effective customer 
                          service, to improve the Site and any related Microsoft 
                          products or services, and to make the Site easier to 
                          use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter 
                          the same information or by customizing the Site to your 
                          particular preference or interests. </p>
                        <p>We may use your personal information to provide you with important information 
                          about the product or service that you are using, including 
                          critical updates and notifications. Additionally, with 
                          your permission, we may send you information about other 
                          Microsoft products and services, and/or share information 
                          with Microsoft partners so they may send you information 
                          about their products and services.</p>
                        <p>Microsoft occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on 
                          our behalf, such as Web site hosting, packaging, mailing 
                          and delivering prizes, answering customer questions 
                          about products and services, and sending information 
                          about our products, special offers, and other new services. 
                          We will only provide those companies the personal information 
                          they need to deliver the service. They are required 
                          to maintain the confidentiality of the information and 
                          are prohibited from using that information for any other 
                          purpose. </p>
                        <p>Microsoft may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or 
                          in the good faith belief that such action is necessary 
                          to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with 
                          legal process served on Microsoft or the Site; (b) protect 
                          and defend the rights or property of Microsoft and our 
                          family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances 
                          to protect the personal safety of users of Microsoft 
                          products or members of the public. </p>
                        <p>Personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the 
                          United States or any other country in which Microsoft 
                          or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, 
                          and by using the Site, you consent to any such transfer 
                          of information outside of your country. Microsoft abides 
                          by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. 
                          Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, 
                          and retention of data from the European Union. </p>

                        <p>Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide 
                          on the Site will not be shared outside of Microsoft 
                          and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without 
                          your permission.</p>
 
                        <p>Please be aware that this privacy statement and any choices you make on the 
                          Site will not necessarily apply to personal information 
                          you may have provided to Microsoft in the context of 
                          other, separately operated, Microsoft products or services. 
                        </p>
<h5>Communication Preferences</h5>
                        <p>You can stop the delivery of future promotional e-mail from the site by following 
                          the specific instructions in the e-mail you receive.</p>
                        <p>You also have the option of proactively making choices about the receipt of 
                          promotional e-mail, telephone calls, and postal mail 
                          from the site by signing into the site and accessing 
                          the manage profile link. The profile page allows you 
                          to choose whether you wish to receive marketing communications 
                          from Windowsandme.com, and to subscribe or unsubscribe 
                          to our newsletters. </p>
                        <p>These choices do not apply to the display of online advertising. Nor do they 
                          apply to the receipt of mandatory service communications 
                          that are considered part of certain Microsoft services, 
                          which you may receive periodically unless you cancel 
                          the service.</p>
<h5>Access to Your Personal Information</h5>
                        <p>You can review and edit the personal information you provided at this Site 
                          by signing in to the site with your credentials (e-mail 
                          address and password) and clicking on manage profile. 
                        </p>
                        <p>You can alternatively update your profile information, 
                          change your password, view the unique ID associated 
                          with your credentials, or close certain accounts by 
                          visiting Windows Live <a href="https://accountservices.msn.com/" target="_blank">Account 
                          Services</a>. </p>
<h5>Security of Your Personal Information</h5>
                        <p>Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. 
                          We use a variety of security technologies and procedures 
                          to help protect your personal information from unauthorized 
                          access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the 
                          personal information you provide on computer servers 
                          with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. 
                          Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal information 
                          (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we 
                          protect it through the use of encryption, such as the 
                          Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. </p>
<h5>Use of Cookies </h5>
                        <p>We use cookies on this Site to ensure the integrity of the registration process 
                          and to personalize the Site. A cookie is a small text 
                          file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page 
                          server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver 
                          viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned 
                          to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the 
                          domain that issued the cookie to you. </p>
                        <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature 
                          to save you time. For example, if you personalize a 
                          web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps 
                          the site to recall your specific information on subsequent 
                          visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant 
                          content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you 
                          return to the web site, the information you previously 
                          provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the 
                          site's features that you customized. </p>
                        <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. 
                          Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but 
                          you can usually <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm" target="_blank">modify 
                          your browser setting</a> to decline cookies if you prefer. 
                          If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able 
                          to use interactive features of this or other web sites 
                          that depend on cookies. </p>

<h5>Use of Web Beacons</h5>
                        <p>Microsoft Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes 
                          called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to assist 
                          in delivering cookies on our sites and allow us to count 
                          users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded 
                          services. We may include Web beacons in promotional 
                          e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine 
                          whether messages have been opened and acted upon.</p>
                        <p>Microsoft may also employ Web beacons from third parties in order to help us 
                          compile aggregated statistics and determine the effectiveness 
                          of our promotional campaigns. We prohibit Web beacons 
                          on our sites from being used by third parties to collect 
                          or access your personal information.
</p><h5>Changes to this Privacy Statement</h5>
                        <p>We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also 
                          revise the "last updated" date at the top 
                          of the privacy statement. For material changes to this
