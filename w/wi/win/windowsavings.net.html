		<br>
		The selection of the partner usually depends on the partner desire to accept quote requests at the time the user submits the request, and on the type of the project. <br>

		Once our system selects a partner, we pass the information about the quote request to this partner automatically. The partner will carry out a matching process to determine the most suitable contractors for your project. The matching process depends on many factors including but not limited to the request quote project description determined by the user answers to our form various questions (e.g. install or repair windows). 
		<br>
		Your quote request usually will be matched to 1-4 contractors. In some cases, the partner will not be able to match your quote with any partner.
