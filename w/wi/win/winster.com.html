				Reloaded Games, Inc.   ("Winnie", "I", "we", "us", "our") believes in the Golden Rule: We respect your   right to privacy, and intend to treat your personal information as We would want   ours treated on your web site. This notice describes our Privacy Policy. <br>
				<br>
				By visiting Winster.com, you are accepting the practices described in   this Privacy Policy. <br>
				<br>
				<h4>What personal information do We gather about you? </h4>
				<strong>Information you   give us</strong>: We may receive and keep any information you enter on our web site   or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information,   but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our   offerings.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Information about you obtained from third parties</strong>: In   the course of our business, we may receive and keep information about you that   we receive from third parties. This could include information from our business   partners and/or vendors as to whether, when, and how you collect your prizes or   make other purchases from them, package shipping status and delivery   information, or other information that relates to or results from your   relationship with us. We may consult sources of information related to your   credit history or from credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect   fraud and to offer certain credit or financial services to you. <br>
				<br>
				<strong>Automatic information</strong>: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our web site. For example, like many web sites, we use "cookies". We love many kinds of cookies, but these cookies are small files that we store on your computer that permit us to remember things about you, such as who you are and when you last visited. We may also allow third parties, such as our advertising partners, to place cookies on your computer.  These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.  You can set most browsers to tell you when a new cookie is deposited, or to prevent cookies from being stored altogether. <br>
				<br>
				<strong>Email and other communications</strong>: When you   email, fax, phone, write, or otherwise contact us, we may keep a record of these   communications. <br>
				<br>
				Note that even though you change or delete your   information on our web site, or cancel your account, we may keep copies of your   information for our records or for backup. We may also retain certain credit and   credit card information, for use in future audits, investigating charge backs,   as required by merchant agreements or creditors, or for other legitimate   business purposes.<br>
				<br>
				<h4>Do we share what we know about you? </h4>
				In general, we only share   information about you with third parties when we need to in order to transact   business with you or on your behalf, when you have requested us or permitted us   to, when required by law, when we think it will benefit you (i.e. for your own   good), or occasionally, for our own profit. We may also share your personal   information with you, when we reasonably believe we are communicating with you. <br>
				<br>
				In the course of running our Games and operating our web site, there are   occasions when we may share information about you with other members and   players. We will tell you that we may do this when we collect, or you provide us   with, specific information such as your screen name and interests. <br>
				<br>
				We   send you email and other forms of communication for a variety of reasons, such   as to tell you about new games, features, and prizes, to tell you if you have   won, to confirm orders and charges, to deliver prizes and gift certificates, and   to respond to your customer service requests. Also, we may send offers to you on   behalf of other businesses. If you do not want to receive certain email or other   communications from us, send an email from the email account that you would like   to remove to <a href="mailto:unsub-int@winster.com?subject=UNSUBSCRIBE">unsub-int@winster.com</a> with "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the Subject field. <br>
				<br>
				We employ people, consultants,   and other companies to perform functions for us. This may from time to time   include order fulfillment, prize delivery, sending mail (postal and electronic),   analyzing data, marketing consulting, processing credit card payments, providing   customer service, and other business functions. These organizations and   individuals may have access to your personal information as needed to perform   their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Note specifically that   we may share information about you with business partners and vendors from whom   we source prizes, including gift certificates, and they may retain this   information for their records, add you to their customer records, and treat this   information in accordance with their own privacy policies which may differ from   ours. we may receive discounts, payments, or other forms of consideration in   return for sharing this information with them. <br>
				<br>
				As we grow our business,   we may sell or buy other businesses, subsidiaries, or business units. In such   transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business   assets but remains subject to the terms of any pre-existing Privacy Policy   (unless, of course, you give us permission to do otherwise). If our business (or   substantially all of its assets in one or more transactions) is acquired by or assigned to another party, your personal   information may be one of the assets transferred to that party. <br>
				<br>
				We also   like to obey the law, so we may release your personal information as appropriate   to comply with the law or in response to what we believe to be legitimate   requests from law enforcement agencies. If we suspect that you aren't playing   fair, have lied to us, are impersonating or pretending to be someone else, are   violating the law or our Terms &amp; Conditions of Use, are abusing our web site   or are infringing our rights (or those of some third party) in some way, we may   disclose your information to others in order to investigate our suspicions or   help them to stop you from behaving badly. This includes exchanging information   with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk   reduction, among other purposes. <br>
				<br>
				Other than the above, we will tell you   when we intend to share information about you with third parties, and you will   have an opportunity to tell us not to do it. <br>
				<br>
				Special message for   California Residents: Effective January 1, 2005, companies that collect   personally identifiable information from California residents and disclose such   information to third parties (including affiliated entities) for marketing   purposes must, in response to a request by a consumer, either (1) provide a list   detailing the categories of information shared and the entities to which such   information was provided or (2) provide a mechanism by which a consumer may   opt-out of having their information shared with third parties (SB 27). We have   elected the second option, and you may request that your information not be   shared with third parties by sending or hand delivering your request, including   your full name, email address and postal address to: Reloaded Games Inc., | 14252 Culver Drive, Suite A-355 | Irvine, California 92604.
				<h4>What do we do to protect your information? </h4>
				We are committed to handling   your trusted information with high standards of security. <br>
				<br>
				We use   scrambling (encryption) methods to protect precious information like credit card   numbers. In fact some things (like passwords) are so scrambled that nobody, not   even us, can unscramble it. <br>
				<br>
				We maintain physical, electronic and   procedural safeguards that protect your information. We restrict access to your   information to employees who need to know that information in order to help you. <br>
				<br>
				We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software when appropriate, which   scrambles your information like an egg when it is transmitted between your   computer and ours.<br>
				<br>
				We maintain information on a computer that is not   directly accessible from the internet. Instead, we keep it tucked away   discreetly behind our cozy little firewall.<br>
				<br>
				You can help! Anyone who has   or gains access to your account will be able to view your personal information,   so please be sure that you protect yourself by controlling access to your   computer(s), keeping your login and password information confidential, and   exercising care when using other people's or public computers. And watch out for   those sneaky kids around the house - they know more than you think! <br>
				<br>
				<h4>Kids! Gotta love 'em (but not here)! </h4>
				We love kids, but not on our web   site. As per our Terms &amp; Conditions of Use, no one under the age of 18 can   register on our web site or play our Games. <br>
				<br>
				<h4>Terms &amp; Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions </h4>
				When you visit   our web site, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy   Notice and our Terms &amp; Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages,   and application of the law of the state of California.   Please contact Customer Support if you have and questions or issues about these   policies. <br>
				<br>
				Our web site may contain links to other web sites, and we are   not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. <br>
				<br>
				We always strive to improve ourselves and our web site, and so our   Privacy Policy and Terms &amp; Conditions of Use may change from time to time   without notifying you. We recommend that you check our web site once in a while   to see if we have made any changes.
