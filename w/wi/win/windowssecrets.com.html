<h1>Our Ironclad Privacy Policy</h1>

<div class="t2">
All subscribers to the Windows Secrets Newsletter and visitors to the 
WindowsSecrets.com Web site are covered by our Ironclad Privacy Policy:
<ol>
<li>We will never sell, rent, or give away your address to any outside party, ever;</li>
<li>We will never send you any unrequested e-mail, besides newsletter updates; and</li>
<li>All unsubscribe requests are honored immediately, period.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="t2">
<b>What this Means</b>
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy applies solely to information we collect for the Windows 
Secrets Newsletter (the "Newsletter") and through the WindowsSecrets.com Web Site 
(the "Web Site"). For information on how we handle information collected by any 
other means (e.g., via customer information forms, etc.), please contact us at 
the addresses listed below.</div><br>

<div class="t2">
<b>1. We will never sell, rent, or give away your address to any outside party, ever.</b>
<br><br>
If you are a subscriber to the Newsletter, we collect your e-mail address. We 
then send each issue of the Newsletter to your e-mail address, or we send a 
notification to your e-mail address that the Newsletter is available at the Web 
Site, according to your preference, if you stated one. When you set your 
preferences or upgrade to the paid version of the Newsletter, you may provide 
some additional personal information, including an alternate e-mail address and 
credit card information.
<br><br>
Visitors to the Web Site who send us an e-mail or who use the form on the 
<a href="http://WindowsSecrets.com/contact" class="t29">Contact Us</a> page may 
provide additional information, some of which may be personal information. For 
each visitor to the Web Site, we may collect the Internet Protocol address from 
which you accessed the Web Site, the contents of forms and queries, what items 
you clicked on each applicable Web page, information about the browser you 
are using, and other usage information. Some of this information is personal, 
and some of it is not.
<br><br>
Your personal information will never be used except to make the Newsletter 
available to you if you are a subscriber, or to contact you if there is a 
question about your Newsletter subscription or to respond to a query about the 
Newsletter or the Web Site. We will never sell, rent, or give away your personal 
information to any outside party, ever. We will share your address and other 
personal information only with persons or companies who help us prepare and 
distribute the Newsletter and maintain the Web Site, but we will not give them 
the right to contact you on their own behalf or on behalf of anyone else. In 
addition, we may disclose your personal information to a person or company that 
subsequently owns or maintains the Newsletter or the Web Site, but only if that 
person or company agrees to comply with the provisions of this Privacy Policy with 
respect to the use of your information.
<br><br>
When you visit a page at the Web Site to sign up for a subscription to the 
Newsletter, view an issue of the Newsletter, or to use some of the other 
resources on the Web Site, your browser may write a "cookie" file to your computer. 
A "cookie" is a tiny, plain-text file that counts the number of unique visitors 
and what Web sites they came from. It does not contain any personal information. 
You can stop your browser from using cookies by changing your settings, but 
there is no privacy benefit from doing so as far as our Web Site is concerned.</div><br>  

<div class="t2">
<b>2. We will never send you any unrequested e-mail, besides newsletter updates.</b>
<br><br>

In addition to the other e-mails discussed above in this Privacy Policy, we may 
send you e-mail updates about your subscription to the Newsletter or your use of 
the Web Site. We will never send you any other unrequested or unrelated e-mail.</div><br>

<div class="t2">
<b>3. All unsubscribe requests are honored immediately, period.</b>
<br><br>
If you choose to unsubscribe, we will miss you, but we will honor your request. 
Our computer systems usually process unsubscribe requests within a few moments 
of receiving the request. If our computer systems are temporarily offline, we 
will take all reasonable steps to get them working again. Note that we can only 
honor unsubscribe requests that provide all of the information we need to unsubscribe 
you, such as the specific e-mail address that you use for your subscription. For 
example, if you provide us with a name, but not a complete e-mail address, then 
we cannot unsubscribe you from the Newsletter or the Site as there may be many 
different subscribers with similar-sounding names.</div><br>

<div class="t2">
<b>No Information from Children</b>
<br><br>
We do not knowingly solicit or collect information from any individuals under 
the age of 13, nor do we provide any of our products or services to individuals 
under the age of 13. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected any 
such information, or provided any such products or services, please contact us 
immediately so that we may delete the information.</div><br>

<div class="t2">
<b>How to Access or Correct Your Information</b>
<br><br>
You can access your personally identifiable information that we have collected 
through the Web Site and that we still maintain by contacting us as described 
below. You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information 
by sending us a request that credibly shows that our records are incorrect, 
although we may refuse your requests in our sole discretion. To protect your 
privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity 
before granting access to your personally identifiable information or permitting 
you to make corrections.</div><br>

<div class="t2">
<b>Changes to the Privacy Policy</b>
<br><br>
We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in our 
discretion. If we modify this Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy 
Policy on the Web Site, and the revisedPrivacy Policy will take effect 30 days after posting. 
We will attempt to notify you of the posting through the e-mail address you 
provided. It is your responsibility to read e-mail messages from us and to 
periodically review this Privacy Policy page.</div><br>

<div class="t2">
<b>How to Contact Us</b>
<br><br>
We encourage you to contact us if you have any questions or concerns about the 
use of your information. Please use the form on the 
<a href="http://WindowsSecrets.com/contact" class="t29">Contact Us</a> page, or 
send postal mail to WindowsSecrets.com, 300 Queen Anne Ave. N. #456, Seattle, WA
