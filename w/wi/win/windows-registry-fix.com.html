			<p>This FIXIO Privacy Policy may occasionally change. Any Policy changes will be posted on this site (together with sites published by <strong>FIXIO</strong>, the "Site"). Each version of this policy will be denoted at the top of this page by its effective date.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We, at <strong>FIXIO</strong>, respect your right to privacy and we are committed to protecting it. This statement discloses the information that we gather and track, how we use the information, and with whom we share this same information.</p>
