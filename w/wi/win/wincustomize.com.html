      </h4>
      <p>
         <font face="Verdana" size="2">Beginning in 2005, some Stardock products require activation
            over the Internet to use their enhanced versions. Depending on if your order was
            directly through Stardock or through a third-party, we may ask for your first name,
            last name, email address, and the serial number/activation code for the product
            you have purchased. </font>
      </p>
      <p>
         <font face="Verdana" size="2">Your IP address and number of activation attempts will
            also be logged. There are reasonable limits on how often you can activate a given
            product to help deter piracy, but for most users, this limit will not be reached.
            If you have difficulties, please contact support@stardock.com.</font></p>
