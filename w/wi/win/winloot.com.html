                        Globalizer, LLC. and Winloot.com (collectively "Winloot®,"
                        "we", "our" or "us") are committed to protecting
                        your privacy. This Winloot® Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") applies
                        to the Winloot.com website (the "Site") and governs data collection
                        and usage including Winloot® Site and email services (the "Program").
                        This Privacy Policy is effective: (a) when you access the Site; (b) when you
                        register as a Winloot® member ("Member"); and (c) otherwise, with
                        respect to certain changes hereto, on the date noted above for all existing
                        Members.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We firmly believe that both our Members and our clients
                        benefit because we market only to people who have given us express permission
                        to do so.

                    <p>
                        While the word "privacy" may mean different things
                        to different people, we believe that once you understand how we use your

                        Winloot® collects both personal and non-personal information
                        using the methods listed below. Our primary purpose in collecting such
                        information is to provide you with a personalized experience by displaying
                        content and delivering offers that are likely to be of interest to you
                        according to your preferences.

                    </strong>

                    <p>
                        When you sign in to the Site, the server automatically
                        recognizes you by your “cookies,” which are small text files that are placed on
                        your computer by the Site upon arrival. The cookies that we use are
                        “analytical” in nature, in that they act as unique identifiers and are linked
                        to your personal information, allowing us to access your personal information
                        and personalize the Site and Program to your specified interests. The cookies
                        also allow us to keep track of your activity on the Site, properly credit
                        entries to your account and help ensure that only you can access your account.
                        The information collected by the cookies may be added to your personal profile
                        and used to deliver offers and advertisements that are relevant to your
                        interests.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Program makes active use of third-party companies to
                        display advertisements on the Site or in Winloot® email. Many of Winloot’s®
                        third-party advertisers, shopping affiliates and merchants utilize “analytical”
                        cookies, similar to Winloot’s® described above, to identify you as a Member of
                        Winloot®. This enables the cookies to report transactions back to us so we are
                        able to properly credit activity generated on the Site. Third-party cookies are
                        also used to count unique page views, email responses and future transaction
                        activity corresponding to specific offers. For these reasons, full
                        participation in the Program is dependent upon you setting your browser
                        configuration to accept third-party cookies.

                    <p>
                        Additionally, we and our third-party advertisers use cookies
                        and clear pixel GIFs (also referred to as "web beacons") to measure
                        page views on the Site, advertiser websites, and email responses. These devices
                        allow us to identify unique visitors to the Site, Member visits to advertiser
                        websites, and act as a counter for ongoing monitoring of Site, email and
                        corresponding future transaction activity related to a specific offer for both
                        Winloot® and its advertisers. These commonly used cookies collect absolutely no
                        personal information and are only used to enhance the Program and make it more
                        relevant to your personal interests. Winloot® and its third-party ad networks
                        may also place “persistent” cookies on your computer, which recognize your
                        computer each time you receive an online advertisement. In this way,
                        information is compiled about where you, or others who are using your computer,
                        saw the advertisement and to determine which ads are clicked on. This
                        information allows targeted advertisements to be sent that will be of interest
                        to you. Winloot® does not have access to or control over the cookies that may
                        be placed by third-parties on your computer, and has no control over these parties'
                        privacy policies or information collection practices. For more information
                        regarding our practices related to third-party ad servers, please see Section

                        details, which may include the items and quantities purchased, purchase price,
                        date and time of purchase. This information is used to credit your account
                        balance in the event of returns and exchanges. This information is used by the
                        Member Services department while assisting you in resolving account inquiries.
                        We may also use your transaction information to provide you more timely
                        relevant offers, products and services.

                        members to give us basic contact information (such as your first name, last
                        name, e-mail address and mobile telephone number) and demographic information

                        requests may change from time to time. Although additional demographic
                        information may be requested at the time of registration, only information

                        you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you

                        or process any applicable payment, such as a credit card or debit card number
                        and expiration date. We may use the information you provide us to bill you for
                        products and services you request, or to notify you of additional products and
                        services we may offer. When you sign up for a paid or other enhanced product or
                        service on the Site, you are consenting to our delivery of this information to
                        our service providers, which may include banks and credit card companies that

                        When we do share data with our advertisers it is in aggregate form and is
                        designed to ensure you are not identified personally. If you purchase a product

                        identifiable information, you are also consenting to our delivery of this
                        information to that party. The offer will notify you if any financial or
                        personally identifiable information will be shared. Such third party will be
                        authorized to use this information in keeping with our contractual relationship
                        with them and in accordance with their own privacy policy and information
                        practices. We do not control these third parties and you agree that Winloot® is
                        not liable for their acts or any failure to act on their part.

                    <p>
                        Winloot® employs a strict policy against sending unsolicited
                        email. Because email is an integral part of the Program, you automatically sign
                        up to receive email from Winloot® including Winloot® offers, as well as third
                        party offers, that Winloot® thinks may be of interest to you. If you later
                        decide you wish to cease participation in this portion of the Program, you may
                        do so at any time by clicking on the opt-out links contained within each
                        Winloot® email or by sending an email to: <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@winloot.com">unsubscribe@winloot.com</a>. In addition, Winloot® employs a strict policy
                        against sending unsolicited SMS text messages. Because SMS text messages can be
                        an integral part of the Program, subject to obtaining your “prior express
                        written consent” as set forth in Section 6 above, Winloot® may contact you with
                        periodic SMS text messages related to the Program and other Winloot® products
                        and/or services. If you decide you wish to cease participation in this portion
                        of the Program, you may do so at any time by replying with the word “STOP” in
                        response to one of the SMS text messages that you receive from Winloot®, or sending
                        an email to: unsubscribe@winloot.com.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Please note that opting not to receive email does not exempt
                        you from receiving administrative emails that include, but are not limited to,
                        notices about vital Program and membership status changes, Privacy Policy and
                        Terms of Service updates and purchase and redemption confirmation emails
                        (collectively, “Winloot® Related Email”).

                        Our Member Services Department may contact you in response
                        to your inquiries, to provide services at your request and to manage your
                        account. We will communicate with you by email, telephone or fax in accordance
                        with your wishes (collectively, “Winloot® Administrative Contact”).

                        To opt-out of receiving Winloot® Related Email and Winloot®
                        Administrative Contact from Winloot®, you must cease membership, use of the
                        Program and submitting inquiries to Winloot®, as applicable.

                    <p>8. Winloot® Advertisers and Third Party Websites </p>

                    <p>
                        The Winloot® Site and emails contain links to various other
                        websites that are not owned by us. While we make reasonable efforts to ensure
                        that our advertisers post clear and complete privacy policies and observe
                        appropriate data practices, each of these websites has a privacy policy that
                        may differ from that of Winloot®. The privacy practices of other websites and
                        companies are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Please be aware that we are
                        not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage
                        you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of
                        each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Except as specifically set forth below, it is our policy not
                        to provide your personally identifiable information to our advertisers unless
                        you make the choice to share it with them. We occasionally pass personally
                        identifiable information (other than sensitive financial information) via a
                        secure interface to certain of our advertisers for the purpose of making it
                        easier for you to sign up for their offers. However, this information is only
                        to be used by the advertiser if you agree to submit the information to the
                        advertiser for the purposes of completing an offer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We occasionally use third parties to provide limited
                        services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of
                        mailings, providing customer support, processing transactions or performing
                        statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide these third parties
                        the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to
                        maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using
                        that information for any other purpose.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the event that we were unable to capture your transaction
                        detail, we may need to validate your transaction with an advertiser or merchant
                        partner. The validation information shared is used solely for this purpose and
                        may include your first name, last name, email address, mailing address or date
                        of birth. We will require that these third parties comply with the information
                        practices set forth in this Privacy Policy and that the information not be
                        shared or used for any other purpose.
                    </p>

                    <p>9. Testimonials </p>

                    <p>
                        Our users may submit testimonials about Winloot® on our
                        Site. In such cases, it is the user's choice as to whether their personally identifiable
                        information is posted along with the testimonial. In addition, Winloot® has
                        forums available to its users that allow them to post opinions or testimonials
                        about third-party products and services. You should be aware that any
                        personally identifiable information that you submit through these forums can be
                        read, collected or used by other users of these forums, which they could then
                        use to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally
                        identifiable information that you choose to submit in these forums.
                    </p>

                    <p>10. Refer-a-Friend </p>

                    <p>
                        If you elect to use any of our referral services for
                        informing friends about our Site, you will be asked to provide your friends'
                        names and e-mail addresses. You may enter this information manually, or you can
                        also choose to import your contacts from your email address book, in which case
                        you will be asked to provide us with your email address and password, which
                        will be used solely for the purpose of importing your contacts to our referral
                        service. We will then automatically send your friends a one-time e-mail, plus a
                        reminder email (both of which may include your name and email address) inviting
                        them to visit our Site. We ask for this information for the sole purpose of
                        sending these emails and tracking the success of our referral program.
                    </p>

                    <p>11. Deleting, Modifying and/or Updating Your Information </p>

                    <p>
                        At your request, we will inform you of what personal
                        information we have on file for you. In addition, at your request, we will
                        remove, update and/or modify the personal information that you have provided to
                        us, or that we have collected. You may do so by contacting us by clicking here;
                        provided, however, that we ask individuals to identify themselves and the
                        information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing
                        such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably
                        repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize
                        the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests
                        concerning information residing on backup tapes).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Please be advised that, after you delete your personal
                        information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted
                        from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems. In addition, this
                        deletion will not change or delete personal information which may have already
                        been shared with third parties, all as provided in this Privacy Policy. You
                        will need to contact the third parties that contact you directly to change your
                        preferences regarding their use of your personal information.
                    </p>

                    <p>12. Data Verification and Supplementation </p>

                    <p>
                        Data verification involves the use of third-party data
                        processing services to standardize and clean your provided enrollment
                        information so that it is easily identified and accessed in our database. Data
                        supplementation involves appending any publicly available information about you
                        to your personal profile.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In order to provide you with the most rewarding experience,
                        we might send your information to data processors so that they can clean your
                        address and standardize to ensure it is most accurate and up-to-date. Next, we
                        might seek out any information about you that is publicly available on the open
                        market and overlay this data onto ours for comparison purposes. Information
                        collected in this manner could include your spending habits from a mail-order
                        catalogue, demographic information you provided in entering a sweepstakes or
                        your financial history. All of this results in a program that is tailored to
                        your personal interests and provides you with the most relevant reward-earning
                        opportunities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We use this information solely for the purpose of enhancing
                        the offerings of the Program, namely to tailor advertisements, updates and
                        reward-earning and spending offers to your particular interests. All such
                        third-party data processors are contractually bound to observe the strict
                        policy stated herein, so you can rest assured that the confidentiality of your
                        personal information will be maintained.
                    </p>

                    <p>13. Security </p>

                    <p>
                        We endeavor to safeguard and protect our users’ personal
                        information. When users make personal information available to us, their
                        personal information is protected both online and offline (to the extent that
                        we maintain any personal information offline). Where our registration/application
                        process prompts users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card
                        information), and when we store and transmit such sensitive information, that
                        information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Access to your personal information is strictly limited, and
                        we take reasonable measures to ensure that your personal information is not
                        accessible to the public. All of our users’ personal information is restricted
                        in our offices. Only employees or third party agents who need the personal
                        information to perform a specific job are granted access to personal
                        information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy
                        of all user personal information. Employees not adhering to our firm policies
                        are subject to disciplinary action. The servers that we store personal
                        information on are kept in a secure physical environment. We also have security
                        measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of personal
                        information under our control.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Please be advised, however, that while we take every
                        reasonable precaution available to protect your data, no storage facility,
                        technology, software, security protocols or data transmission over the Internet
                        can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Computer hackers that circumvent our
                        security measures may gain access to certain portions of your personal
                        information, and technological bugs, errors and glitches may cause inadvertent
                        disclosures of your personal information; provided, however, that any attempt
                        to breach the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware
                        or software may constitute a crime punishable by law. For the reasons mentioned
                        above, we cannot warrant that your personal information will be absolutely
                        secure. Any transmission of data at or through the Site or otherwise via the
                        Internet or wireless network is at your own risk.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we
                        shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we
                        learn of an information security breach with respect to your personal
                        information. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach.

                    <p>
                        In the event Winloot® goes through a business transition,
                        such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of
                        its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the
                        assets transferred, unless such a transfer will violate state or federal law.
