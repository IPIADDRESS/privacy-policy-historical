<p>
    We  want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or  other information we have collected about you or your activities on our  web site or while using our services.</p>
<p>
    <u>Personal information.</u> We do not share your personal information with others except as  indicated below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to  opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share  personal information with: </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>Authorized service providers:</strong> We may share your personal information with our authorized service  providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services  may include fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments,  delivering packages, providing customer service and marketing  assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our  website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys  and other features offered through our website or performing background  checks of Service Professionals.

      <li>In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law  enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our  legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required  by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or  right available to us. </li>
      <li>When  we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to  investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity,  suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights,  property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others;  to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to  enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or  policies. </li>
      <li>In  connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale  of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale,  or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

We may also share it with third parties  and our sister companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on  our websites and on websites of third parties.

  <ul type="disc">
    <li>You  can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may  result in you being unable to use certain features of our website  because such information may be required in order for you to register for a free remodeling estimate;  to use our services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or  sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our  website. </li>
    <li>At any time a consumer user can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails or newsletters from us by emailing us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@CalFinder.com"><u>unsubscribe@CalFinder.com</u></a>.

 <p>
      <a name="security" id="security"></a><strong><u>How we protect your personal information</u></strong></p>
<p>
    We  take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and  procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from  unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized  employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do  so only for permitted business functions. </p>
 <p>
    We  want you to feel confident using our website to transact business.  However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we  take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you  should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other  communications will always remain secure. Please refer to the Federal  Trade Commission’s website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Blogs, bulletin boards, </u></strong><strong><u>twitter account </u></strong><strong><u>and chat rooms</u></strong> </p>
<p>
    We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others, as well as pos comments (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.). Such postings are governed by our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.  In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when  searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever  you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web  pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected  and used by others. For example, if you post your email address or twitter account,  you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your  posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily  post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with  respect to your personal information. Once you have posted information,  you may not be able to edit or delete such information.</p>

Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that  your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that  your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third  parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>No Rights of Third Parties</u></strong></p>
<p>

<p>
    <strong><u>Changes to this Privacy Policy</u></strong></p>
<p>
    We  will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our  practices and services. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we  will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.  If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or  share your personal information, we will notify you by sending an  e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your  account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an email  address), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our  website. We recommend that you check our website from time to time to  inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our  other policies.</p>

    <a name="cookies" id="cookies"></a>Cookies:</p>
<p>
    A  cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for  record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or  persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your  browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period  of time.</p>
<p>
    You  may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click  "Help" in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so,  some of the features and services of our website may not function  properly.</p>
<p>
    We  may allow third-parties, including advertising companies, and ad  networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may  use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information  about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website  does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but  they may collect information about where you, or others who are using  your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver,  and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to  the advertised websites. They also may combine this information with  personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of  that information is subject to the third-party’s privacy policy. This  information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge  their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies  may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising  Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting  from member companies (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>).</p>

    <a name="web_beacons" id="web_beacons"></a>Web Beacons:</p>
<p>
    Web  beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny  graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and  are used to track the online movements of web users or to access  cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user’s computer hard  drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in  email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
<p>
    Web  beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count  users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns.  We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to  our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party  website.</p>
