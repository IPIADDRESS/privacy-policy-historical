							<li>When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce Window-Price.com terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.</li>
							<li>In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.

					</ul>
					<a id="security" name="security"></a><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How we protect your personal information</span></strong>
					We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions.
					We want you to feel confident using Window-Price.com to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
					<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blogs, bulletin boards, </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">twitter account </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and chat rooms</span></strong>
					We may provide areas on Window-Price.coms where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others, as well as pos comments (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.). Such postings are governed by our <a href="../terms">Terms of Use</a>. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address or twitter account, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information.

					Window-Price.com is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
					<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Visiting Window-Price.coms from outside the United States</span></strong>
					This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on Window-Price.com from residents of the United States.

Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.
					<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No Rights of Third Parties</span></strong>
					This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.

If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an email address), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on Window-Price.com. We recommend that you check Window-Price.com from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.

					<a id="cookies" name="cookies"></a>Cookies:
					A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate Window-Price.com. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
					You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click “Help” in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of Window-Price.com may not function properly.
					We may allow third-parties, including advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Window-Price.com does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party's privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>).
					<a id="web_beacons" name="web_beacons"></a>Web Beacons:
					Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
					Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.
