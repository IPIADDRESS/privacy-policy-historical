    <strong><u>Do Not Call Policy</u></strong>
    <u> </u>
</p>
<p>
    Window-Price takes its responsibilities about customer information and customer service very seriously. In support of this commitment, Windows-Price has
    adopted the following Do Not Call Policy.
</p>
<p>
    No employee or agent of Windows-Price shall engage in telemarketing practices that violate the terms of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the
    FTC Telephone Sales Rule, or state regulation.
</p>
<p>
    Windows-Price maintains a record of the name and telephone number for consumers who do not wish to be called. If you don’t want to receive sales calls from
    Windows-Price, just ask us to place your name on our Do Not Call List. We will note your request immediately, and will remove your information from active
    lists within 30 days.
</p>
<p>
    You can make your request in writing by mailing us at 804 Congress Avenue, Suite 400, Austin, TX 78701or by phone by calling 1-888-643-3888. When you make
    a request you must include your name, address and telephone number(s) you want to be included on our list. If your information changes, please notify us of
    the new name, address, and telephone number(s) in order to remain on our Do Not Call List. If you would like us to remove you from our Do Not Call List in
    order to receive our telephone solicitations, notify us by contacting us at the above address or telephone number.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that Windows-Price’s Do Not Call Policy does not cover independent third parties, so you may continue to receive calls from other companies. If
    you would like to add your number to the National Do Not Call List, you may do so by calling 1-888-382-1222, or visiting www.donotcall.gov.
</p>
<p>
    Also note that being on the Windows-Price’s Do Not Call List restricts telephone solicitations only. We may still contact you about other topics.
</p>
<p>
    All Windows-Price personnel involved with telemarketing and/or telephone solicitation for Windows-Price are trained, informed, and directed to comply with
    Windows-Price Do Not Call Policy.
</p>
<p>
Upon request, Windows-Price will provide its Do Not Call policy. The policy is also available online at the following web address:    <strong><u>http://window-price.com/terms</u></strong>

<p>
    Thank you for your interest in our Privacy and Do Not Call Policies.
