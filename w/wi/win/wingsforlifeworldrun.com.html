<h2 class="policy-content__h2">7 Analysis and advertising tools</h2>
<p class="policy-content__p">7.1 To ensure our online advertising is tailored and interesting for you, we analyse your behaviour on our sites, partner websites, our Apps and your interactions with us. For example, we track when you click articles or our adverts (which are on our websites and third party websites), when you interact with us on social media (by mentioning us or our products), when you directly communicate with us (which may include communicating with our chatbot tools which are used across social media), when you buy tickets to one of our events, when you buy products from us, when you attend our events, when you open and interact with our marketing communications and where you have come from to visit our Website or download our Apps.<br></p>
<p class="policy-content__p">7.2 We use third party tools, including Salesforce DMP. For this purpose, we use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing behaviour and deliver interest-based ads to you. For further information about the use of data by Salesforce DMP please click on the following link: <a href="http://www.krux.com/privacy">http://www.krux.com/privacy</a> .

<p class="policy-content__p">7.3 We also use third party tools, including Facebook Custom Audience to provide advertising to you on other websites (including social media networks such as Facebook). Facebook Custom Audience is a tool provided by Facebook, which matches a Red Bull customer/visitor with a Facebook user in order to provide advertising on the Facebook platform. For this purpose, we share your information with these third party providers (e.g. Facebook) and use cookies or similar technologies on our website to analyse the effectiveness of our advertising on other websites. For more information about the use of data by Facebook, please click on the following link: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/about">https://www.facebook.com/ads/about</a>.

<h2 class="policy-content__h2">8 Cookies and other technologies</h2>
<p class="policy-content__p">8.1 We collect information automatically through the use of "cookies". Cookies may be set by us, or they may be set by third parties. A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as a tag that distinguishes your computer but does not name you. Some of our Website pages use cookies to better serve you when you return to the Website. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies; however, if you do this, some of our Website may not work properly.<br></p>
<p class="policy-content__p">8.2 We also make use of "web beacons" also commonly known as "single pixel GIFs", "clear GIFs" or "tags". Web beacons are small graphic images that may be included on our Website. Web beacons allow us optimise our products and services and provide us and third-party partners with analytics information, such as how many visitors our Website receives. We may also use web beacons in our email correspondence to determine whether you open them or take any further action. We also work with other organisations to place our web beacons on their websites or in their advertisements. We do this to helps us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Red Bull website results in a purchase or other interaction on the advertiser's website.<br></p>
<p class="policy-content__p">8.3 For our Apps, we collect information automatically through the use of unique device identifiers ("<strong class="policy-content__strong">IDs</strong>"). An ID is a specific string of numbers and letters (a "character string") which is assigned to your device, but does not name you. The ID allows us and our selected third parties to track your behaviour when you use the App.  Almost every App uses ID technology. IDs serve a number of purposes such as remembering your preferences, and generally improving your user experience. IDs may tell us, for example, whether you have used our Apps before or whether you are a new user. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see through the Apps are more relevant to you and your interests. This functionality makes IDs extremely useful to improve your user experience.<br></p>
<p class="policy-content__p">8.4 For information about the specific cookies, web beacons and IDs, please refer to our <a href="cookie.html">Cookies Policy</a>.<br></p>
<h2 class="policy-content__h2">9 Links to other websites and social media</h2>
<p class="policy-content__p">9.1 Where we provide links to other websites, we do so for information purposes only. The other websites are outside our control and are not covered by this Policy.

<p class="policy-content__p">9.2 In some pages of our Website, third parties that provide content, applications or plug-ins through our Website may track your use of content, applications and plug-ins or customize content, applications and plug-ins for you.  For example, when you share an article using a social media sharing button on our Website (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, or Google Plus), the social network that has created the button will record that you have done this.  For more information on social media plug-ins on our Website, see our Cookie Policy.<br></p>
