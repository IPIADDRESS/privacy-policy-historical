The Nationals will give the call to 31-year old left-hander Gio Gonzalez, and the Dodgers will send 30-year old left-hander Hyun-Jin Ryu to the mound. The Dodgers won five of six over the Nationals last season.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='second-quarter'>\n<h3>Gonzalez Looks to Continue Career Dominance over Dodgers<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/m.mlb.com\/player\/461829\/gio-gonzalez\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gio Gonzalez<\/a> will make his 12th start of the season, aiming for win number five. Gonzalez tallied the Quality Start in his previous outing, allowing three runs in six innings to the Giants and recorded the win to bring his record to 4-1. The veteran right-hander is having another fantastic season, posting a 3.03 ERA and a 1.40 WHIP in 68.1 innings pitched. He features outstanding numbers in his career against the Dodgers, going 3-1 with a stifling 1.69 ERA in five career starts. Yasiel Puig is 1 for 11 against Gonzalez, while Adrian Gonzalez is 2 for 17, and Justin Turner is 2 for 19 with two RBI\u2019s. Daniel Murphy has been very productive as of late, collecting 13 hits along with five RBI\u2019s over his last five games. The 32-year old second baseman is having another outstanding season, currently hitting .343 with ten home runs and 38 RBI\u2019s, and is interestingly hitting .386 on the road compared to .287 at home. Murphy went 5 for 23 with two RBI\u2019s in six games against the Dodgers last season.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Nationals are currently averaging a Major League best 5.61 runs per game, and are hitting .277 as a team. The Washington pitching has been outstanding as of late, featuring a 4.09 ERA, placing them 10th in the Majors.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='third-quarter'>\n<h3>Ryu Faces Nationals for First Time<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/m.mlb.com\/player\/547943\/hyun-jin-ryu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hyun-Jin Ryu<\/a> will get the call for the tenth time of the season, searching for his third win. Ryu was outstanding in his previous start, holding the Cardinals to one run over seven innings, and finished with the no decision. The 6-foot-2 left-hander is having a solid season with the exception of a couple starts, and currently features a 3.91 ERA and a<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>1.39 WHIP to go along with a 2-5 record in 46 innings logged.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Ryu, who will be facing the Nationals for the first time of his career, has only allowed a total of two home runs over his last six starts. Adrian Gonzalez has been productive as of late, collecting nine RBI\u2019s over his last 13 games. The 13-year veteran first baseman has been inconsistent at times but he appears to be back on track, currently hitting .262 with one homer and 21 RBI\u2019s on the season. Gonzalez went just 4 for 22 with two RBI\u2019s in six games against the Nationals last season.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Dodgers are currently averaging 4.96 runs per game, ranking them sixth in the Major Leagues, and own a .255 team batting average. The L.A pitching continues to shine, boasting a Major-League leading 3.20 team ERA.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'>\n<p><strong>Trends:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Washington Nationals are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>under is 4-0 in their last 4 games against a left-handed starter.<\/li>\n<li>under is 6-1-1 in their last 8 games against the NL West.<\/li>\n<li>under is 5-1-1 in their last 7 games against a starter with a WHIP greater than 1.30.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The L.A.

Furthermore, Ryu features a solid 2.97 ERA over his last six appearances, plus the Dodgers bullpen continues to dominate. The Nationals have slowed down a bit offensively as of late, and I can&#8217;t see the Nationals scoring many runs against the Dodgers who lead the Majors in team ERA.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Pick: Under 8<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n","promo":"Hyun-Jin Ryu and the L.A.

That was then and this is now as they already have 29 wins in the year and are in first place in the American League Central. They lead their division by one game over the Indians. The Twins come in off a four-game series in Anaheim and they took three of the four games from the Halos. The Twins were 29-52 on the road last year, but so far this year they have gone 17-6 on the road, compared to going just 12-18 at home. This is one of the biggest surprises in the league and they do have a shot at going from the worst team in the league to getting a playoff berth. The Twins will trot out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twinkietown.com\/2017\/5\/31\/15721344\/houston-astros-17-minnesota-twins-6-team-still-stinking-sinking-hector-santiago-george-springer\">Hector Santiago<\/a> in this game and he has gone 4-5 with a 4.76 ERA in 12 games (11 starts) on the year, including 1-2 with a 5.23 ERA in four starts on the road. Santiago has gone 4-5 with a 4.30 ERA in 29 games (17 starts) during June, while against the Mariners in his career he has gone 4-3 with a 3.09 ERA in 15 games (seven starts), including 2-1 with a 2.22 ERA in eight games (three starts) here at Safeco. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Twins have been a decent offensive team so far as they come in ranked 13th in the league in scoring, putting up 4.64 rpg, while also ranking 14th in hitting at .252 and 21st in homers with 64. On the mound they have been poor so far as they come in ranked 24th in the league in ERA at 4.60, while also ranking 21st in WHIP at 1.37.<\/span><\/div>\n<div class='third-quarter'>\n<h3>Mariners Crush Rays In Three-Game Set<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Seattle Mariners have been playing very well of late as they come into this series having won seven of their last eight games. In their last series, they took on a solid Tampa Bay team at home and won all three games, outscoring them by a count of 28-7 in the process. The Mariners have now averaged 7.13 rpg in their last eight games while allowing just 2.75 rpg over that same stretch. This is a team that is rolling right now, but still they are two games under .500 for the year and 13.5 games out of first in the AL West. The good news is that they are 17-10 at home and just 2.5 games out of a wildcard spot in the American League. Getting the nod for the Mariners will be <a href=\"http:\/\/emeraldcityswagger.com\/2017\/06\/01\/seattle-mariners-james-paxton-continues-where-he-left-off\/\">James Paxton<\/a> and he has gone 4-0 with a 1.26 ERA in seven starts so far, including 3-0 with a 0.35 ERA in four starts here at home. Paxton has gone 1-3 with a 4.15 ERA in six career starts in June and he is 12-8 with a 2.68 ERA in 27 career starts here at Petco, while against the Twins in his career he has gone 1-1 with a 1.54 ERA in two starts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Mariners have been an average offensive team so far as they come in ranked 14th in the league in scoring, putting up 4.64 rpg, while also ranking 8th in hitting at .262 and 24th in homers with 59. On the mound they have been poor in the early going as they come in ranked 23rd in the league in ERA at 4.54 while also ranking 15th in WHIP at 1.33.<\/span><\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'>\n<p><b>Trends<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Minnesota is:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1-4 in their last five when their opponent scores five runs or more in their previous game<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Seattle is:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6-1 in their last seven vs. a team with a winning record<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4-1 in Paxton\u2019s last five starts after allowing two runs or less in their previous game<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Mariners have been on a roll, but the Twins are leading their division and they have been very strong on the road this year with a 17-6 record. Something has to give in this series and in game one I see the Mariners as having a big edge. Seattle just outscored a Tampa Bay team at home by a count of 28-7 and they have now averaged 7.13 rpg in their last eight games. Minnesota will be sending out Hector Santiago and he has struggled of late as he has gone 0-2 with a 6.61 ERA in his last three starts and he is 1-2 with a 5.23 ERA on the road. Half of Minnesota\u2019s road losses this year have come with him on the mound. The Mariners will send out James Paxton, who has been nearly unhittable this year, especially here at home where he has gone 3-0 with a 0.35 ERA in four starts. Minnesota has a good offense, but they just won\u2019t score nearly enough off of Paxton to keep this one close. Take the Mariners on the RL. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Pick: Seattle -1.5<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n","promo":"Major League Baseball action on Tuesday evening and the Minnesota Twins will head to the great northwest to rumble with the Seattle Mariners in game one of their three-game series from Safeco Field.

Well, things don\u2019t always go as planned as the Mets allowed 25 games in the three-game series. In the series finale, they were blasted by a score of 11-1. Rookie <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/06\/05\/sports\/baseball\/another-gloomy-monday-for-the-mets-and-their-fans.html?_r=0\">Tyler Pill<\/a> got the start in the game and it was just his 2bd career start. It didn\u2019t go well as he allowed five runs (three earned) on eight hits in five innings of work, but the bullpen struggled as well as they allowed the fine six runs in just four innings. That pen has not been good at all so far and they now rank 26th in the league with a 4.81 ERA from their pen so far. Taking the hill for the Mets will be Jacob deGrom and he has gone 4-2 with a 3.97 ERA in 11 starts on the year, including 3-0 with a 3.89 ERA in six starts on the road. deGrom has gone 4-6 with a 2.64 ERA in 15 career starts during the month of June and he is 5-3 with a 1.95 ERA in 11 interleague starts. This will be his first-ever meeting with the Rangers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Mets have been a solid offensive team so far as they come in ranked 8th in the league in scoring, putting up 4.89 rpg, while also ranking 21st in hitting at .244 and 11th in homers with 75. On the mound they have been poor as they come in ranked 28th in the league in ERA at 4.91, while also ranking 30th in WHIP at 1.49.<\/span><\/div>\n<div class='third-quarter'>\n<h3>Rangers Get Swept At Home By Astros<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Houston Astros are clearly the best team in the league right now and the Rangers found that out the hard way as they just lost all three games at home in this series over the weekend with the powerful \u2018Stros. They were outscored 20-8 in the three games and have now lost four games in a row overall and 10 of their last 12 to fall to five games under .500 and 15.0 games out of first place in the AL West, The Rangers had been pitching well earlier in the year, but that pitching has really broken down of late as they have a 5.32 ERA in their last 10 games, including an ERA of 7.12 from their starters over that same stretch. Despite losing all three to the Mets, the Rangers are still 17-13 here at home. Getting the nod for the Rangers will be <a href=\"http:\/\/www.timesrecordnews.com\/story\/sports\/mlb\/rangers\/2017\/06\/05\/trn-rangers-report-gee-getting-first-start-texas\/102521142\/\">Dillon Gee<\/a> and he has gone 0-0 with a 0.00 ERA in two games out of the pen this year. Gee has pitched 6.2 innings this year and has allowed just four hits in his time on the mound. He is 44-45 with a 4.15 ERA in 124 career games as a starter and 6-7 with a 4.07 ERA in 19 games (14 starts) in interleague play, plus 1-1 with a 3.38 ERA in four games ( three starts) in his career here at Globe Life Park. This will be his first career start against his former team. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Rangers have been an above average team on offense so far as they come in ranked 12th in the league in scoring, putting up 4.68 rpg, while also ranking 24th in hitting at .239 and 12th in homers with 74. On the mound they have been a bit below average so far as they come in ranked 20th in the league in ERA at 4.36, while also ranking 24th in WHIP at 1.39.<\/span><\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'>\n<p><b>Trends<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>New York is:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">25-11 in their last 36 games following an off day<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">20-7 in deGrom\u2019s last 27 starts after scoring two runs or less in their previous game<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Texas is:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2-7 in their last nine games following a loss<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1-7 in their last eight when their opponent allows 5 runs or more in their previous game<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Mets have been struggling of late, but so have the Rangers and that will make this interleague battle an interesting one. The Mets have a decided edge on the mound in this one with deGrom over Gee and that should lead them to victory here. The Mets have had their issues on the mound this year, but Jacob deGrom has not been one of them and he really pitches well in interleague play as his 1.95 ERA in 11 starts would indicate. Dillon Gee has not been a great starter in his career and he was 8-9 with a 4.68 ERA in 33 games (14 starts) for the Royals last year. He also has a 4.07 ERA in interleague play and the Mets have an offense that can do damage against him, especially in a park like this, which is very hitter-friendly. The Rangers were just swept at home by the Astros and I do not see them recovering for this battle with a Mets team that has a decided edge on the mound. Take New York in game one. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Pick: New York -130<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n","promo":"Tonight in interleague play, the National League East meets the American League West as the New York Mets battle it out with the Texas Rangers in game one of their two-game series from Globe Life Park in Arlington, Texas.
