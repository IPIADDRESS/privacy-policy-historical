Green Bay is 1-4 in its last five outings after most recently succumbing to Atlanta, Indianapolis, and Tennessee. The Redskins returned from their bye week to defeat Minnesota 26-20 last weekend.<\/p><\/div>\n<div class='second-quarter'>\n<h3>Waiting for the running game<\/h3>\n<p>After a shaky start to the season in the passing game, the Packers\u2019 aerial attack has gotten back on track in recent weeks thanks to Aaron Rodgers. Granted, that has not meant their win-loss column has improved. But, individually, Rodgers is once again doing work. The former University of California standout has thrown 22 touchdowns and two interceptions this year, with a 12-to-3 ratio in that department in the last four weeks.\u00a0Rodgers does, of course, benefit from a stellar pass-catching trio. Jordy Nelson, Randall Cobb, and Davante Adams\u00a0all have at least 45 receptions and 433 yards, and they have combined for\u00a017 touchdowns.<\/p>\n<p>Green Bay&#8217;s running game, however, is a different story. Week 1 starter Eddie Lacy was placed on injured reserve last month because of an ankle injury and backup James Starks has missed significant after undergoing knee surgery last month. Starks returned to action last week against the Titans\u00a0but gained a mere 33 yards on seven carries.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/div>\n<div class='third-quarter'>\n<h3>Clutch play<\/h3>\n<div class=\"subscriber-preview\">\n<p>Washington&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/nfl\/recap?gameId=400874576\" target=\"_blank\">six-point win over the Vikings<\/a> last weekend marked the seventh time this season that it has contested a game decided by one score. The Redskins are now 4-2-1 in such situations. They got the job done at Minnesota&#8217;s expense despite giving up 20 unanswered points to end the first half. The Vikings, however, did not score a single point over the final 30 minutes. Washington, on the other hand, engineered four scoring drives in the second half. All resulted in field goals by Dustin Hopkins.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"subscriber-only\">\n<p>&#8220;We have a pretty good resolve in this locker room,&#8221; linebacker Ryan Kerrigan explained. &#8220;We know every game is going to be close. You rarely have a game where you just beat a team 40-0. We know most games we&#8217;re playing are going to be close, and you have to have that mindset going into every game that you have to play for a full 60 minutes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'><strong>NFL Trends<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>The Green Bay Packers\u00a0are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>5-1 Over in their last six games following a loss<\/li>\n<li>4-1 Over in their last five games following an ATS loss<\/li>\n<li>6-1 Over in their last seven games after allowing more than 450 yards of total offense in their previous game<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Washington Redskins are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>16-5 Over in their last 21 overall<\/li>\n<li>7-0 Over in their last seven\u00a0home games<\/li>\n<li>8-1 Over in their last nine games against the\u00a0NFC<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Redskins pinned a decent 26 points on a vaunted Minnesota defense and they should have scored even more. After all, they converted a touchdown on only one of four trips to the red zone and settled for a quartet of second-half field goals. Washington may have to start punching it in this weekend because Green Bay boasts a formidable offense with Rodgers at the helm.

The team converted off of two turnovers in the final stanza and Cairo Santos kicked a 37-yard field on the game&#8217;s final play to give KC the three-point victory. Safety Eric Berry had a 42-yard interception return for a touchdown to help with the cause. Spencer Ware gained 61 yards on the ground from 13 carries but the Chiefs lost the yardage battle 341-256.

The 49ers tied the game with less than two minutes remaining, but <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nfl.com\/player\/carsonpalmer\/2505245\/profile\" target=\"_blank\">Carson Palmer<\/a> came up clutch with a late drive getting his team into field goal position, and Chandler Catanzaro converted on a 34-yard field goal with no time left on the clock. Carson Palmer was productive throwing for a season-high 376 yards, however, he only threw one touchdown with two interceptions. The veteran quarterback has accumulated 2444 passing yards but has a mediocre 11:8 TD to INT ratio. David Johnson did score two touchdowns in the win, but only rushed for 55 yards off 19 carries. Johnson is having a solid season, rushing for a total of 760 yards with nine touchdowns this season. Larry Fitzgerald had his biggest game of the season, making 12 grabs for 133 yards, and has now tallied 687 receiving yards, but has now gone four consecutive games without a touchdown. Fitzgerald is playing with a sprained ankle and a swollen knee, showing great character playing through the pain. Arizona is now averaging 22.4 points per game, ranking them 20th in the NFL. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Cardinals defense allowed the 49ers to hang around after jumping out to a 14-0 lead last week\u00a0and has some trouble with Kaepernick at times. Chandler Jones made two sacks and now leads the Cardinals with seven sacks on the year. Arizona is now allowing an average of 17.8 points per game, ranking them third overall.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='third-quarter'>\n<h3>Vikings Fall to Redskins, Lose Fourth Straight<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Minnesota Vikings downward spiral continues after 26-20 road loss to the Redskins, extending the Vikings losing streak to four games after a 5-0 start. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nfl.com\/player\/sambradford\/497095\/profile\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Bradford<\/a> connected on 31 of 40 passes for a season-high 307 yards with two touchdowns but threw a costly interception in the fourth quarter. Overall the 29-year old quarterback has looked good for the Vikings, throwing for 2022 yards with a terrific 11:2 TD to INT ratio.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>The Vikings struggling running game is really hurting them offensively, rushing for only 47 yards as team in the loss last week. Jerick McKinnon and Matt Asiata have been splitting the carries and the two have combined to rush for just 481 yards. Stefon Diggs was outstanding last week, making 13 catches for 164 yards. The second-year wide receiver is a tremendous talent, leading the Vikings with 61 receptions and 710 receiving yards. The Vikings desperately need a win, but it will not be easy facing the Cardinals this week, followed by a huge Thanksgiving game against the Detroit Lions, who they are currently tied with in the division with a 5-4 record. Minnesota is now averaging 19.4 points per game, ranking them down at 26th overall. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Vikings defense was not as sharp as usual in the loss to the Redskins, allowing 388 total yards, which is above their average of 310 yards allowed per game. Overall, the Vikings defense has been tremendous, conceding an average of 16.9 points per game, placing them first overall.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'><strong>Trends:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Arizona Cardinals are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>under is 12-3-1 in their last 16 games against a team with a winning record.<\/li>\n<li>under is 8-0 in their last 8 games after accumulating 350 or more total yards in their previous game.<\/li>\n<li>under is 4-1 in their last 5 games against the Vikings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The Minnesota Vikings are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>under is 9-1 in their last 10 games following an ATS loss.<\/li>\n<li>under is 4-1 in their last 5 home games.<\/li>\n<li>under is 8-2 in their last 10 games following a straight up loss.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I like the under in this matchup as both teams feature very strong defensive units. The Vikings still own the NFL\u2019s top-ranked defense, and have the sixth-ranked pass defense, so I expect them to contain the Cardinals offense which has not been very impressive this season, and Minnesota should make things difficult for Palmer and Fitzgerald, who is playing with a few injuries. Also, the Vikings offense has struggled, averaging only 14 points per game over their four-game losing streak, and own the worst running game in the NFL, so I expect the Cardinals third-ranked defense to contain the Vikings offense. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Pick: Under 41<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n","promo":"Carson Palmer and the Arizona Cardinals will square off with Sam Bradford and the struggling Minnesota Vikings Sunday afternoon from U.S. Bank Stadium.","thumb":"https:\/\/misc-rnnukmcdu8mee.netdna-ssl.com\/san\/uploads\/2016\/11\/USATSI_9674910-300x225.jpg","full_image":"https:\/\/misc-rnnukmcdu8mee.netdna-ssl.com\/san\/uploads\/2016\/11\/USATSI_9674910-450x300.jpg","writer":"13","published":"2016-11-14T13:28:54-05:00","modified":"2016-11-16T17:16:48-05:00"},{"game_id":"177919","slug":"\/games\/nfl\/11-20-2016\/bills-vs-bengals-112016-expert-prediction\/","title":"Bills vs. Bengals, 11\/20\/16 - Expert Prediction","content":"<div class='first-quarter'>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Buffalo Bills (4-5; 4-5 ATS; 7-2 O\/U) vs. Cincinnati Bengals (3-5-1; 3-6 ATS; 5-4 O\/U)<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">NFL: Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:00pm EST<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Line: Cincinnati -3<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Total: 47<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Cincinnati Bengals will host the Buffalo Bills in an AFC matchup Sunday afternoon from Paul Brown Stadium.

The Bengals could not come up with the big play and had a tough time with the Giants offense. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nfl.com\/player\/andydalton\/2495143\/profile\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Dalton<\/a> was mediocre, converting on only 16 of his 29 passes for 204 yards with one touchdown and one interception. Overall, Dalton isn\u2019t quite having the season he had last season, throwing for a total of 2553 yards with a 10:4 TD to INT ratio. A.J. Green did make seven catches in the loss but for a total of only of 68 yards. The star receiver is having another solid season, catching for 120 or more yards in four games this season, racking up 964 receiving yards with four touchdowns. The Bengals have not been able to find their offense all season, and with only seven games remaining they need to go on a winning streak immediately. The Bengals are only averaging 20.8 points per game, ranking them 22nd overall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Bengals defense had trouble stopping Manning and the Giants running game last week but overall their defense kept them in the game. The Bengals did make two interceptions on Monday night\u00a0and are now tied for sixth in the NFL with nine interceptions on the season. Cincinnati is now allowing an average of 23.3 points per game, placing them 18th overall.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'><strong>Trends:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Buffalo Bills are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>4-1 ATS in their last 5 games in Cincinnati.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The Cincinnati Bengals are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>1-4 ATS in their last 5 games overall.<\/li>\n<li>1-3-1 ATS in their last 5 games after allowing more than 350 total yards in their previous game.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I am taking the points with the Bills in this matchup. I really like what I have seen from Tyrod Taylor going against the Patriots and Seahawks in their two latest games. The Bills own the number two ranked running game in the NFL, and the Bengals have struggled to stop the run so I expect both McCoy and Taylor to both have success running the ball on offense. Also, Dalton hasn&#8217;t quite been the same as last year, and the Bills feature a solid secondary that has had success defending the pass and I feel they will do a good job containing Dalton. Take the points with the Bills in this one.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<h3>Pick: Buffalo Bills +3<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n","promo":"Tyrod Taylor and the Buffalo Bills will look to snap a three game losing streak when they take on the Cincinnati Bengals Sunday afternoon from Paul Brown Stadium in Cincinnati.","thumb":"https:\/\/misc-rnnukmcdu8mee.netdna-ssl.com\/san\/uploads\/2016\/11\/USATSI_9677641-300x225.jpg","full_image":"https:\/\/misc-rnnukmcdu8mee.netdna-ssl.com\/san\/uploads\/2016\/11\/USATSI_9677641-450x300.jpg","writer":"13","published":"2016-11-15T16:15:11-05:00","modified":"2016-11-16T17:19:54-05:00"},{"game_id":"177920","slug":"\/games\/nfl\/11-20-2016\/ravens-vs-cowboys-112016-prediction-preview\/","title":"Ravens vs. Cowboys, 11\/20\/16 - Prediction & Preview","content":"<div class='first-quarter'>Baltimore Ravens (5-4 SU, 4-5 ATS, 3-5 O\/U) at Dallas Cowboys (8-1 SU, 8-1 ATS, 4-5 O\/U)<\/p>\n<p>When and Where: Sunday, Nov. 20, AT&amp;T Stadium, Arlington, Tx., 1pmET<\/p>\n<p>Line: Dallas Cowboys -7<\/p>\n<p>Total: 45<\/p>\n<p>The Dallas Cowboys hope to make it nine wins in a row when they host the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday.

That might have changed after an impressive second half performance against the Browns, as Joe Flacco threw three touchdown passes. That&#8217;s after the Ravens trailed Cleveland 7-6 at the half and Flacco threw two interceptions. Flacco ended up throwing for 296 yards won 30 of 41 passing. The veteran quarterback has been disappointing this season, coming off ACL surgery. He has completed 62.5 percent of his passes for 2,374 yards with nine TDs and nine picks with a 78.3 quarterback rating.<\/p>\n<p>The Ravens could also use help for a running game that has been inconsistent all season.

That gave the home team a 30-29 lead, but Dallas has something Pittsburgh doesn&#8217;t-the top two rookies in the NFL. Rookie quarterback <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/sports\/nfl\/la-sp-cowboys-prescott-romo-20161114-story.html\">Dak Prescott<\/a> drove the Steelers down the field and a Steelers&#8217; facemask penalty on Jason Witten helped them get into field goal range. Instead of having Dan Bailey kick the game winner, rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott ran it up the middle from 32 yards to give the Cowboys the 35-30 win.<\/p>\n<p>This was pretty much an improbable win for the Cowboys, who gave up 400 passing yards and forced no turnovers. Yet Prescott nearly matched Roethlisberger, going 22 of 32 for 319 yards and two TDs. Elliott was sensational with 21 carries for 114 yards and two scores. He also had two catches for 95 yards, including an 83 yard TD reception. The first-year back from Ohio State now has 1,005 yards rushing and nine TDs. Prescott has thrown for 2,339 yards with 14 TDs and just two picks with a 106.2 passer rating. He also has four rushing touchdowns. On offense, Dallas ranks third in the NFL with 412.7 yards per game and first in rushing with 161 yards per games. Defensively, the Cowboys rank third against the run (82.6ypg), but just 21st against the pass (263.1ypg).<\/p><\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'>NFL Trends:<\/p>\n<p>Baltimore is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>2-5 ATS last 7 overall.<\/li>\n<li>1-5-1 ATS last 7 following a SU win of more than 14 points.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Dallas is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>7-0 ATS last 7 following a SU win.<\/li>\n<li>5-1 ATS last 6 after scoring more than 30 points in their previous game.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s tough to see how the Ravens can hang in this game. Their offense has to rely on a big game from Flacco, who hasn&#8217;t produced in two years against a quality team. The Ravens need to make this a low-scoring game and while their defense has overachieved, they do have several holes in the secondary. Their lack of speed in the back end will be costly.<br \/>\n<h3>Pick: Dallas -7.5<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n","promo":"The Dallas Cowboys hope to make it nine wins in a row when they host the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday.

The Steelers are coming off a tough 35-30 home loss to the Cowboys, and the Browns fell 28-7 to the Ravens last Thursday night. Pittsburgh defeated the Browns in both meetings last season.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='second-quarter'>\n<h3>Steelers Falls to Cowboys in Fourth Consecutive Loss<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Pittsburgh Steelers lost a heartbreaker by a score of 35-30 to the Cowboys and have now lost four consecutive games. The Steelers scored a touchdown with 43 seconds remaining to take a 30-29 lead, however the Cowboys came marching down he field and rookie-sensation Ezekiel Elliot scored a touchdown on a 32 yard run to send his team to victory. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nfl.com\/player\/benroethlisberger\/2506109\/profile\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Roethlisberger<\/a> was tremendous, connecting on 37 of his 46 passes for 308 yards with three touchdowns and zero interceptions. The 34-year old quarterback is having another terrific season, accumulating 2357 passing yards with a 20:7 TD to INT ratio, and he really isn\u2019t at fault for this loss, however he was not himself in his previous two games. Antonio Brown had a huge game, making 14 catches for 154 yards and one touchdown. The star receiver is having an outstanding season, racking up 831 passing yard with seven touchdowns, and he is not at fault during this four game losing streak. Pittsburgh desperately needs to pull off a winning streak, and they will likely get the ball rolling in what is almost an automatic win against the Browns in this matchup. The Steelers are now averaging 23.8 points per game, ranking them 15th overall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Steelers defense did not play well in the loss to the Cowboys, conceding 422 total yards, and could not come up with any big plays during the Cowboys game-winning drive. The Steelers have had a tough time defending the pass this season, and are now conceding an average of 22.9 points per game, placing them 16th overall.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='third-quarter'>\n<h3>Browns Off to Worst Start in Franchise History<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Cleveland Browns held a 7-6 halftime lead, but fell apart in the second half and lost 28-7 to the Ravens in their tenth consecutive loss. The Browns have now begun the season with an 0-10 record for the first time in franchise history. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nfl.com\/draft\/2016\/profiles\/cody-kessler?id=2555387\" target=\"_blank\">Cody Kessler<\/a> was benched in the second half although he did not perform all that badly, throwing one touchdown with no interceptions, but only threw for 91 yards. The rookie quarterback has looked good at times, throwing for a total of 1241 yards with a 6:1 TD to INT ratio, and will get the start in this contest. Isaiah Crowell struggled on the ground again last week, rushing for only 23 yards off nine carries. The third-year running back has not performed up to expectations, reaching the 100 yard mark just twice this season, and has rushed for a total of 551 yards on the season. The Browns face a very tough schedule in their remaining six games and could very well go 0-16. Cleveland is scoring an average of only 17.5 points per game, ranking them 30th overall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Browns defense was outstanding in the first half last week, but struggled in the second half where they surrendered three touchdowns. Joe Haden made an interception in the loss, and now has three interceptions with 24 tackles on the season. The Cleveland defense has been abysmal, conceding an average of 30.1 points per game, ranking them 31st in the NFL.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'><strong>Trends:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Pittsburgh Steelers are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>20-6-2 ATS in their last 28 games after conceding more than 30 points in their previous game.<\/li>\n<li>the favorite is 4-1 ATS in their last 5 games between the Steelers and Browns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The Cleveland Browns are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>0-8 ATS in their last 8 games against the AFC North.<\/li>\n<li>0-5 ATS in their last five home games.<\/li>\n<li>0-7 ATS in their last 7 games in November.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I am going with the Steelers with this reasonable spread. I have gone against the Browns all season and will continue to do so in this matchup.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>I expect the Steelers to take their frustration out on this terrible Browns squad, and expect a huge game from Roethlisberger, Brown and Bell against the 31st ranked defense in the NFL. The Browns are allowing an average of 131 rushing yards per game, so I expect Bell to have a monster game and rack up well over 100 rushing yards. Also, the Browns do not have the talent to get in Roethlisberger\u2019s face, and Brown should have his way downfield as well. I am not worried about the Steelers shaky pass defense going against one of the worst passing games in the NFL. Go with the Steelers as they should take this one in a huge blowout.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Pick: Pittsburgh Steelers -9<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n","promo":"Ben Roethlisberger and the Pittsburgh Steelers will look to snap a four game losing streak when they take on the Cleveland Browns Sunday afternoon from FirstEnergy Stadium.","thumb":"https:\/\/misc-rnnukmcdu8mee.netdna-ssl.com\/san\/uploads\/2016\/11\/USATSI_9675763-300x225.jpg","full_image":"https:\/\/misc-rnnukmcdu8mee.netdna-ssl.com\/san\/uploads\/2016\/11\/USATSI_9675763-433x300.jpg","writer":"13","published":"2016-11-14T12:25:54-05:00","modified":"2016-11-15T17:21:46-05:00"}]},"nba":{"subheader":"NBA on Sunday, 11-20-2016","games":[{"game_id":"239257","slug":"\/games\/nba\/11-20-2016\/chicago-bulls-vs-los-angeles-lakers-112016-prediction\/","title":"Chicago Bulls vs. Los Angeles Lakers, 11\/20\/16 - Prediction","content":"<div class='first-quarter'>Chicago Bulls\u00a0(8-4 SU, 8-4\u00a0ATS, 4-8\u00a0O\/U) vs. Los Angeles Lakers\u00a0(7-6 SU, 8-4-1\u00a0ATS, 9-4\u00a0O\/U)<\/p>\n<p>NBA: Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 9:30 p.m. EST<\/p>\n<p>The Line: LA Clippers -7.

Guard Louis Williams poured in 24 points in a reserve role, fellow guard Jordan Clarkson\u00a0came off the bench to score 20 points, and Nick Young contributed 22 in 28 minutes of work for head coach Luke Walton.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLuke\u2019s done a great job of making them believe and playing aggressively, and you can really see it,\u201d San Antonio head coach Gregg Popovich said. \u201cWe got after it and executed better, but I am just so impressed [with] what he has done with this group.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe just compete,\u201d said Clarkson.\u00a0\u201cWe ain\u2019t OK with any loss.

\u00a0What is still considered to be a pass-oriented team out-gained the visiting Broncos 218-33 on the ground behind three touchdowns from Latavius Murray. \u00a0Murray, along with running backs Jalen Richard and DeAndre Washington, put on a clinic in what was one of the best rushing performances in the NFL this year. \u00a0Derek Carr threw for just 184 yards, but didn&#8217;t make any mistakes that would&#8217;ve cost his team field position or points.<\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'>NFL Trends:<\/p>\n<p>The Texans are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>1-8 ATS in their last 9 Monday games<\/li>\n<li>3-12-1 ATS in their last 16 games after accumulating more than 150 yards rushing in their previous game<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Raiders are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>4-0 ATS in their last 4 games following a bye week<\/li>\n<li>4-1 ATS vs. a team with a winning record<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Houston&#8217;s record doesn&#8217;t necessarily indicate where they&#8217;re at as a football team. \u00a0The Texans have looked relatively overmatched against good competition, and are just 2-3 against teams with a winning record. \u00a0Oakland will provide an adequate challenge on Monday night, and I expect them to impose their will on Houston in both the run and pass games. \u00a0The Raiders showed two weeks ago that the stage wasn&#8217;t too big for them, and now they&#8217;ll have a chance to prove that once again.<br \/>\n<h3>The Pick: Oakland Raiders -5.5<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n","promo":"The Houston Texans and Oakland Raiders travel to Estadio Azteca for the NFL's first-ever Monday Night Football game played outside of the U.S.  Brock Osweiler and Derek Carr will face off in a battle of two of the best young quarterbacks in the league.","thumb":"https:\/\/misc-rnnukmcdu8mee.netdna-ssl.com\/san\/uploads\/2016\/11\/USATSI_9660688_168381572_lowres-300x225.jpg","full_image":"https:\/\/misc-rnnukmcdu8mee.netdna-ssl.com\/san\/uploads\/2016\/11\/USATSI_9660688_168381572_lowres-421x300.jpg","writer":"19","published":"2016-11-15T13:17:44-05:00","modified":"2016-11-17T22:02:10-05:00"}]}},"11-19-2016":{"ncaaf":{"subheader":"NCAAF on Saturday, 11-19-2016","games":[{"game_id":"155108","slug":"\/games\/ncaaf\/11-19-2016\/utah-state-vs-nevada-111916-preview-prediction\/","title":"Utah State vs. Nevada, 11\/19\/16 - Preview & Prediction","content":"<div class='first-quarter'>Utah State vs. Nevada<\/p>\n<p>NCAA Football: \u00a0Saturday, November 19th, 4:00 pm EST<\/p>\n<p>Line: \u00a0Utah State -5.5<\/p>\n<p>Total: 52.5<\/p>\n<p>Utah State heads to Nevada to take on the Wolfpack on Saturday in a Mountain West battle. \u00a0The Aggies lost their third straight on Saturday, going down to New Mexico 24-21.\u00a0 It was also their sixth loss in seven games and dropped them to 1-6 in the Mountain West and 3-7 overall. \u00a0 Nevada is 1-5 in the conference and 3-7 overall as well. \u00a0They lost their fourth straight and sixth of seven on Saturday, as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/college-football\/game?gameId=400869245\">conference powerhouse San Diego State beat them 46-16.<\/a><\/div>\n<div class='second-quarter'>\n<h3>Utah State loses again<\/h3>\n<p>Utah State lost to New Mexico on Saturday, but it was actually one of their more impressive games of the season. \u00a0New Mexico is 7-3 overall and 5-1 in the Mountain West and the Aggies hung with them for the whole game. \u00a0The total yardage was 403 to 391 with a slight edge to the Lobos. \u00a0A field goal with a minute left did them in, but they should hold their heads high. \u00a0Quarterback Kent Myers was a sparkling 21\/27 through the air for 263 yards with a touchdown and an interception. \u00a0Most impressively, he completed passes to 10 different wide receivers.

They turned it around after coming back to beat Minnesota in overtime on Oct. 1 and has beaten the likes of Ohio State (24-21) and Iowa (41-14) in their winning streak. They struggled on the road against Indiana, getting behind 24-21 late in the third quarter, before running back Saquon Barkley ran it in from four yards out early in the fourth quarter. He also ran it in from two yards out with 3:58 left in the game, after IU had taken a 31-28 lead. A Tyler Davis 38-yard field goal followed by a Torrence Brown 9-yard fumble recovery for a touchdown made it a misleading score.

Michigan State opened conference play at 0-6 and destroyed Rutgers, 49-0. They were up 21-0 after one and 35-0 at the half. Rutgers junior quarterback Giovanni Rescigno struggled, completing just 6-of-16 for 40 yards and two picks. Rutgers amassed just 149 total yards, had the ball 24:23 and turned it over twice.

Their defense is actually good against the pass (23rd), allowing 193.2 yards per game.

Michigan State throttled Rutgers 440-149 in total yards and had 20 first downs to the Scarlet Knights\u2019 8.

It would be an upset if Strong does return unless UT plasters Kansas, TCU and then some bowl opponent. But a loss here no question kills Strong&#8217;s chances. Most reports out of the Dallas area are that he must finish with a winning record. All indications so far have been that UT President Greg Fenves and athletic director Mike Perrin want to keep Strong if they can justify progress. \u00a0Strong indicated this week he\u2019s as aware as anyone about his record and status with rumors swirling about his job status since early in the season. \u00a0&#8220;I look at how we\u2019re playing.

His performance marks the 11th straight time he&#8217;s surpassed the century mark, tying Earl Campbell&#8217;s school record for most consecutive 100-yard games. Foreman\u2019s now has 1,613 rushing yards this season. That&#8217;s the sixth-most in UT single season history, six yards shy of Jamaal Charles\u2019 1,619 in 2007. In seven Big 12 Conference games, Foreman now has 196 carries for 1,325 yards and 10 touchdowns. Shane Buechele set career highs in both passing yards (318) and rushing yards (44) in the loss.\u00a0 The Longhorns finished with 536 yards of total offense, the seventh time this season they collected over 500 yards, a new school record.<\/p><\/div>\n<div class='third-quarter'>\n<h3>Jayhawks Have Nowhere To Go But Up<\/h3>\n<p>Not much good to say about Kansas other than the basketball team is really good and has a big game on Tuesday night against No. 1 Duke. KU (1-9, 0-7) won its opener in a blowout over Rhode Island and hasn&#8217;t since. The Jayhawks were competitive last week in a 31-24 home loss to Iowa State. The Cyclones scored on four of their five second-half possessions &#8212; the fifth bleeding the final seconds off the clock. Matthew Wyman&#8217;s 37-yard field goal gave Kansas a 17-10 lead early in the second half. The Jayhawks have lost 23 straight games against FBS opponents, dating to Nov. 8, 2014, when Kansas defeated Iowa State 34-14 at home.<\/p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Carter Stanley got his first start at QB vs. Iowa State and is expected to remain the starter against Texas, KU coach David Beaty said following the loss. Stanley took a couple deep shots downfield as the game went on, but mostly settled for 2-, 3- and 4-yard gains, especially on first down. Stanley did spread the ball around well, finding six different targets, three of which hauled in six or more receptions. Stanley completed 26-of-38 passes for 152 yards &#8212; both career highs &#8212; and a touchdown. The running back tandem of senior Ke&#8217;aun Kinner and sophomore Taylor Martin took much of the pressure away from Stanley as the ground game provided a season-rushing-high 244 of KU&#8217;s 415 yards. Kinner toted 18 times for 152 yards and a score, while Martin chipped in 17 carries for 83 yards and a touchdown.<\/p><\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'>Trends<\/p>\n<p>Texas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Longhorns are 4-1 ATS in their last 5 games following a straight up loss.<\/li>\n<li>Longhorns are 5-2 ATS in their last 7 games following a ATS loss.<\/li>\n<li>Longhorns are 5-2 ATS in their last 7 road games vs. a team with a losing home record.<\/li>\n<li>Over is 6-1 in Longhorns last 7 road games vs. a team with a losing home record.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Kansas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jayhawks are 6-15 ATS in their last 21 games following a straight up loss.<\/li>\n<li>Jayhawks are 5-13 ATS in their last 18 conference games.<\/li>\n<li>Jayhawks are 8-21-1 ATS in their last 30 games following a ATS win.<\/li>\n<li>Over is 5-2 in Jayhawks last 7 games in November.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Saturday&#8217;s game will be the 16th all-time matchup between the Longhorns and Jayhawks.

They had a 9-0 record and were ranked in the top four of the playoff rankings, but then Pittsburgh \u00a0came to town and pulled one of the bigger upsets of the year by beating the Tigers by a 43-42 score on a FG with just six seconds left in the game. Earlier in the year they nearly lost on their home field to NC State, but the Wolfpack missed a FG in the closing seconds that would have won the game. Despite the loss, they are still very much alive for a playoff berth as Michigan and Washington also lost on the same day.

The Tigers have been a very strong offensive team this year as they come in ranked 15th in total yards, 7th in passing, 84th in rushing and 17th in scoring, putting up 38.9 ppg. On defense they have been very solid as well as they come in ranked 14th in yards allowed, 22nd vs the pass, 32nd vs the run and 12th in points allowed, giving up just 18.4 ppg. <\/span><\/div>\n<div class='third-quarter'>\n<h3>Fourth Quarter Collapse Dooms Wake Vs Louisville<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Wake Forest Demon Deacons have had a decent year so far as they are 6-4 overall and 3-3 in the ACC, after going just 3-9 overall and 1-7 in the ACC last year. They are one of the most\u00a0<\/span>improved teams in the nation and have already reached bowl eligibility. They have been led by their defense this year and the Louisville Cardinals found that out for much of the game last week.Wake\u2019s defense clamped down on Lamar Jackson and company and had a 12-0 lead early on and a 12-10 lead heading to the 4th. That\u2019s when it all fell apart as they were outscored 34-0 in the final frame. This is a solid team, but they are also a young team and will learn how to close out games like that in the future.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They did struggle on offense in the game as they could muster just 214 yards of total offense and four FGs. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/blog\/acc\/post\/_\/id\/96410\/john-wolford-comes-full-circle-for-bowl-bound-wake-forest\">John Wolford<\/a> was 13-22 for 141 yards in the game.

Overall this year, the Demon Deacons are 123rd in total offense, 113th in passing 90th in rushing and 118th in scoring, putting up just 20.4 ppg. On defense they have been very solid as they come in ranked 44th in yards allowed, 66th vs the pass, 49th vs the run and 22nd in points allowed, giving up just 21 ppg. \u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'><b>Trends<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Clemson is:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">7-1 ATS in their last eight games after allowing more than 280 yards passing in their previous game<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6-2 ATS in their last eight games following a straight up loss<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Wake Forest is:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3-8 ATS in their last 11 home games vs. a team with a winning road record<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is a tough one to call as I would normally going with the bubble burst theory on Clemson and that means going against them, but they are still very much alive for a playoff spot and they still need to win this game to play in the ACC Title game. If they and the Cardinals finish at 7-1 then they will play in the title game as they own the tiebreaker over the Cardinals. Wake is a solid defensive team, but they have no offense and you saw last week that they can get worn down vs a good Louisville squad.

The Bulls have four in a row over Miami, Washington, Portland, and Utah.<\/p><\/div>\n<div class='second-quarter'>\n<h3>Where&#8217;s Rondo?<\/h3>\n<p>Bulls&#8217; point guard Rajon Rondo sat out Thursday&#8217;s 85-77 win over the Jazz due to\u00a0a sprained left ankle, marking his second straight missed contest.\u00a0Rondo, who sustained the injury\u00a0during Monday&#8217;s practice, has been unable to do much more than participate in some shooting portions of practice. Jerian Grant started in\u00a0his place for a second consecutive outing and scored just six points on 2-for-10 shooting.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, small forward Doug McDermott remains in the NBA&#8217;s concussion protocol and has been ruled out\u00a0for all of the current western road trip. McDermott entered the concussion protocol for the second time in less than two weeks after a hard fall in last Saturday&#8217;s win over the Wizards.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;(I) texted with him [Wednesday]; he was starting to feel a little bit better,&#8221; head\u00a0coach Fred Hoiberg said of McDermott. &#8220;But still not symptom free.&#8221;<\/p><\/div>\n<div class='third-quarter'>\n<h3>Paul looking for offense<\/h3>\n<p>Clippers&#8217; point\u00a0guard Chris Paul will be looking for a bounce-back performance after matching a season low with nine points on 3-of-11 shooting in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.co.uk\/nba\/recap?gameId=400899617\" target=\"_blank\">Wednesday&#8217;s 111-107 loss to Memphis<\/a>. Paul did, however, rack up at least five steals for the fourth time during this 2016-17 campaign.\u00a0J.J. Redick tried to pick up the slack for Paul&#8217;s lack of scoring by turning in a season-high 29 points. Blake Griffin added 25.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It is a lesson,&#8221; Griffin said following the setback. &#8220;Putting ourselves in such a big hole makes late games so intense for every little thing. It messes you up. I think it is good. We love to win them all, but (a loss) will be good for us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sometimes you forget when you win a series of games by a lot, you forget how hard it is to win in this league,&#8221; Redick explained. &#8220;And the other thing is sometimes you get a little comfortable and you forget what makes you good.&#8221;<\/p><\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'><strong>NBA Trends<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>The Chicago Bulls\u00a0are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>5-2 Under in their last seven overall<\/li>\n<li>18-7-1 Under in their last 26 road games<\/li>\n<li>9-2-1 Under in their last 12 road games against teams with winning home records<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Los Angeles Clippers\u00a0are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>20-6 Under in their last 26 home games<\/li>\n<li>7-0 Under in their last seven home games against teams with winning road records<\/li>\n<li>12-5 Under in their last 17 games agains the Eastern\u00a0Conference<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Rondo may be out again for Chicago, which already has McDemott on the sidelines.

Orlando caught a break in the fact that the Pelicans couldn\u2019t score without Anthony Davis in their lineup. The Magic shot just 38.6 percent from the floor while New Orleans shot 36.6 percent in the game.

The Blackhawks lost 4-0 to the Jets on Tuesday, and take on the Flames Friday night, and the Canucks edged the Coyotes by a 3-2 score in overtime in their latest action. Chicago took two of three from Vancouver last season.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='second-quarter'>\n<h3>Blackhawks Shutout for First Time of Season<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The Chicago Blackhawks were shutout for the first time of the season in Tuesday\u2019 nights loss to the Jets as all 27 shots were turned aside. Patrick Kane did manage to put six shots on goal but was denied all six times by Connor Hellebuyck. Kane is having another terrific season, scoring six goals with 12 assists, ranking him sixth in the NHL in points.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhl.com\/player\/marian-hossa-8466148\" target=\"_blank\">Marian Hossa <\/a>has been hot, scoring four goals with two assists over his last four games heading into Friday\u2019s action. The 18-year veteran still possesses great speed down the wing, netting a team-high nine goals with six assists on the season on an average of over 18 minutes of ice time per game. One area Chicago needs to work on is their penalty kill, which is currently ranked 30th in the NHL, killing off only 67.3% of their penalties. They have shown improvement, allowing only two power play goals over their last eight games.\u00a0<\/span>The Blackhawks are a very dangerous team offensively, scoring an average of 3.1 goals per game, ranking them seventh in the NHL.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Chicago will be going with backup goaltender Scott Darling between the pipes in this contest. Darling has seen action in five games, and has won all three starts, but owns a subpar 2.98 GAA with a .907 save percentage. The Chicago is conceding an average of 2.5 goals per game, placing them 10th overall.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='third-quarter'>\n<h3>Canucks Erase Two Goal Deficit in Win Over Coyotes<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Vancouver Canucks rallied from a two-goal deficit and defeated the Arizona Coyotes by a 3-2 score in overtime Thursday night. Ben Hutton was the overtime hero, scoring his second goal of the season on a penalty shot on a nifty deke. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhl.com\/player\/daniel-sedin-8467875\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Sedin<\/a> led the way for the Canucks scoring one goal and added an assist on 20 minutes of ice time. Sedin has been very consistent, currently riding a seven game point streak, collecting eight points in that span, and now leads his team in points with six goals and seven assists. Brandon Sutter has finally broken out of his slump by scoring three goals over his last three games, and now has just four goals with six assists on the season. The Canucks do not have a whole lot of secondary scoring an need Sutter to produce. Vancouver has had trouble scoring goals all season, averaging only 2.1 goals per game, placing them down at 29th overall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Vancouver could be going with Jacob Markstrom in net again as Ryan Miller missed Thursday&#8217;s game with the flu. Markstrom has been better than Miller this season, posting a 5-3-1 record, but owns a weak 2.71 GAA, with a .900 save percentage. The Canucks have been shaky defensively, allowing an average of 3.1 goals per game, placing them 25th overall.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'><strong>Trends:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Chicago Blackhawks are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>over is 4-0-1 in their last 5 games in the second game of a back-to-back stretch.<\/li>\n<li>over is 4-1 in their last 5 Saturday games.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The Vancouver Canucks are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>over is 3-0-1 in their last 4 home games.<\/li>\n<li>over is 5-1-1 in their last 7 games overall.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I am taking the over in this contest. Vancouver has been surrendering a ton of goals, conceding an average of 4.14 goals per game over their last six games and they are in trouble going against the Blackhawks ferocious offense who should fill net the net in this one. Also, Chicago is going with backup Scott Darling in goal, and he has allowed three or more goals in each of his three starts so I am counting on a few goals from the Canucks as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Pick: Over<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n","promo":"Patrick Kane and the Chicago Blackhawks will square off with the Vancouver Canucks Saturday night from Rogers Arena.","thumb":"https:\/\/misc-rnnukmcdu8mee.netdna-ssl.com\/san\/uploads\/2016\/11\/USATSI_9669946-300x225.jpg","full_image":"https:\/\/misc-rnnukmcdu8mee.netdna-ssl.com\/san\/uploads\/2016\/11\/USATSI_9669946-400x300.jpg","writer":"13","published":"2016-11-18T18:33:01-05:00","modified":"2016-11-18T18:33:01-05:00"},{"game_id":"229710","slug":"\/games\/nhl\/11-19-2016\/colorado-avalanche-vs-minnesota-wild-111916-prediction\/","title":"Colorado Avalanche vs. Minnesota Wild, 11\/19\/16 - Prediction","content":"<div class='first-quarter'>Colorado Avalanche at Minnesota Wild<\/p>\n<p>When\/Where: Saturday, 8 p.m. ET, Xcel Energy Center<\/p>\n<p>Moneylines: TBA; total: 5<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/team\/_\/name\/col\/colorado-avalanche\">Colorado Avalanche<\/a> could be missing two of their best forwards on Saturday night when the Avs, the last-place team in the Central, visits division rival Minnesota.

They come off a 3-2 loss in Dallas on Thursday to start a three-game road trip. The Stars jumped on that Avs for three-first period goals. Colorado outshot Dallas 30-16 in the last 40 minutes, but Stars netminder Lehtonen camp up big while getting 28 of his 34 saves. MacKinnon scored a short-handed goal and added an assist on Mikhail Grigorenko&#8217;s third-period goal. Colorado center Nathan MacKinnon was arguably the best player on the ice and the game&#8217;s No. 2 star. MacKinnon scored a short-handed goal and added an assist on Mikhail Grigorenko&#8217;s third-period goal. Lehtonen also stopped MacKinnon on a breakaway midway through the second period and again on a rebound with 10 minutes left in the game.<\/p>\n<p>Semyon Varlamov allowed three goals on 22 shots. Those three were on the first six shots he saw but then Varlamov settled down. Varlamov has a 4-8-0 record with a 3.01 goals-against-average and a .901 save percentage. A.J. Greer got his first NHL point Thursday night. He assisted on Grigorenko&#8217;s goal. Greer got to play with MacKinnon and Andreas Martinsen because of injuries to Matt Duchene and Gabriel Landeskog. Duchene has a concussion and probably misses another game. He was hurt Nov. 11 Landeskog is questionable with a lower-body injury but nearly played Thursday.<\/p><\/div>\n<div class='third-quarter'>\n<h3>Wild Complete Homestand<\/h3>\n<p>Minnesota has had a pair of 1-0 results on a three-game homestand, losing by that score to Calgary on Tuesday and then beating Boston on Thursday. Mikael Granlund scored with 44.5 seconds left, Devan Dubnyk stopped 25 shots for his league-leading fourth shutout. Dubnyk has a 7-5-1 record with a 1.48 goals-against-average and a .952 save percentage this season. Granlund took a pass from Jonas Brodin circled below the end line and came out to the right of Tuukka Rask. His centering pass went off Adam McQuaid then off Rask and into the Boston net. Granlund has four goals and five assists in 16 games this season. He&#8217;s on pace to hit the 20-goal mark for the first time in his career.<\/p>\n<p>Dubnyk has allowed nine goals over his past nine games, and Minnesota has given up a NHL-low 29 goals this season. In those nine games, Dubnyk has five wins. Including Thursday, the Wild have scored eight goals in the past six games Dubnyk has started. &#8220;It&#8217;s got to be tough on our goalies. We&#8217;re not scoring a lot of goals,&#8221; said Wild coach Bruce Boudreau. &#8220;Mind you, we&#8217;re trying to score. I mean, but they&#8217;ve been so good. You keep waiting for it, but hopefully we don&#8217;t exhaust them out in practice and they can stay mentally into the games.&#8221;<\/p><\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'>Trends<\/p>\n<p>Colorado:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avalanche are 2-5 in their last 7 games playing on 1 days rest.<\/li>\n<li>Avalanche are 5-16 in their last 21 vs. Central.<\/li>\n<li>Avalanche are 1-4 in their last 5 road games.<\/li>\n<li>Avalanche are 2-12 in their last 14 when their opponent scores 2 goals or less in their previous game.<\/li>\n<li>Under is 4-0 in Avalanche last 4 vs. a team with a winning record.<\/li>\n<li>Under is 4-1-1 in Avalanche last 6 games playing on 1 days rest.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Minnesota:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wild are 5-2 in their last 7 home games.<\/li>\n<li>Under is 6-0-1 in Wild last 7 games following a win.<\/li>\n<li>Under is 5-0 in Wild last 5 home games.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I have a feeling this game&#8217;s score will be quite similar to Nov. 5 when Minnesota lost 1-0 at Colorado, although I like the Wild here because of the Avalanche&#8217;s injuries.

The Predators took down the Senators by a 5-1 score on Thursday night, and the Blues defeated the Sharks by a 3-2 score in their latest action. The Predators defeated the Blues by a 3-1 score last month behind a two goal performance from Calle Jarnkrok. Pekka Rinne stopped 23 of 24 shots in the victory.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='second-quarter'>\n<h3>Predators Crush Senators in Five Goal Outburst<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Nashville Predators fired a barrage of shots on net and were rewarded with a 5-1 road win over the Senators Thursday night, and have now won four out of their last five games. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhl.com\/player\/james-neal-8471707\" target=\"_blank\">James Neal<\/a> continued his hot play after a slow start to the season, scoring another goal in the win. The 29-year old left winger has now scored seven goals over his last six games, increasing his total to a team-leading eight goals with four assists on the season. P.K. Subban busted out of a three-game pointless drought with two assists and finished with a plus two rating. As of now the Canadiens are benefiting a bit more from the Weber\/Subban trade, as Weber has notched 13 points with a plus 16 rating compared to 10 points and a minus five rating from Subban. The Predators scoring has been much more productive as of late, and are now scoring an average of 2.9 goals per game, ranking them 10th in the NHL.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Predators will likely go with Pekka Rinne in net in this one. Rinne has been tremendous this month after a shaky October, winning four consecutive games, posting a dazzling 2.04 GAA with a .933 save percentage on the season. Nashville has been mediocre defensively, conceding an average of 2.6 goals per game, placing them 15th in the NHL.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='third-quarter'>\n<h3>Blues Edge Sharks in Big Game from Schwartz<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The St. Louis Blues edged the San Jose Sharks by a 3-2 score on Thursday night, collecting their second straight win. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhl.com\/player\/jaden-schwartz-8475768\" target=\"_blank\">Jaden Schwartz<\/a> was the game\u2019s first star, scoring two goals in the win. Schwartz has been on a tear, scoring five goals over his last six games after scoring only one goal through his first eight games. The Blues penalty kill was outstanding in the win, killing all six of the Sharks power plays. The St. Louis penally kill has been terrific all season, killing off 89.7% of their penalties good for first in the entire NHL. The 24-year old left winger now has six goals with two assists on the season. Another player to watch for is Vladimir Tarasenko who has been red hot, collecting nine points over his last six games played. The The star right winger now has six goals with 12 assists on the season, tying him for sixth in NHL scoring with 18 points. St. Louis has not been scoring a whole lot of goals, averaging 2.4 goals per game, placing them 21st overall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">St. Louis will likely give the start in net to Jake Allen. The young goaltender has had a few rough games this month but overall he has been solid, winning two straight starts, and now owns a 7-3-3 record with a 2.45 GAA and a .904 save percentage on the year. The Blues are now allowing an average of 2.7 goals per game placing them 17th overall.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'><strong>Trends:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Nashville Predators are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>4-0 in their last 4 games when their opponent allows two or fewer goals in their previous game.<\/li>\n<li>4-1 in their last five games overall.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The St. Louis Blues are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>No Key Trends<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I am going with the Predators in this contest. Nashville is finally playing like the team everyone expected. and when they are playing well they are very tough to beat. Rinne has been incredible in net, allowing a total of only three goals over his last four games and the Blues are a lower scoring team as it is. Nashville\u2019s goal scoring has come alive as of late, scoring three or more goals in four out of their last five games, so I am confident they can find the back of the net in this one.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Pick: Nashville Predators +113<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n","promo":"James Neal and the Nashville Predators will head on the road to take on Vladimir Tarasenko and the St. Louis Blues Saturday night from the Scottrade Center.","thumb":"https:\/\/misc-rnnukmcdu8mee.netdna-ssl.com\/san\/uploads\/2016\/11\/USATSI_9680601-300x225.jpg","full_image":"https:\/\/misc-rnnukmcdu8mee.netdna-ssl.com\/san\/uploads\/2016\/11\/USATSI_9680601-451x300.jpg","writer":"13","published":"2016-11-18T17:31:15-05:00","modified":"2016-11-19T05:05:53-05:00"},{"game_id":"229707","slug":"\/games\/nhl\/11-19-2016\/pittsburgh-penguins-vs-buffalo-sabres-111916-prediction\/","title":"Pittsburgh Penguins vs. Buffalo Sabres, 11\/19\/16 - Prediction","content":"<div class='first-quarter'><b>Pittsburgh Penguins (10-4-2 SU, 6-10 PL, 8-4-4 O\/U) vs Buffalo Sabres (5-8-2-2 SU, 9-8 PL, 4-11-2 O\/U)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>When:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> 7:00 PM ET, Saturday, November 19, 2016<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Where:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> KeyBank Center in Buffalo, New York<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Lines:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Pittsburgh -156\/ Buffalo +141 <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Total:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> 5<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Saturday evening NHL Hockey action and the Pittsburgh Penguins will head to western New York to battle it out with the Buffalo Sabres at KeyBank Center in Buffalo.

This was not what they were expecting in what was a major early season showdown. Matt Murray got the start in the game, but exited early after allowing just two goals. He left the game due to concussion protocol and was actually cleared to return to the Ice in that game, but they Pens went with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/sports\/penguins-blog\/2016\/11\/18\/Pregame-Penguins-at-Islanders-7-p-m\/stories\/201611180209\">Marc-Andre Fleury<\/a> the rest of the way. He allowed the final five goals in the game, but getting the loss was Murray, which was his 1st loss of the year. Getting the call in this one will be Fleury, who is 6-5 with a 3.32 GAA on the year, including 1-3 with a 4.79 GAA on the road, while vs the Sabres in his career he has gone 19-7 with a 2.19 GAA. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Penguins have been a solid offensive team this year, but they were able to score just the one goal on Washington the other night. That goal was scored by Phil Kessel, which was his 4th of the year. Pittsburgh comes in ranked 8th in the league in scoring at 2.94 gpg, while also ranking 4th in shots taken (31.9 spg) and 5th in power play conversions, converting on 23.6% of their chances. At the defensive end of the ice they have been average as they come in ranked 21st in goals allowed, giving up 2.88 gpg, while also ranking 30th in shots allowed (34.0) and 21st in penalty kill, allowing teams to convert on 19.0% of their chances.<\/span><\/div>\n<div class='third-quarter'>\n<h3>Offense Continues To Struggle For The Sabres<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Buffalo Sabres are having a very hard time finding the back of the net right now as they come in having scored two goals or less in each of their last nine games. That is just horrible offense these days. They come in off a 4-1 home loss to the Lightning and have now scored a total of 11 goals in their last nine games. Scoring their lone goal in the loss was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbssports.com\/fantasy\/hockey\/news\/sabres-cody-franson-scores-on-power-play-for-first-goal-of-2016-17\/\">Cody Franson<\/a>, which was his 1st goal of the year. This is a team that is lacking offensive punch and have been led by Matt Moulson, who has six goals so far, while 2nd on the team is Kyle Okposo, who has five so far. Ryan O\u2019Reilly has four and is the only other player on the team with more than three goals. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Taking the loss vs the Lightning was Robin Lehner, who is 4-9 with a 2.53 GAA on the year, including 0-4 with a 2.74 GAA here at home, while vs the Penguins in his career he has gone 1-2 with a 2.75 GAA. Buffalo enters this game ranked 30th in the league in scoring at 1.82 gpg, while also ranking 23rd in shots taken (28.7 spg) and 10th in power play conversions, converting on 20.8% of their chances. At the defensive end of the ice they have been decent as they rank 13th in goals allowed, giving up 2.53 gpg, while also ranking 24th in shots allowed (32.1) and 22nd in penalty kill, allowing teams to convert on 19.7% of their chances. <\/span><\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'><b>Trends<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Pittsburgh is:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">40-17 in their last 57 vs. the Eastern Conference<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">20-6 in their last 26 vs. a team with a losing record<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Buffalo is:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">21-44 in their last 65 vs. the Metropolitan<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">21-48 in their last 69 home games<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Just can\u2019t back the Sabres here, even though they are playing with a days rest, while the Penguins are on no rest. Pittsburgh has been the far more consistent team, while the Sabres are really struggling on offense as they have scored a total of 11 goals in their last nine games. They have scored two goals or less in all of those games. Pittsburgh has a clear edge on offense and in the crease.

The latter performance came just about out of nowhere, as Florida had previously ended the Canadiens&#8217; unbeaten run at home (the Habs were 10-0-0 at home this season prior to their setback agaunst Florida). That gave the Panthers back-to-back victories for the first time in this 2016-17 campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Florida acquired center Michael Sgarbossa from Anaheim for forward Logan Shaw on Wednesday.

Now that percentage is even better. The Senators have thwarted\u00a031 consecutive penalties over their last 12\u00a0contests after going a perfect 4-for-4 in that department during Tuesday&#8217;s shootout win over the Flyers and again against Nashville on Thursday even though they lost 5-1.<\/p>\n<p>On the other end of the ice, center Kyle Turris has scored in two of the last three outings\u00a0to increase his team-leading total to eight, which is five shy of the amount he registered in 57 games\u00a0last season.<\/p><\/div>\n<div class='fourth-quarter'><strong>NHL Trends<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>The Florida Panthers\u00a0are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>5-2-2 Under in their last nine games when their opponent scores no more than two goals in its previous outing<\/li>\n<li>7-3 Under in their last 10 games against Ottawa<\/li>\n<li>5-2 Under in their last 10 games at Ottawa<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Ottawa Senators\u00a0are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>9-1 Under in their last 10 overall<\/li>\n<li>6-1 Under in their last seven home\u00a0games<\/li>\n<li>5-0 Under in their last five games against the Eastern Conference<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Senators are mored in a current 11-game streak of being limited to fewer than three goals prior to a shootout. Ottawa forward\u00a0Mark Stone has netted only three goals in 15 games this season. Fortunately for the home team, its defense against the penalty kill has been absolutely awesome of late. The under is 9-1 in the Senators&#8217; last 10 overall, 6-1 in their last seven at home, 5-0 in their last five against the Eastern Conference, and 12-3-1 in their last 16 against losing opponents.
