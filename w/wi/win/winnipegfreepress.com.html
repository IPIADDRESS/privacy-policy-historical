It was important to point out those facts, to tell those stories, and over the past few weeks, in particular, the Free Press revealed some of the best of them.\nNo doubt a good many serious outlets throughout the country did likewise, as is befitting the run-up to a truly global competition.\nIncredibly, the feel-good factor surrounding this World Cup (notwithstanding the occasional pocket of bitterness that remains regarding the artificial surfaces) not only survived the latest revelations of FIFA scandal that threatened to diminish it, but thrived in spite of it.\nAnd what we have as a result is a month of soccer celebration of the purest sort possible in a cynical industry &mdash; a sort of righteous foil to the evil forces that all too often detract from those heartening stories we see on the pitch, experience from the sidelines and feel in our fibres.\nSoccer really does bring us together, often in a figurative sense but, every now and then, in a literal one as well.\nIt is right now &mdash; today, here &mdash; bringing the world to our neighbourhoods and making us &mdash; Canadians generally and Winnipeggers specifically &mdash; at once its safeguard and emissary.\nThe moment has arrived. Here we are.\n\n | World Cup Winnipeg |  As of this afternoon, our World Cup build-up period is over. We have games to talk about.\nFirst up at Investors Group Field is the 3 p.m. contest between 2003 runners-up Sweden and reigning African champions Nigeria. At the 2007 tournament in China they played to a 1-1 draw, although the European giants have outscored the Super Falcons 6-2 in their six previous matches.\nNigeria, however, are easily the most competitive African outfit at this event, and in 20-year-old attacker Asisat Oshoala have the BBC&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s Footballer of the Year for 2015 among the ranks.\nLast August Nigeria&rsquo;s under-20 side took their German counterparts to extra time in the final of that age category&rsquo;s World Cup &mdash; also held in Canada &mdash; and Oshoala, who plays her club soccer at Liverpool Ladies, finished as top scorer.\nShe&rsquo;ll have to be in top form to help her side contend with a Sweden team that includes the likes of Lotta Schelin and Nilla Fischer, both of whom were short-listed for last year&rsquo;s FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Player of the Year award.\nThe lone American on the short list was Abby Wambach, who claimed the prize in 2012. The 35-year-old striker and the United States&rsquo; all-time leading goalscorer will kick off what will surely be her final World Cup at 6:30 p.m. against Australia.\nOpposite Wambach will be Australia captain Lisa De Vanna, whose 2013 bicycle-kick for Sky Blue FC against the Boston Breakers earned her a FIFA Puskas Award nomination for best goal of the year.\nShe&rsquo;ll be making her 100th appearance for The Matildas this evening, and the tenacity so often displayed by she and her teammates will have a lot to do with how the Group D underdogs fare against the section&rsquo;s heavyweights.\nAnother variable in the match will be the availability of United States attacker Alex Morgan, who had been idle since April with a knee injury before completing a full training session on Saturday.\nShe may not start against Australia but could well come off the bench in the second half.\n\n | Canadian trail","last_updated":"2015-06-08T03:19:00.000Z","full_image_width":1000,"full_image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/1000*713/150607_FIFA_AUSTRALIA_09_19395229.JPG"},{"image_title":"","media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","image":"","image_caption":"","image_credit":"","cost":"27","image_dimensions":"","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/Homeowner-stabbed-during-garage-robbery-306427081.html","section":"Local ","id":306427081,"author":"Jessica Botelho-Urbanski","full_image_dimensions":"","short_title":"","title":"Homeowner stabbed during garage robbery","source":"wfp-circle","publish_time":"2015-06-07T23:07:00.000Z","image_type":"noimage","teaser":"A Free Press carrier just home from work was the victim of a violent robbery early Sunday morning. He suffered at least 10 stab wounds and is recovering in hospital, his wife said.\n\nGord Lengyel, 44, lives in the 1300 block of Pritchard Avenue and around 4:00 a.m., he came home to find two young men in the middle of robbing his garage.\n\nLengyel&rsquo;s wife, Annie, said her husband noticed the front and back gates to their yard were open and the lock to the garage was removed.\n\nAfter closing the gates, he placed what he thought was a sturdy, metal bike lock on the garage. He planned to put a new lock on later Sunday, but thought the bike lock would be secure in the meantime.  &ldquo;Bolt cutters won&rsquo;t cut through that,&rdquo; Annie Lengyel remembered him saying.\n\nAbout five minutes after the fact, the bike lock had been ripped off the door and the garage&rsquo;s security alarm was ringing, Annie said.\n\nGord went outside to see what was happening, armed with a flashlight.\n\n&ldquo;He did what anybody would do: go see who the heck is in your garage,&rdquo; Annie said.\n\nGord interrupted two men dressed in dark clothing, picking through the garage.\n\n&ldquo;Normally people under those circumstances, they run,&rdquo; Annie said of the thieves. &ldquo;These guys didn&rsquo;t run, they actually charged at him.&rdquo;\n\nAnnie heard the commotion and came outside. It appeared one robber had already fled the scene, she said.\n\n&ldquo;By the time I got to the back door to see what he was doing outside, I only saw the one guy and it looked like he was hitting him,&rdquo; Annie said.\n\nOnce she hollered at the man to stop, he jumped the fence to flee. He came back though, having dropped an item, then picked it up and jumped the fence again, she said.\n\nAnnie helped her husband walk back inside the house and called 911.\n\n&ldquo;They&rsquo;re pretty ballsy to come back within five minutes,&rdquo; Annie said of the robbers. &ldquo;I figure they knew what they were doing. They took everything with them that would have held fingerprints.&rdquo;\n\nAnnie said she doesn&rsquo;t know if the would-be thieves made off with anything, but that spare tools and an old, broken Ski-doo are the only things stored in their garage.\n\nPolice are still looking for the suspects and ask anyone with information to call investigators at 204-986-2848 or Crime Stoppers at 204-786-8477.\n\nAnnie said she didn&rsquo;t get a very good look at the robber, but saw he had light skin, was wearing a dark hoodie and either jeans or sweatpants.\n\nGord is recovering in hospital in stable condition with 10 to 11 stab wounds. He had 23 staples put in and still needs stitches, Annie said.\n\nAnnie is waiting to hear from doctors late Sunday whether he will require surgery, too.\n\n&ldquo;That was the first time since we&rsquo;ve lived here that anything ever happened and we&rsquo;ve been here seven or eight years,&rdquo; Annie said. &ldquo;It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense what they were after because we don&rsquo;t have anything.&rdquo;\n\njessica.botelho-urbanski@freepress.mb.ca","path":"/local","dimensions":"","last_updated":"2015-06-07T23:20:05.000Z","full_image":"","related_items":[]},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","image_height":432,"id":306414001,"author":"Mark Kennedy, The Associated Press","title":"'Oh What a Night'  -  'Fun Home' and 'Curious Incident'  come away big winners at Tony Awards","image_type":"normal","image_width":640,"path":"/arts-and-life/entertainment/arts","dimensions":"640x432","full_image_height":439,"related_items":[],"image_title":"NYAH353-67_2015_225731_high","image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/639*432/NYAH353-67_2015_225731_high.jpg","image_caption":"Kristin Caskey, center, along with cast and crew accepts the award for best musical for \u201cFun Home\u201dat the 69th annual Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall on Sunday, June 7, 2015, in New York.

What&rsquo;s bone healing at? Three to six (weeks)? But who knows?  Everyone heals differently.&rdquo;\nWhile  Stoudermire brought an utterly unique skill set to the Bombers, O&rsquo;Shea  downplayed the significance of his absence from the club&rsquo;s lineup. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we have a lot of depth in training camp. This year,  we have a great deal of depth here. We will not only survive, we&rsquo;ll  thrive through these situations.\n&ldquo;The next guy up is going to want to prove something.&rdquo;\nStoudermire  was a special teams player of the week for the Bombers last year and he  led the CFL in combined special teams yards per game, averaging 171 yards per game in seven games for Winnipeg in 2014.\nHe was rewarded with a new contract in the off-season that locked him down as a Bomber through 2017.\nEven  before Stoudermire was hurt, the Bombers had been auditioning several  other kick returners at this year&rsquo;s camp, including speedsters receiver Jhomo Gordon and running back Carlos Anderson.\nThe  news of Stoudermire&rsquo;s injury came on the same day the Bombers held  their final full practice before travelling to Toronto, where they will take on the Argos at Varsity Stadium Tuesday night in the  first pre-season game of the 2015 CFL season for both teams.\nO&rsquo;Shea  revealed he will take four quarterbacks with him to Toronto and all  will get to play against the Argos &mdash; Drew Willy, Brian Brohm, Robert Marve and Josh Portis. The only QB not making the trip this week  is former U of M Bisons pivot Jordan Yantz, O&rsquo;Shea said.\nWilly  said he&rsquo;s excited to finally get some game action. &ldquo;I think everyone&rsquo;s  ready for a game after the first week of pre-season. Everyone&rsquo;s just ready to play someone else.&rdquo;\nWhile  Willy&rsquo;s position as the Bombers starting QB this season is already set,  other Bombers players will be trying to win starting jobs in Toronto, including offensive lineman Matthias Goossen.\nThe  Bombers drafted Goossen third overall in the 2014 CFL draft, believing  he was ready to be a starter in the CFL. While Goossen did start a couple games in injury relief last season, his progress has been  slower than the team&rsquo;s front office had originally hoped.\nAnd  Goossen&rsquo;s hardly a lock for a starting job this season, either. The  Bombers went out in the off-season and signed Dominic Picard as their new centre, a position Goossen is most comfortable playing. And  they also drafted Sukh Chungh second overall in last month&rsquo;s CFL draft  and have been giving Chungh a long hard look at training camp at right  guard, the other position Goossen has some experience playing.\nPut  it altogether and Goossen needs to make an impression in Toronto.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to continue to compete &mdash; that&rsquo;s all I can do right now. You can&rsquo;t worry about other people coming in, you can&rsquo;t worry about  other people being signed,&rdquo; said Goossen, who got married during the  off-season.\n&ldquo;I can only do what I can do and just work my hardest wherever they put me.&rdquo;\nO&rsquo;Shea  said Goossen grew up in more ways than one during the off-season. &ldquo;He  seems more mature. He&rsquo;s more comfortable in his role,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Shea. &ldquo;Not only physically does he look more mature, but he just seems  more focussed and ready to go.&rdquo;\nSICK BAY &mdash; Stoudermire was one of at least a dozen Bombers players who continued  to miss practice on Sunday due to an assortment of injuries. Offensive lineman Chris Greaves, who missed practice on  Saturday with an illness, was the only notable player to return to the  practice field Sunday.\npaul.wiecek@freepress.mb.ca\nTwitter: @PaulWiecek","last_updated":"2015-06-07T23:56:00.000Z","full_image_width":1000,"full_image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/1000*633/150601_BOMBERS_0321_19355635.JPG"},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","image_height":480,"id":306423391,"author":"Melissa Martin","title":"Goalkeeper's 2014 arrest not concerning to team, U.S. coach says","image_type":"normal","image_width":454,"path":"/sports/soccer","dimensions":"454x480","full_image_height":1024,"related_items":[],"image_title":"150603 fifa usa013.JPG","image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/453*480/150603_FIFA_USA013_19368051.JPG","image_caption":"SPORTS - Team USA goalkeeper Hope Solo practises with the FIFA women's team at the Winnipeg Soccer Complex June 3.

That, in a nutshell, is how the Truth  and Reconciliation Commission sums up the effects of more than a century of racist, colonial laws and policies on aboriginal people.\nAnd  after repeated reports, including expensive, extensive commissions and  inquiries, on the flood of aboriginal people into jails, the TRC&rsquo;s  executive summary calls for that gross overrepresentation to be reversed within the decade.\nThat&rsquo;s  a tall order for the country, but it is especially so for Manitoba and  Saskatchewan, where jails or remand centres are overwhelmingly filled  with aboriginal people. Looking at the statistics, one would wonder if it is possible.\nIn  2010/11, 27 per cent of inmates in provincial, territorial and federal  custody were aboriginal; in Manitoba that number is 70 per cent and in  Saskatchewan, 78 per cent. (In Manitoba, aboriginal people make up 12 per cent of the population; in Canada, four  per cent.)\nBut  Manitoba throws many more people, generally, and specifically  aboriginal people into custody, than does Saskatchewan. And, it has the  highest rate of incarceration among the provinces, according to Statistics Canada&rsquo;s 2010/11 survey.\nOutside  of reserves, there is no place with higher concentrations of aboriginal  people in these two western provinces. Can there be a starker metaphor  for Canada&rsquo;s painful, dysfunctional relationship with its original people?\nThere  is ample distrust among aboriginal people for Canadian institutions,  and law enforcement, courts and corrections rank right up there on the  list. Underscoring that, the TRC noted so few of the sexual predators who preyed on young children in residential  schools were ever brought to justice. Further, an RCMP investigation of  such allegations in British Columbia in 1993 was &ldquo;compromised&rdquo; and  &ldquo;adversely influenced&rdquo; by the federal government, which confiscated the files in order to protect itself in civil suits.\nMore  recently, the Harper government&rsquo;s tough-on-crime agenda has come at a  higher cost for aboriginal people &mdash; mandatory minimum sentences and  restrictions on conditional-release sentences only fuels the flow to prisons, the TRC notes. \nThe  TRC calls for exemptions, based on individual circumstances, to the  mandatory minimum jail terms. It also repeats the call made almost 20  years ago by Manitoba&rsquo;s Aboriginal Justice Inquiry to give First Nations communities control of justice, with traditional  courts and reconciliation programs.\nBut  cutting the rate of incarceration, it points out, will require  relieving poverty, addictions, family breakdown and violence in  aboriginal homes and communities. \nThat  is long-term work. Manitoba, however, can take immediate steps to slow  the flow. Aboriginal offenders are more likely to land back in jail  after release than non-aboriginal people. Among the reasons is judges, often at the request of Crown attorneys,  attach conditions such as abstention from alcohol or drugs to release  orders. That merely sets people up for failure when there is a dearth of  places to get help for addictions.\nTraditional  justice systems can work, but they must be done with due care for the  victims. Community reconciliation programs must first keep the victim  safe, which has not always been the case in Manitoba.\nFurther,  one effect of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s Gladue decision, which imposed upon  judges the obligation to take an aboriginal person&rsquo;s background into  consideration in sentencing, was victims of domestic violence saw their abusers quickly released. That was seen  as a re-victimization of those hurt hardest by the cascading effects of  racist, paternalistic laws.\nCourts  and prisons are catching the multi-generational blowback of successive  and failed attempts to turn &ldquo;Indians&rdquo; into white people. Emptying jails  will require real justice &mdash; improving the social conditions that continue to damage First Nations people.","last_updated":"2015-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","full_image_width":1000,"full_image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/1000*562/RESIDENTIAL_SCHOOLS_20150603_19367695.JPG"},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","image_height":480,"id":306428251,"author":"Neil Davidson, The Canadian Press","title":"Officials hope women don't follow men's lead when it comes to soccer misbehaviour","image_type":"normal","image_width":327,"path":"/sports/soccer","dimensions":"327x480","full_image_height":649,"related_items":[],"image_title":"OTTK122276678_high","image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/326*480/OTTK122276678_high.jpg","image_caption":"Referee Carol Anne Chenard referees a match between Germany and Cote d'Ivoire's during FIFA Women's World Cup soccer action in Ottawa on Sunday, June 7, 2015.

In October, a group of 84 women soccer players from 13 countries sued FIFA for forcing them to play on turf in the Women&rsquo;s World Cup, which kicks off Saturday in Edmonton. Compared to grass, turf is especially rough on the skin, resulting in severe cuts and bruises and a higher rate of certain types of injuries. The fear of direct contact with turf causes players, both men and women, to adjust their style of play, executing fewer slide tackles and shorter passes and resulting in a much more cautious game. | Moreover, no major men&rsquo;s tournament &mdash; including the World Cup and Champions League final &mdash; has ever been held exclusively on turf. FIFA has indicated that the men could play on turf &ldquo;sooner rather than later,&rdquo; but as of now, it seems content to experiment on the women&rsquo;s game first. | Ultimately, FIFA did what FIFA does: It bullied its opponents. The women dropped their lawsuit in January after several countries&rsquo; federations threatened some players with suspensions, while FIFA used the bluster of its team of top- dollar lawyers to delay court proceedings.","last_updated":"2015-06-06T19:00:00.000Z","full_image_width":704,"full_image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/150529-_FIFA_01_19338329.JPG"},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","image_height":432,"id":306237881,"author":"Carol Sanders","title":"Welcome wows Nigerians","image_type":"normal","image_width":578,"path":"/sports/soccer","dimensions":"578x432","full_image_height":748,"related_items":[{"title":"Team USA all business before Cup","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/soccer/team-usa-all-business-before-cup-306094931.html"},{"title":"Aussies cheered upon arrival","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/soccer/aussies-cheered-upon-arrival-306238121.html"},{"title":"Swedes surprised by noisy reception","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/soccer/swedes-surprised-by-noisy-reception-306094861.html"}],"image_title":"6830378","image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/577*432/6830378.jpg","image_caption":"A Nigerian player signs autographs for fans Thursday at the airport.","image_credit":"","image_dimensions":"578x432","cost":"27","section":"Soccer","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/soccer/welcome-wows-nigerians-306237881.html","short_title":"","full_image_dimensions":"1000x748","publish_time":"2015-06-06T07:06:57.000Z","source":"wfp-circle","teaser":"The Nigerian community in Winnipeg rolled out the red carpet -- and the drums, a saxophone, singers, dancers and a nun -- to welcome the national women's soccer team from Nigeria at the airport. | &quot;I wasn't expecting this,&quot; an awestruck defender Osinachi Ohale said over the celebratory trilling and singing from the expat Nigerian crowd.

With all due respect to the Rheostatics' contributions to Whale Music, it makes a world of difference. | As the creative musical force behind the Beach Boys, Wilson was, in the late '60s, in imminent danger of becoming a golden-oldies has-been. He was keenly aware the band's musical milieu of cars, girls and surfing was merely a marketing strategy. After being driven into a devastating anxiety attack while on tour, Wilson takes a leave from the touring iteration of the band to work on new songs in the studio. He finds himself especially challenged by the Beatles (the Rubber Soul album in particular) to expand the parameters of pop.","last_updated":"2015-06-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_image_width":1000,"full_image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/1000*666/05D1-71519-LM_04130.jpg"},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","image_height":432,"id":306238351,"author":"Scott Billeck","title":"Powerhouse Heald has big dreams","image_type":"normal","image_width":648,"path":"/sports/amateur","dimensions":"648x432","full_image_height":667,"related_items":[],"image_title":"6830188","image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/648*432/6830188.jpg","image_caption":"BORIS MINKEVICH / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS\rTaylor Heald will be in Saturday�s junior varsity girls shot put final after qualifying with a throw of 12.06 metres Thursday.","image_credit":"","image_dimensions":"648x432","cost":"27","section":"Amateur","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/amateur/powerhouse-heald-has-big-dreams-306238351.html","short_title":"","full_image_dimensions":"1000x667","publish_time":"2015-06-06T07:07:47.000Z","source":"wfp-circle","teaser":"Taylor HEALD seems to have a touch even King Midas would be jealous of. | At 15, Heald is already a provincial champion in shot put and added a national title on her last throw in 2014.

The province&rsquo;s chief coroner said  the double amputee may have been sitting dead in his wheelchair as long  as seven hours before he was discovered.","last_updated":"2014-12-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_image_width":1000,"full_image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/1000*649/140117-_HSC_03_172528101.jpg"},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","image_height":480,"id":304734511,"author":"Patrick Blennerhassett","title":"Getting pumped and confused","image_type":"normal","image_width":320,"path":"/special/long-reads","dimensions":"320x480","full_image_height":1499,"related_items":[],"image_title":"Creatine Freak","image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/320*480/150504_SUPPLEMENT_11_191976.jpg","image_caption":"Creatine Freak workout supplements.","image_credit":"TREVOR HAGAN / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS","image_dimensions":"320x480","cost":"27","section":"Long Reads","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/special/long-reads/Getting-pumped-and-confused-304734511.html","short_title":"Bodybuilders beware: supplements a 'Wild West'","full_image_dimensions":"1000x1499","publish_time":"2015-05-23T01:00:00.000Z","source":"wfp-circle","teaser":"First, there was bloating, cramping, stomach pains and, like a form of withdrawal, lethargy.

	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<h4>What is the Winnipeg Free Press’ (FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership, or FPLP) privacy policy?</h4>
<p>FPLP recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about our customers. This includes subscribers to and users of our services, purchasers of our products, advertisers (including those who advertise in classified ads), contest entrants, and visitors to our website. We adhere to fair information practices and limit the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information which is provided to us, to only that information which is necessary for our business purposes, and to provide services to you.</p>
<p>FPLP collects personal information when we provide our services and our products to our customers and to fulfill administrative functions associated with these services, for example to permit billing, delivery of our newspapers and for marketing and other customer relationship purposes.

<p>We do not collect, use or disclose personal information about our customers without the consent of our customers, except where disclosure is permitted or required by law.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, FPLP will limit the use of information for the purpose for which it was collected and where we have identified a new use for that information, we will advise you and where reasonable and necessary secure your consent.</p>
<p>FPLP will retain personal information about customers for as long as is necessary for our business purposes and to comply with any applicable laws governing the retention of records.</p>
<p>When FPLP no longer requires the information for our business purposes or to meet those legal requirements, we will either destroy it or render it anonymous.</p>

<h4>Access to Information Procedure</h4>
<p>FPLP, on receipt of a written request by a customer and once that customer has verified that they are entitled to the personal information, will provide an opportunity to review any personal information that FPLP may have about that customer with the exception of any information gathered by its journalists and subject to exceptions set out in Section 9 of PIPEDA.</p>
<p>On receipt of written request and verification of the authority of the person to obtain the personal information, FPLP will make every effort to provide an opportunity for the customer to review the information within 30 days of the written request. If FPLP requires additional time to fulfill that request, the customer will be notified that a further period of time will be required to respond and a follow–up date will be given.</p>
<p>Before providing the information to a customer, FPLP will review that information and remove any sensitive commercial information about FPLP’s business practices and any personal information about identifiable third parties whom have not given consent for the information to be disclosed. If appropriate, the customer will be provided with a copy of the information, at the customer’s expense.</p>
<p>Where a customer believes that the personal information collected by FPLP is inaccurate, the customer may request FPLP make corrections to the personal information. FPLP may make the corrections requested. However, if there is a dispute between FPLP and the customer concerning the accuracy of the personal information collected, FPLP will note on the file that the customer disagrees with that personal information. If any third parties have been provided this information, FPLP will make all reasonable attempts to inform third parties of the correction.</p>
<h4>Personal Information Complaints</h4>
<p>If a customer wants to make a complaint about the manner in which FPLP has used, collected or disclosed personal information the complaint should be directed to the privacy officer. The customer should be assured that the complaint will be investigated and that if necessary the appropriate measures will be taken to correct FPLP’s information handling policies and practices.
