        </p>

        <h3>Definitions</h3>

        <h4>Personal Information</h4>

        <p class="light">As used herein, “Personal Information” means any information relating to an
        identified or identifiable natural person (each, a “Data Subject’); an identifiable natural person
        is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such

        </p>


        <h3>Personal Information We Collect</h3>

        <p class="light">We are a global company and thus may conduct business and collect Personal Information from
        individuals and institutions located within the European Economic Area (“EEA”). We are
        required to protect Personal Information processed in the EEA in accordance with the General Data Protection
        Regulation (“GDPR”). To understand more about how we protect the data we collect from individuals and institutions
        located within the EEA, please see the “Privacy Statement for Data Subjects Whose Personal Information
        May Be Collected in or from the EEA” section below.
        </p>

        <p class="light">Personal Information we collect may include the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Email address</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How We Use Personal Information We Collect</h3>

        <p class="light">We may share information with various third-party service providers
        (including those that may be located outside of the United States or your country), who help us
        operate our platform and systems in connection with our business. Such third-party service providers are
        subject to strict confidentiality obligations. In addition, we may be compelled to share information with
        law enforcement, government officials, and regulators.
        </p>

        <p class="light">Set forth herein is a non-exhaustive list of some examples of how we may use your information:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Provide you with notification when our methodology or constituents change</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="light">We do not sell user information to third parties for the purposes of marketing.</p>

        <h3>Direct Marketing</h3>

        <p class="light">Subject to applicable laws and regulations, we may from time to time send direct marketing materials promoting
        services, products, facilities or activities to you using information collected from you. An opt-out channel will
        be provided to enable you to exercise your right to opt out of such direct marketing.
        </p>

        <p class="light">We will not provide your information to third parties for direct marketing or other
        unrelated purposes without your written consent.
        </p>

        <p class="light">We reserve the right to modify the Privacy Policy at any time and for any
        reason in our sole and absolute discretion.
        </p>

        <h3>Privacy Statement for Data Subjects Whose Personal Information May Be Collected in or from the EEA</h3>

        <p class="light">While customers who are located in the EEA are customers of our US entity,
        we recognize and, to the extent applicable to us, adhere to relevant EEA data protection laws.
        </p>

        <h4>Collection and Transfer of Data Outside the EEA</h4>

        <p class="light">As outlined above, we may collect Personal Information from Data Subjects located in the EEA. To
        facilitate the services we provide to customers located in the EEA, we request explicit consent for the
        transfer of Personal Information from the EEA to the US. If you are an individual located in the EEA and
        you decline to consent to such transfer, you will no longer be able to receive notifications when our
        methodology or constituents change.
        </p>

        <h4>Lawful Grounds to Process and Obtain Consent</h4>

        <p class="light">We process the Personal Information of Data Subjects who are located in the EEA with their
        explicit consent to provide notifications when our methodology or constituents change.
        Data Subjects in the EEA may withdraw consent at any time where consent is the lawful basis for
        processing their Personal Information. Should a Data Subject withdraw consent for processing, a Data Subject
        may be unable to avail him or herself of the services we provide.
        </p>

        <h4>Automated Decision-Making</h4>

        <p class="light">We do not engage in automated decision-making.</p>

        <h4>Non-Disclosure of Personal Information</h4>

        <p class="light">Our employees are prohibited, either during or after their employment, from disclosing
        Personal Information to any person or entity outside of our company, including family members, except
        under the circumstances described above. An employee is only permitted to disclose the Personal Information of
        a customer to such other employees who need access to such information in order
        to deliver our services to that customer.
        </p>

        <h4>Our Contact Information for Persons Located within the EEA</h4>

        <p class="light">If you are located in the EEA or Switzerland and have questions or concerns
        regarding the processing of your Personal Information, you may contact us at:
        <a href="mailto:contact@winkdex.com">contact@winkdex.com</a>.
        If, as an EEA Citizen, you believe that we have not adequately resolved any such issues,
        you have the right contact the EU supervisory authority.
        </p>

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p class="light">If you have questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us at
        <a href="mailto:contact@winkdex.com">contact@winkdex.com</a>.
