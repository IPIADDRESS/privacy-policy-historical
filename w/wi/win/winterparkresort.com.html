<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Intrawest is committed to the privacy of our customers and guests (“you” and “your”). The Intrawest Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to Personal Information that Intrawest collects, whether online, in person, through our call centers or otherwise.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Personal Information” is information about an identifiable individual. Personal Information does not include information about a business or aggregated information that cannot be associated with a specific individual.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“</strong><strong>Intrawest”, “we”, “us” or “our” refers to </strong>Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc., its subsidiaries and certain of its affiliates. Intrawest has an international presence and maintains offices and facilities in multiple jurisdictions throughout the United States and Canada. Except in circumstances where the privacy policy of an affiliate or partner applies, all of Intrawest’s business operations are subject to this policy.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Policy does not apply to information about Intrawest’s employees or to information that is not Personal Information.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION INTRAWEST COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED</strong></p><br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Intrawest collects Personal Information in a number of circumstances during the course of operating our mountain resort adventure and real estate business.&nbsp; We use this information in order to provide you with the best possible service and to meet our reasonable business needs. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When you purchase a product or service, make a reservation or enroll in a program, we collect personal information in order to process the transaction and administer the program. &nbsp;We may also send you information relating to your purchase, reservation or program.&nbsp; For example, if you make a reservation at one of our resort locations, we may send you information about the activities, events or offers taking place at that resort.&nbsp; The information we may collect and use for these purposes includes but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">your name and contact information to identify and communicate with you </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">medical information, such as allergies or medical conditions that we need to be aware if you are participating in lessons or other programs, or have dietary restrictions </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">payment card information to process transactions </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">age and/or birth date, gender and biometric data (such as height, weight) where this information is necessary in connection with the product, service, program or activity that you have requested (for example, we may need gender, height and weight to provide you with appropriate rental equipment) </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">photograph to identify you as a guest </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">whether you’re the parent or guardian of a minor guest </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">information about your preferences (such as preferred lodging room type). </li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In some cases you may provide us with personal information relating to a family member or other individual.&nbsp; By providing us with personal information relating to an individual other than yourself, you represent that you have their consent to provide us with their personal information for the purposes described in this Policy. </p>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When you submit an inquiry or provide feedback</span></li>

<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When you participate in a marketing initiative or create an online account</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you choose to create an online account profile, we may collect your name, contact information, age, gender, birth date, personal image, username and password and other information that you choose to provide (such as your preferences).</p><br>

<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When you call our call center or we call you</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may record calls into and out of our call centers for the purposes of maintaining accurate records and for quality assurance and training purposes.&nbsp; We will retain call recordings for as long as reasonably necessary for these purposes. <strong></strong></p>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We collect your personal information when you visit our resorts and use Intrawest pass products and tickets</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you purchase or use Intrawest pass products and tickets, we may collect information regarding your geographic location, activities and purchases while you are at Intrawest resorts.&nbsp; Intrawest pass products and tickets use either handheld scanner or RFID (radio frequency identification) technology.&nbsp; Through the use of this technology, Intrawest may be able to collect information regarding your location at the resort, including the lifts that you ride, and depending on whether you have a payment card linked to your pass product, other commercial transactions that you complete at an Intrawest retail or restaurant location. We use this information to understand how our guests use our resorts and to understand your personal preferences.&nbsp; Depending on your marketing preferences, we may also use this information to send you personalized offers and invitations.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on your marketing preferences, we may also use this information to send you offers, invitations or promotions relating to our locations, products, services or programs that we believe may be of interest to you.&nbsp; For example, we may monitor your commercial transactions or browsing habits on our websites or at our resort locations which may influence the personalized special offers and promotions that we send to you.</p><br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Several of our resorts use GPS tracking technology in connection with their ski and ride school programs in order to track and locate students on the mountain.&nbsp; The GPS tracking technology is owned and operated by a third party service provider which may be provided certain information to operate websites on which you and/or your family members can track your day on the mountain.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At certain of our resort locations we may use video surveillance for the safety and security of our guests, employees and property. We will retain video recordings for as long as reasonably necessary for these purposes.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CONSENT</strong></p><br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Intrawest collects, uses and discloses your Personal Information as outlined in this Policy and with your consent, except where permitted or required otherwise by law.

In some instances, an authorized representative may consent on your behalf. In the case of minor children, a parent or legal guardian may consent to our collection, use and disclosure of a minor’s Personal Information.&nbsp; </p><br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restraints.
