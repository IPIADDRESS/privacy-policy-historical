<p>This is the official privacy policy (“<u>Privacy Policy</u>”) for the Internet website WikiCheats.com ("<u>Site</u>," "<u>we</u>," "<u>us</u>," or "<u>our</u>").  The Site is owned by Gametrailers Corp. (“<u>GT</u>”), a wholly-owned division of MTV Networks (“<u>MTVN</u>”), which is a division of Viacom International Inc. (“Viacom”) ( MTVN and Viacom collectively, the “<u>Parent Companies</u>”).  This Privacy Policy governs only the personally identifiable information ("<u>Personal Information</u>") collected by the Site and does not cover any such information collected in any other manner or for any other purpose, or for or by any other MTVN programming channel, MTVN’s “Jobhunt” website, GT, the Parent Companies or any subsidiaries or affiliates of GT or the Parent Companies (collectively, “<u>Affiliates</u>”), or any other company, unless specifically stated.
</p><p><br>
<b>Overview:  This Privacy Policy is intended to explain our privacy practices and inform you as to</b>: 
</p>
<ul><li> The kinds of Personal Information we collect from users of the Site and how that information is collected; 
</li><li> How we use your Personal Information; 
</li><li> The circumstances under which we disclose Personal Information to third parties; 
</li><li> How you can access, update or delete any Personal Information collected about you by us; and
</li><li> The mechanisms we have implemented to protect your Personal Information.
</li></ul>
<p><br>
This Site is offered and made available only to users 13 years of age or older who reside in the United States of America, its territories and possessions (“<u>U.S.</u>”). <b>If you are not yet 13 years old or the required greater age for certain features, or do not reside in the U.S., please discontinue using the Site immediately, or if, for any reason, you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the features, activities and services that require you to provide your Personal Information</b>.  This Privacy Policy is a part of the terms and conditions which are set forth in our <a href="/index.php/Terms_of_use" title="Terms of use">Terms of Use Agreement</a>. Any terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given in the Terms of Use Agreement.  Both the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement are legally binding on all users.  
</p><p><br>
We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice to you.  Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting.  Notice of material changes to either document will be posted on the Site’s homepage and/or will be provided by e-mailing you or notifying you upon login about these changes; the form of such notice is at our discretion.  However, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement often for updates.  
</p><p><br>
We are committed to protecting users' privacy.  Keeping the Personal Information you share with us on the Site secure and ensuring your understanding of how we collect, use, disclose and maintain your Personal Information is important to us.  We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information and while no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your Personal Information.

<a name="YOUR_CALIFORNIA_PRIVACY_RIGHTS"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline">YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</span></h1>
<p>If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives either an opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as “<u>unsubscribe</u>”) or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. 
</p><p><br>
The Site qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes.  Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. 
</p><p><br>
If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at privacy-admin@wikicheats.com, or you may contact us via regular mail at:

<b>All requests sent via regular mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy Rights" on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request</b>. For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code (your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email. Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping).  <b>We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile</b>. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.

Please be aware that any Personal Information you provide to us or we obtain as a result of your use of this Site will be transferred to the U.S. and subject to U.S. law.  By using this Site, participating in any Site activities, and/or providing us with your Personal Information, you consent to this transfer and processing of Personal Information to and in the U.S., and in other countries that may not have an equivalent level of protection or a level of data protection considered adequate in the European Union or European Economic Area.  Consequently, you hereby waive any claims that may arise under the laws and regulations that apply to you in or of any other country or jurisdiction.  All users of the Site are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal Information when prompted and we will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false, fraudulent, or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
</p><p><br> 
Your continued use of the Site indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information as described below.

</p><p><br>
</p>
<a name="1._Collection_and_Use_of_Personal_Information"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">1. Collection and Use of Personal Information</span></h2>

Personal Information also includes information about your personal preferences, survey responses and your transactions or relationship with us, if you have been a user of the Site or you have provided this type of information to any of the MTVN family of companies.  For example, to the extent we offer such services, if you order any of our various Products (as defined in the <a href="/index.php/Terms_of_use" title="Terms of use">Terms of Use Agreement</a>), in addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect and maintain your billing address, shipping address, Product selections, your credit card or other payment instrument information, your order number, and information about your computer's internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Site (e.g., the referring URL).  Your credit card or debit card number is classified as “<u>Sensitive Personal Information</u>” and is collected via a secure transmission.
</p><p><br>
We collect Personal Information about you when you visit the Site and input information, whether you are registering to use any services, features or functions of the Site, participating in Promotions (as defined in the <a href="/index.php/Terms_of_use" title="Terms of use">Terms of Use Agreement</a>), ordering or purchasing Products or in the course of any other exchanges of information, transactions and activities.  We may use the information we obtain from you, including Personal Information, to tailor your experience on the Site, to display content we think may be of interest to you, or to let us customize what you see when you visit the Site according to your preferences.
</p>
<dl><dd><b>a. Collection of Personal Information During Registration</b>.

<dl><dd>You may "opt out" of receiving marketing and promotional e-mails or text messages from us at any time by going to the Site’s home page, clicking the "my preferences" link, to change or edit your preferences.

<p><br>
</p>
<dl><dd>In the event that we, or our Affiliates, unknowingly sends an email or text message to a child (a person under the age of 13) or Ineligible Teenager (as defined in <u>Section 9</u>) who has registered with the Site or its features in violation of the Site’s  defined in the <a href="/index.php/Terms_of_use" title="Terms of use">Terms of Use Agreement</a>, the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child’s (or Ineligible Teenager’s) parent or legal guardian always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message, or to request termination of the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s registration and status as a registered user with the Site.  The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).  Please see the “<a href="#9._Review.2C_Update_or_Delete_Your_Personal_Information" title="">Review, Update, or Delete Your Personal Information</a>” Section below for details.

<p><br>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>f. Use of Communities</b>. If you use any of the Communities features and functions made available on or through the Site, please remember that any information disclosed in these venues is automatically made public.

<a name="2._Wireless_Marketing_Services_and_Promotional_Opportunities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">2. Wireless Marketing Services and Promotional Opportunities</span></h2>
<p>GT may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from GT, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device.  Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Companies or Affiliates for GT.  The Personal Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user’s telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier’s name.  Optional information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user’s preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information.  Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other information and, depending on the information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement. 
</p><p><br>
We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party’s interception of messages or a user’s Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.
</p><p><br>
Users that register for GT’s wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user’s wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from GT.  Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise.  <b>Under no circumstances will the Site, GT, its Parent Companies, or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user’s wireless device, telephone number, or email address</b>. 
</p><p><br>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>a. Registration</b>. To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for GT’s wireless marketing services.   Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the “single opt-in” or the “double-opt-in” (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of GT depending on the type of Promotion.  Premium rate services will require the “double opt-in” (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.
</dd></dl>
<p><br>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><b>1) Single Opt-in Method</b>:  In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.  The user’s voluntary submission of the designated word or code to GT will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to GT to send text messages to him or her. GT will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a “Thank you” message.  The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from GT or by sending a text message to GT that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><br>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><b>2) Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method</b>:  In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process.  The user must affirmatively consent to GT’s sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by GT) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site’s registration page.  The user must also agree to the Site’s Privacy Policy (this page) and <a href="/index.php/Terms_of_use" title="Terms of use">Terms of Use Agreement</a> before the online registration process is completed. GT will then send a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from GT to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of GT’s wireless marketing service.  Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.  A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time provided that GT may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while GT continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><br>
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><b>3) Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method</b>:  In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.  GT will then send a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from GT to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of GT’s wireless marketing service.  Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.  A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time provided that GT may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while GT continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><br>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>b. Termination of Wireless Services by User</b>.  Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from GT by the following procedure: 
</dd></dl>
<p><br>
</p>
<dl><dd>A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by GT at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.  GT will terminate the user’s registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user.  Any of these words followed by the word “ALL” in the user’s termination request will cancel all of the user’s registered wireless services with GT.  If the user unsubscribes from one or all GT service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user’s previous opt-in.
</dd></dl>
<p><br>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>c.  Termination of Wireless Services by GT</b>.  A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that GT may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice.  GT may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.
</dd></dl>
<p><br>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>d.  Use of Information</b>.  GT will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or other Personal Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use.  We will not share such Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure.  We will share such Personal Information with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with the Parent Companies and Affiliates.

However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information.

To review, update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected by the Site, [please click “log in” on the homepage to sign in to your Site account with your User ID.  Then, click on "my preferences" to change, update, or delete your Personal Information.]
</p><p><br>
If you wish to review Personal Information collected for Promotions such as contests and sweepstakes, you will need to contact the Site’s Privacy Administrator via email with a request at privacy-admin@wikicheats.com and be prepared to provide verification of your identity.  Personal Information collected for certain entries are subject to corporate and regulatory record keeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user’s request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.  
</p><p><br>
Children under the age of 13, or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site (“<u>Ineligible Teenagers</u>”), that are unknowingly registered on the Site are in violation of the <a href="/index.php/Terms_of_use" title="Terms of use">Terms of Use Agreement</a>.  Parents (including legal guardians) of children or Ineligible Teenagers that registered on the Site in violation of the Terms of Use Agreement who wish to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s membership must use their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID to gain direct access to the account, and select “my preferences” or alternatively, you can send us an email to the Site’s Privacy Administrator and provide us with your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID and request to terminate your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration.  We will not allow direct access to a user’s account and Personal Information by any person without the user’s User ID  (please see above for how to change your preferences or the information associated with your account).  If a parent does not have his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID, the parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the parent’s name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s date of birth.  The parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent of the ineligible child or Ineligible Teenager. GT will send a confirming email to the parent via the email address provided to verify that the parent wishes to terminate his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration.  The parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address.  GT will then terminate the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request. 
</p><p><br>
We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features or functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access the user’s account or any services, features or functions. And if the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.
