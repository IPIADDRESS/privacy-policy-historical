	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This privacy policy entails Searching Unlimited LTD's privacy practices for this Web site,
<a href="http://www.wiki.com/">http://www.wiki.com</a>, and any Searching Unlimited LTD based
Web site, for users of our services. By using the Site, you consent to the
terms of this privacy policy.</p>

<p>Although we respect the privacy of all those who visit the Web Site and use
our online services, we do collect information from our Web Site's members and
visitors. This Privacy Policy governs your interaction with the Web Site, and your
registration for and use of this Web Site's online services where available.
Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy and this Web Site's Terms of
Service and/or other published guidelines, we do not release personally
identifiable information about this Web Site's visitors without their
permission.</p>

<p>Please note that we review these privacy practices from time to time, and
that these practices are therefore subject to change. We ask that you
periodically review this page to ensure continuing familiarity with the most
current version of this Web Site's Privacy Policy. To contact us about privacy
issues, to report a violation of this Web Site's Privacy Policy, or to raise
any other issue regarding the Web Site, please email us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@wiki.com">webmaster@wiki.com</a>. </p>

<h2>The information we gather</h2>

<p>We gather two types of information about this Web Site's users:</p>

<p>(1) Non-personally identifiable information: When visitors come to the Web
Site, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things,
which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which
hyperlinks were "clicked." Collecting such information involves the
logging of IP addresses, operating system and browser software used by each
visitor to the Web Site. Although such information is not personally
identifiable, we can determine from the IP address a visitor's Internet Service
Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.</p>

<p>The non-personally identifiable information we collect helps us diagnose
problems with our server, administer the Web Site, identify the most popular
areas of the Web Site, and determine the effectiveness of our promotional
activities.</p>

<p>For the same purposes, we use "cookies"---that is, small text files
placed on your computer's hard drive---to help us determine the type of content
and sites to which you link, the length of time you spend at any particular
area of the Web Site, and your usage of our services offered via the Web Site.</p>

<p>Essentially, cookies are your identification cards for our computers, or
servers, that placed them there. Cookies are only read by the server that
placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus. Cookies allow us to
serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at
the Web Site. Nevertheless, you should be able to control how and whether
cookies will be accepted by your web browser. For more information on how to do
so, please refer to the documentation accompanying your browser.</p>

<p>(2) Personally identifiable information: In certain areas of the Web Site,
the Web Site may require---that you provide personally identifiable information
(including, for example, zip code, age, income, and email address). In
addition, when registering to set up an account to use certain services of the
Web Site such as e-commerce services, email, chat rooms, and forums, or to
receive certain newsletters or specifically targeted information
("Services"), we do require that you provide both your name and your
current, valid email address.</p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
children (defined herein as minors younger than 13 years of age) without
obtaining parental consent. Before registering for an account to use the
Services of the Web Site, we ask that all minors have their parents read our
Privacy Policy. Before and during the registration process, we encourage all
minors to include a parent or guardian in the process.</p>

<p>We do not control the acts of this Web Site's members or visitors. All
members and visitors should be aware that, when they disclose personally
identifiable information in a bulletin board, chat room, guest book, or other
forum, the information may be collected and used by others to send that person
unsolicited email from other parties. In the event that you encounter any user
on this Web Site who is improperly collecting or using information about you or
other users, please contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@mindtouch.com" title="mailto:webmaster@mindtouch.com">webmaster@wiki.com</a>. </p>

<h2>How we use (and do not use) the information we gather</h2>

<p>Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways we use
the information that we gather. Keep in mind that, while we encourage all third
parties involved to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of this Web
Site's visitors and members and to otherwise handle personal information in a
responsible manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any
actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use
information received either from us or independently. Nevertheless, in the
event you encounter any third party associated with, or who claims association
with us who you feel is improperly collecting or using information about you, please
contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@mindtouch.com" title="mailto:webmaster@mindtouch.com">webmaster@wiki.com</a>; we will be happy
to forward your message to the third party.</p>

<p>(1) How we use (and do not use) non-personally identifiable information: We
use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher
quality, more useful online services by performing statistical analyses of the
collective characteristics and behavior of the Web Site's visitors, and by
measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Web Site.</p>

<p>The Web Site may contain links to other Internet web sites, including
co-branded or other affiliated sites that may or may not be owned or operated
by us. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, we are not responsible for the
privacy practices or the content of such web sites, including such sites' use
of any information (such as IP number, browser type, or operating system)
collected when visitors to the web site click through links to those sites.
Even though such information might not identify you personally, we strongly
encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of those sites.</p>

<p>(2) How we use (and do not use) personally identifiable information: We
provide notice to potential registrants of this Web Site whose personally
identifiable information will be collected during the registration process.
Such notice is provided simultaneously with your registration with this
website; moreover, this Privacy Policy itself serves as notice that such information
is collected under those circumstances. Although you may not "opt
out" of the registration process if you wish to have access to Services,
you may choose to "opt out" of receiving promotional materials from
us and/or our other business partners. If you do not "opt out" of
receiving such promotional materials, we reserve the right to release any
personally identifiable registration information regarding you to third parties
who provide goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you. If you
decide that you would like to discontinue receiving promotional information
from such third parties, please contact those third parties directly, or
contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@mindtouch.com" title="mailto:webmaster@mindtouch.com">webmaster@wiki.com</a>.</p>

<p>We limit our own email contact and solicitations to those users who have not
"opted out" of receiving such communications. The solicitations are
limited in that they, among other things, will clearly indicate the originator
of the email and provide the user with a method of "opting out" of
receiving future communications of a similar nature.</p>

<p>Finally, we may use individual members' data to "pre-populate"
forms which are displayed for the purpose of collecting individual data by us.
In no case does pre-populating a form transfer any data to any third party.
Only if the user voluntarily requests that such data be transferred will any
transfer take place--for example, if/when a user clicks a "submit
form" button or other button.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to release any and all information contained within our
access logs concerning any visitor when that visitor is in violation of our
Terms of Service or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably
suspected of partaking) in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena,
warrant, or other court order, and to release such information in response to
discovery requests, or in response to any circumstance which we, in our sole
discretion, deem an emergency. We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in
identifying those who may be using our servers or services for illegal
activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity
to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution.</p>

<p>If and when we sponsor promotions, we will post relevant privacy information
in the official rules and/or registration area for the promotion. That privacy
information, to the extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, will govern
that particular promotion.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>All information gathered on the Web Site is stored within a controlled
database accessible only to us to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of
the information under our control. However, as effective as any security
measure implemented by us may be, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot
guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information
you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the
Internet. Questions regarding this Privacy Policy should be directed to us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@mindtouch.com" title="mailto:webmaster@mindtouch.com">webmaster@wiki.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Changing/deleting personal information</h2>

<p>If you would like to have your personally identifiable information changed
or removed from our database, please contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@mindtouch.com" title="mailto:webmaster@mindtouch.com">webmaster@wiki.com</a>,
and we will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. Keep in mind,
however, that there will be residual information that will remain within our
databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain such
personally identifiable information. The residual information will not be used
for commercial purposes; however we reserve the right, from time to time, to
re-contact former customers or users of this Web Site.</p>
