		<h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
		
		<h5>November 2010</h5>
		<p>The website available at http://www.wikiloc.com, including any of its subdomains or sections (the “Website”) is operated by Wikiloc Outdoor, S.L. (hereinafter, “Wikiloc”).</p>
		<p>This Privacy Policy deals with the processing of Website users’ personal data by Wikiloc.</p>
		<p>By accessing and using the Website, it is understood that the user has read and agreed to the terms of this Privacy Policy. The date at the beginning of this Privacy Policy refers to the latest update of this Privacy Policy, which will be applicable from the date of publication.

		<p>Wikiloc does not collect the age or the date of birth of its users. Accordingly, there is no specific processing of minor’s personal data. Wikiloc is only addressed to adults.</p>
		<p>Additionally, users may upload their trails to the Website, including geographical information, date, means of transport, trail duration, difficulty level, pictures taken, videos recorded and any comments they deem appropriate. Users may also identify their favorite trails, and keep track of other users’ activities.</p>
		
		<h5>2. COMMUNICATION OF PERSONAL DATA</h5> 
		<p>The way the Website works implies that part of the information provided by the users will be available to other Website users through the Website itself. Website users with access to that information could be located anywhere in the world. Users should refrain from providing information during the registration process which they do not want to make available to other Website users. Providing such additional information is not a requirement for using the Website. Users may, at any time, modify or delete this information (except for the nickname and email address) by accessing to “Your settings page”. However, Wikiloc will not publish users email unless they mark it as “public” during the registration process or afterwards.</p>
		<p>Additionally, users may mark the trails that they upload to the Website as “public” or “private”. By default, trails are marked as public and are available to other Website users. During the uploading process or at any time afterwards users will be able to modify this attribute for each of their trails by editing the trail properties.</p>
		<p>Any user publishing at any part of the Website personal information of third parties must have previously obtained such third parties’ consent.</p> 
		<p>Public trails and certain information related to them are shared with Google Inc. and Google group companies, and may be displayed through the Google Earth viewer. Wikiloc does not assume any liability in relation to the processing of users’ personal data by Google.</p>
		<p>Wikiloc also offers users the possibility to show their trails on Facebook. In order to do this, Wikiloc and Facebook must share user’s personal data. Wikiloc does not assume any liability in relation to the processing of these personal data by Facebook.</p>
		<p>Wikiloc runs a forum in which users request help or make suggestions. Personal data provided by the users in this forum are subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, and are available to other users of the forum.</p>
		
		<h5>3. EXERCISE OF THE RIGHTS OF ACCESS, RECTIFICATION, CANCELATION AND OBJECTION.</h5> 
		<p>Wikiloc guarantees the exercise of the rights of access, rectification, cancelation and right to objection that Constitutional Law 15/1999, grants data subjects before the data controllers. As provided above, users may access and modify their information directly in “Your settings page”.</p> 
		<p>Any data subject who intends to exercise any such rights in connection with personal data processed by Wikiloc should contact Wikiloc at the address of the data controller included in this Privacy Policy or the following email address:&nbsp;<a id="eml0" href="mailto:info@wikiloc.com">info@wikiloc.com</a>&nbsp;, including in the message’s subject a clear reference to the right he/she intends to exercise and addressing the email to the attention of Wikiloc’s governing body.</p>
		<p>Pursuant to Royal Decree 1720/2007 the exercise of rights shall be made in accordance with the procedure below.</p>
		
		<p>The communication shall be addressed to the data controller and shall include:</p> 
		<ul>
			<li>1. First and second names of the data subject; a copy of his/her identity card, passport or any other valid document which identifies him/her or, if applicable, of the persona representing him/her (in this latter case evidence of the authority to represent the data subject);</li>
			<li>2. request being made;</li>
			<li>3. address where notifications may be served to the data subject, date and signature;</li>
			<li>4. supporting documentation for the request being made, if any.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Wikiloc shall answer the request made to it in all cases, regardless of whether or not there is personal data of the particular data subject within its personal data filing systems. If the request does not comply with the requirements above, Wikiloc shall request the data subject to provide the necessary additional information.</p>
		<p>The following provisions will apply depending on Wikiloc’s collection of certain types of personal data:</p>
		
		<h5>4. USE OF COOKIES AND IP ADDRESSES OF WEBSITE USERS</h5>
		<p>The Website uses cookies to facilitate and customize user navigation through the Website.</p>
		<p>In operating this Website, Wikiloc may use cookies. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer or computers that host the Webite give to the user’s browser when accessing the Website. Wikiloc cookies help provide additional functionality to the Website and help Wikiloc analyze the Website usage more accurately. For instance, the Website may set a cookie on the user’s browser that keeps him or her from needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Website. On most web browsers, users will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Wikiloc refers to this section for information on how to receive notification when receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. Wikiloc recommends that users leave cookies turned on because they allow users to take advantage of some of the Website’s features.</p>
		<p>Wikiloc does not use cookies with advertising purposes, nor to associate browsing data with individuals that have not been previously identified.</p>
		<p>This Website also has access to the IP address with which each user access the website. The IP address with which each user accesses the Website may be different each time. Additionally, different users can share a single IP address.</p>
		<p>Even though Wikiloc does not and will not perform any attempt to associate the IP address with specific individuals, accessing IP addresses could be regarded as a processing of personal data, given the possibility to identify the individual to which an IP address is associated (more a theoretical than an actual possibility), so according to the applicable data protection law, this Privacy Policy will apply.</p>
		<p>Third parties advertising in the Website could use cookies or ‘web beacons’ of which Wikiloc would not be responsible and which would not be governed by this Privacy Policy, so it is the responsibility of the user to set the options in his/her browser so cookies are only used according to his own preferences.</p>
		
		<h5>5. COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED IN THE WEBSITE’S CONTACT SECTION AND COMMENTS INCLUDED IN THE BLOG</h5>
		<p>Any data received by Wikiloc in the contact form available at the Website are solely used for the purpose of answering queries, suggestions or complaints submitted by users of the Website.</p>
		<p>The blog available at Wikiloc.com is hosted by blogger.com who will store any comments posted. Wikiloc will only use any personal data that might be included in comments posted for the purpose of answering the relevant comment.</p>
		 
		<h5>6. GENERAL AND CONTACT INFORMATION</h5>
