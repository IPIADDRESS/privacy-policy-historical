Privacy policy
</h1>
<p>
<em>May 2018</em>
</p>
<p>
The website available at <a href="https://www.wikiloc.com">https://www.wikiloc.com</a>, including any of its subdomains or sections (the "<strong>Website</strong>") and any of the mobile applications linked to the Website ("<strong>Applications</strong>") are operated by Wikiloc Outdoor, S.L. ("<strong>Wikiloc</strong>").
</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy deals with the processing of Website and Applications users’ personal data by Wikiloc as part of the services provided through the Website and the Applications ("<strong>Services</strong>").
</p>
<p>
By accessing and using the Website or the download or use of the Applications, it is understood that the user has read and agreed to the terms of this Privacy Policy. The date at the beginning of this Privacy Policy refers to the latest update of this Privacy Policy, which will be applicable from the date of publication. Thus Wikiloc recommends that this Privacy Policy is reviewed on a regular basis by the user.
</p>
<p>
Some of the Services provided through the Website or of the Applications may be subject to specific privacy policies that will complement or, if in conflict with this Privacy Policy, supersede the terms of this Privacy Policy. The user will accept any specific privacy policies that may apply before the provision of such service commences.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, access and use of the Website, and download and use of the Applications and Services are subject to the Terms of Use.
</p>
<h2>
1. PERSONAL DATA FILES, PURPOSES OF THE PROCESSING AND TYPES OF PERSONAL DATA
</h2>
<p>
Wikiloc process personal data collected through the Services for the purpose of managing the Website and the Applications and also for providing or improving the provision of Services, including emailing about the Service, the trails requested by the user, the content accessed by the User or with information about the Service, the Website or Applications.
</p>
<p>
Personal data that can be collected at the time of registration of the user or afterwards, are the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Nickname (mandatory).
</li>
<li>Password (mandatory).
</li>
<li>Email address (mandatory).
</li>
<li>Home page or weblog.
</li>
<li>About user (description).
</li>
<li>Photo.
</li>
<li>Activities of interest.
</li>
<li>User’s location.
</li>
<li>Units of measure.
</li>
<li>Privacy settings.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Wikiloc does not collect the age or the date of birth of its users. Accordingly, there is no specific processing of minor’s personal data. Wikiloc is only addressed to users above 16 years old. If the user is under age he should not register on Wikiloc.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, users may upload their trails through the Services, including geographical information, date, means of transport, trail duration, difficulty level, pictures taken, videos recorded and any comments they deem appropriate. Users may also identify their favorite trails, and keep track of other users’ activities.
</p>
<p>
If the user wishes to use the Services which include location features, such as the recording of a trail or of a point of interest or the navigation through a downloaded trail, the Services may imply the processing of the location of the user, which will be used for the purposes stablished hereunder and to allow or improve the Service.
</p>
<p>
Likewise, when the user uses the Application for Garmin Connect IQ, the Application will collect and retain the anonymous identifier of the Garmin device and associate it with the account of the user in the Services, in order to maintain the session and avoid the introduction of user and password in the uninstalls or updates of the Application. The user may at any time unlink and eliminate such association through the profile settings.
</p>
<p>
Any information received from Wikiloc in the Contact form available in the Website will only be used with the purpose of solving queries, suggestions or claims sent from the users in the Website. Also, personal data included on the comments in the blog of wikiloc.com will only be used for the purpose of answering those comments when necessary.
</p>
<p>
The legal basis for processing the user’s personal data is the contractual relationship for the rendering of Services or when appropriate, the fulfillment of the user’s request, as well as the legitimate interest of Wikiloc in offering the Services in the different channels where the trails may be published and in informing about news on the Service offered to users registered that have not rejected the receipt of this information.
</p>
<p>
Personal data will be stored during the period required for the compliance with the purpose for which the data was collected and, afterwards, during the periods required by applicable regulations. When a user’s application for registration is not validated within 7 days, the user’s data will be erased.

<h2>2. USE OF COOKIES</h2>

A cookie is a small piece of text that web sites you visit send to the browser to allow the web site to remember information about your visit.&nbsp;Wikiloc uses cookies to remember preferences such as your language, increasing the relevancy of the ads you see, count the number of visitors on pages or allow you to log in to download content and access your personal space. Wikiloc uses cookies to remember preferences such as your language, increasing the relevancy of the ads you see, count the number of visitors on pages or allow you to log in to download content and access your personal space.</p>
<p>
Wikiloc cookies help provide additional functionality to the Website and help Wikiloc analyze the Website usage more accurately. For instance, the Website may set a cookie on the user’s browser that prevents the user from having to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Website. On most web browsers, users will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Wikiloc refers to this section for information on how to receive notification when receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. Wikiloc informs users that allowing the use of cookies by their browser will permit users to take advantage of some of the Website's features.
</p>
<h3>What kind of cookies uses Wikiloc?</h3>
<p>
We use our own cookies with the sole purpose of providing you an enjoyable navigation such as remembering the language in which you prefer to browse the site or session information to allow you access your personal space on Wikiloc.
</p>
<p>
Wikiloc does not use own cookies with advertising purposes, nor to associate browsing data with individuals that have not been previously identified.
</p>
<h3>We also use third party cookies, Google Analytics and Google AdSense</h3>
<p>
Third parties advertising on the Website could use cookies or ‘web beacons’ for which Wikiloc would not be responsible and which would not be governed by this Privacy Policy, so it is the responsibility of the user to set the options in his/her browser in order that cookies are only used according to his/her own preferences.
</p>
<p>

Google has detailed and updated information on these cookies: <a href="https://www.google.es/intl/es/analytics/privacyoverview.html">http://www.google.es/intl/es/analytics/privacyoverview.html</a>

</p>
<h3>How to disable cookies in your browser</h3>
<p>
Browsers allow you to configure the acceptance or rejection of cookies. These settings depend on each browser but you can usually find them in the "Options" or " Preferences" on the browser’s main menu. <a href="https://www.agpd.es/portalwebAGPD/CanalDelCiudadano/protegetuprivacidad/index-iden-idphp.php">For further information, click here.</a>
