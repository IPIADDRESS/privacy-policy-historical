<p dir="ltr">Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy apply only to information gathered online at our Website. It does not apply to information that you may submit to us offline, or to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By visiting our Website, you are accepting the practices described in our Privacy Policy. &nbsp;If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website. &nbsp;As our Website continues to develop, we may add new services and features to our Website. These additions may affect our Privacy Policy. Accordingly, we reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time without notice. &nbsp;Such modifications and amendments shall be effective immediately upon their being posted to the Website. We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy each time you use our website. &nbsp;However, we will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information we have previously collected without your express consent. &nbsp;Your continued use of our Website following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. &nbsp;If we intend to apply the modifications or amendments to this Privacy Policy retroactively, we will provide you with notice of the modifications or amendments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or don’t see your concerns addressed here, you should contact us by email at wimpykid@abramsbooks.com.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">What Information About Me Is Collected and Stored?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Wimpy Kid adheres to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, the California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003, and all other applicable laws and regulations, as well as to the highest standards of ethical practices in all of our operations. We are dedicated to protecting the privacy of all visitors to our Website.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Personal Information</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Wimpy Kid never automatically collects any personal information that specifically identifies Website users and does not condition or require anyone to share personal information to use the WimpyKid.com website. &nbsp;Unless you provide comments to the website or submit information to Wimpy Kid, we do not collect any personally identifiable information from you. &nbsp;If you are a person age 13 or older, and you submit comments or information, or send us e-mail, we may collect identifiable information about you that is included in such communications, such as your name and email address. &nbsp;Such information is only kept for a period long enough to respond to your communication and is promptly deleted thereafter.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Anonymous Information</h3>
<p dir="ltr">When you interact with the Website, our servers may keep an activity log that does not identify you individually (“Anonymous Information”). Generally, this information is collected through “traffic data.” We collect and store certain administrative and traffic information with each use of the service or Website including: source IP address, time of access, date of access, web page(s), software crash reports, type of browser used, session identification number, search terms, search results, access times and referring websites addresses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We use Anonymous Information to help us determine how people use parts of the Website and who our users are so we can improve our Website and ensure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many people as possible. &nbsp;We also use Anonymous Information to provide statistical “ratings” information in aggregated form to our partners and other third parties about how our users collectively use the Website. We may also use or share Anonymous Information (or other information, other than Personal Information) in any other manner that we deem appropriate or necessary.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Use of Cookies and Spyware</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We never use or install spyware on your computer, nor do we use spyware to retrieve information from your computer. &nbsp;Like many Websites, we use “cookies”, which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences. We use cookies to track use of our Website and online services. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Website and make it easier and/or relevant for your use. &nbsp;You may occasionally get cookies from companies advertising on our behalf. &nbsp;We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to this cookie policy. &nbsp;You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you disable cookies, certain areas of the Website maybe not be accessible or function correctly.

<p dir="ltr">We do not at present collect any personally identifying information from children under age 13. If you are under 13 years of age, you should not under any circumstance provide personally identifiable information to Wimpy Kid. In the event that Wimpy Kid discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided Wimpy Kid with personally identifiable information, Wimpy Kid will immediately delete that information from the Website. As stated earlier, our policy may change in the future, so please check back here regularly to get our latest policy,</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Parents and Guardians</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We encourage you to get involved with your children’s online usage and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. We also ask you to check back here regularly to see what our latest policies are, particularly those relating to children.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You should be aware that if your children voluntarily disclose their names, e-mail addresses or other information on bulletin boards or chat areas of other Web sites, such disclosures may result in unsolicited messages from other parties. We suggest that you discourage your child from providing such information unless you are confident that the information will not be misused.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you have any concerns regarding privacy issues, please contact us at the above e-mail address, and browse away!</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">How We Use Your Information?</h3>

<h3 dir="ltr">Third-Party Agents</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We occasionally have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and partners that perform functions on our behalf, such as marketing, analytics, providing customer service, fraud protection, etc. &nbsp;These entities have access to the Personal Information needed to perform their functions and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that Personal Information. &nbsp;They are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to the Website.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The importance of security for all Personal Information associated with you is of utmost concern to us.
