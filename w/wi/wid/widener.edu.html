                  <p><strong>How Personal Information is Shared Outside Widener</strong></p>

                     as third-party providers, vendors, and others acting on behalf of the University,

                     other than providing services to users.&nbsp; Widener does not sell Personal Information
                     to third-party data brokers. The University may share Personal Information pursuant

                  <p><strong>Sharing Cookies and Technical Information with Third Parties</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>The University has relationships with authorized third-party providers whose services
                     are accessed through the Campus Cruiser portal or other webservices. In order to facilitate

                     information, each time.

                  <p>We use the information we get from web analytics tools such as Google Analytics to

                  <p><strong>Digital Marketing and Ad Networks&nbsp;</strong></p>
                  
                  <p>We may sometimes use "interest-based" advertisements also known as "online behavioral
                     advertising." Online behavioral advertising is advertising that is directed to you
                     based, at least in part, on your Internet browsing behavior across websites and over
                     time. Although we do not share Personal Information with the third parties that conduct
                     interest-based advertising operations on our behalf, these third parties and their
                     affiliates do collect certain information as a result of their javascript "tags" and
                     other technologies being used on our website. The information that they collect includes
                     the names of web pages you view (URL's), unique identifiers, your IP address, timestamp,
                     and certain types of technical information.&nbsp; A longer list of some of the technologies
                     used for advertising and other purposes on our website and in our mobile apps are
                     listed under the "Technologies Used" section.

                  <p>Third Parties May Collect Personal Information from Other Sources.&nbsp;</p>
                  
                  <p>Some third parties involved in advertising operations may maintain their own proprietary
                     consumer databases that allow them to personally identify or track website visitors.
                     Other third parties have proprietary technologies to determine what additional devices
                     you may use, on which it can display relevant advertisements.

                  <p>Do Not Track&nbsp;</p>
                  
                  <p>Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal
                     that an Internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites
                     that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third-parties as defined by the initiative.
                     The online community has not agreed on what actions, if any, should be taken by the
                     websites that receive the “do not track” signal, and therefore Do-Not-Track is not
                     yet standardized. Our website does not alter its behavior or change its services when
                     it receives a “do-not-track” flag or signal from your browser.

                  <p>You can make decisions about your privacy and the ads you receive. You can control
                     whether companies serve you on-line behavioral advertising by visiting the Digital
                     Advertising Alliance website and using its opt-out: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.&nbsp;
                     The DAA opt-out requires that cookies not be blocked in your browser.

                  <p>As an alternative to the DAA opt–out, you can also elect to block browser cookies
                     from first parties (such as those from our website) and browser cookies from third
                     parties (such as advertisers) by using the cookie blocking options built into your

                     that may uniquely identify your browser.

                  <p>There are some instances where the University may deny a request to remove information.
                     For example, the University may decline to remove the following types of information,
                     including, but not limited to:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>information required to be maintained by the University as part of student or employment
                        records, or pursuant to local, state or Federal law, statute or other regulation,
                        or in performance of contractual obligations
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>information compiled in reasonable anticipation of, or for use in a civil, criminal

                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>The University will generally respond to requests no later than sixty (60) days after

                     of disagreement. The University may also provide a right to have the denial reviewed.
                     If the University is unable to act within sixty (60) days, we may extend that time
                     by no more than an additional thirty (30) days. If we need to extend this time, we
