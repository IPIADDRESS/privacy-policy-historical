<p>Please read the following Privacy Policy to understand how we handle the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. </p>
<p>Our policy is guided by the provincial and federal privacy laws applicable in British Columbia, Canada.

However, Wider Funnel Marketing Inc. does not have a duty to make any such disclosures. </p>
<p> Neither Wider Funnel Marketing Inc. nor any party it contracts with will disclose Customer Data or Confidential Information to any other person unless such disclosure is required or authorized by law, or with prior written consent of the other party. In the event that a party is legally compelled, through whatever means, to provide access to Customer Data or Confidential Information, then the disclosing party will provide the other party with Notification of such an event as soon as it is reasonably practical to do so as to afford the opportunity to limit or prevent such disclosure. </p>
