For more information about how social networking websites handle your personal information, please refer to their respective privacy policies and terms of use.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clear GIFs, Cookies and IP Addresses</strong></p><p>Clear GIFs, sometimes called "web bugs" or “pixel tags,” or “web beacons” are file objects, usually a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one pixel GIF (Graphics Interchange Format, one of the two most common file formats for images on the Web), that are placed on a web page or in an email message to monitor user behavior. The GIF tells us the IP address of the computer that fetched our page, the URL of the page the GIF is on, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and it can also identify a previously set cookie value, and how and where a user accessed a website. This anonymous information is returned by the clear GIF to Wizards and we use this information to accurately count visitors across our Websites and understand how they navigate and use our network of Websites. We not combine information gathered through clear GIFs with your personal information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We use "cookies" to enhance your experience at our Websites and to understand how you interact with our Websites, products and services. Cookies are pieces of information that we place on your computer to help us accurately understand how many consumers are visiting a particular site, how often they visit that site and what content they are most interested in viewing. For example, a cookie will allow us to remember certain things based on your Internet Protocol or "IP" address (an IP address is the string of numbers that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent across the Internet), such as the time and duration of your visits, how you navigated through our content and where you exited a particular site. To learn more about how we use cookies, please visit our Cookie Policy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wizards' Websites collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our Websites. When visitors request pages on one of our Websites, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our community rules, <a href="http://company.wizards.com/conduct">Code of Conduct</a>, or posted <a href="http://company.wizards.com/tou">Terms of Use</a>, or to protect our Services, Websites, customers, or others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Log Files</strong></p><p>Other information passively collected by Wizards is in the form of logs -- files that record web site activity and gather statistics about web users' browsing habits. These entries are generated anonymously, and help Wizards determine (among other things) how many and how often users have visited our Websites, which pages they've visited, and other similar data. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who is collecting my information and how will it be used?</strong></p><p>We, or our third party partners and service providers, collect information you provide through our Websites or when you interact with us. We may use the information you submit to us to send you advertising or promotional materials including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers and other events of interest. We may also use your personal information for our internal research and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve our products and services. The demographic information (e.g., age and gender) you provide us is collected by Wizards and may be disclosed in aggregate to third parties. This aggregate demographic information cannot be used to personally identify you or your computer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Third parties who fulfill online services such as hosting or Customer Support may collect the personal information you provide through our Websites. These third parties will not use your personal information for any purpose other than to provide the related services, and have agreed to maintain confidentiality, surveys, security, and integrity of your personal information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>With whom does Wizards share my personal information?</strong></p><p>Wizards may share your information with its related entities including its parent and sister companies. Wizards may also share personal information with third party service providers who assist us with operating our Websites or provide us with various services (e.g. organized play, community operations, online product fulfillment, email services, marketing and promotional services, or technical support). These entities will not use your personal information for any other purpose than that for which it was received by Wizards, and they agree to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of all information (personal or otherwise) they receive from us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wizards also may disclose your personal information in order to fulfill a service to you. For example, if you are entering a sweepstakes or contest, we may use your personally identifiable information in order to fulfill the terms of that promotion. This means that we may share the information for prize fulfillment purposes or mail carriers. Also, if you make a purchase on one of our Websites, your credit card data may have to be disclosed to an unaffiliated third party payment processing company as necessary to complete your purchase (for example, to process your credit card). In the event that such data is shared, Wizards will take all reasonable steps to ensure applicable third parties adequately protect the data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law including, but not limited to, disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.</p><p>Except as set forth herein, Wizards of the Coast LLC, as a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc. does not sell or rent personal information collected from and about its customers (including children under 13) to third parties. However, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, Wizards' customer information may be transferred to Wizards' successors or assigns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you engaged in organized play, your full name, DCI number, city, state and email will be accessible by authorized tournament organizers, retail locations that are part of the Wizards Play Network, and members of the Wizards’ community that are adjudicating organized play events solely for the purpose of facilitating organized play.
