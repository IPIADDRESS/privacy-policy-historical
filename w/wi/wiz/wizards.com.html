<h2 align="center">Wizards' Website Privacy Policy</h2> 
<a name="top">
<h3 align="center">WELCOME!</h3>

</a><p><a name="top">Wizards of the Coast's website brings you the coolest information about the world of Wizards and provides a firsthand look at some of our games. If you are a parent or guardian and are interested in knowing more about Wizards' policy regarding the online collection of information from children, we recommend reviewing the </a><a href="#8">Note To Parents</a> below.</p>

<p>In our privacy statement, you will find:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#1">What personal information may be collected and by what means;</a></li>
<li><a href="#2">Who, if anyone, is collecting your personal information;</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">How this information may be used, including, who-if anyone-it might be shared with;</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">The consequences-if any-resulting from your refusal to provide personal information;</a></li>
<li><a href="#5">How you can access and, if necessary, change your personal information a company maintains;</a></li>
<li><a href="#6">How a company ensures data security, quality, and integrity; and,</a></li> 
<li><a href="#7">Where and how to ask questions or file complaints.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>By using this site, you signify your assent to Wizards' Privacy Statement. If you do not agree with the policies contained in this Statement, please do not use our site. Your continued use of Wizards' site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. So, please, check back here for updates.</p>

<p>For additional information about our website, please see our <a href="/company/WebSiteLegalNotice.asp">Legal Notice</a>.</p>

<a name="1"><h3>What personal information may be collected and by what means?</h3>
<p>Specifically, we may collect information for the following circumstances: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Email</b><br>
By allowing you to send email to us, we are not attempting to collect any personal information about you except where explicitly stated otherwise. We will only use any personal information (such as name, mailing address, and email address) contained in your email to respond to your specific inquiry or comments in the email. Though we may retain your email for a period of time, we will not use any personal information contained in your email for any purpose other than responding to your specific inquiry or comments.</li>
<li><b>Promotions and Surveys</b><br>
To participate in some of our promotions and surveys, you may be asked to provide an email address or screen name, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. We may request your name and home address in order to send you products or information by regular mail. Remember, children under 13 years of age will be required to submit a parent or guardian's email address so that they can be notified of the child's participation and disallow it if they choose.</li>
<li><b>WIZARDS.COMmunity Chat, Bulletin Boards, and Mailing Lists</b><br>
Since Wizards' free interactive community activities are moderated, registered members under 13 years of age may participate in such activities upon registration, unless their parent or guardian asks that their registration be disallowed. Personal information of registered users is not accessible by the public unless the member adds it to his or her User Information or is disclosed by the user themselves in a public post.</li>
<li><b>Résumés</b><br>
Wizards allows for the online submission of résumés. Personal information collected by allowing for résumé submission will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings. This information may be shared within the company.</li>
<li><b>Online Ordering [E-store]</b><br>
You are not required to register in order to browse the store, but first-time shoppers will be required to register as a part of the checkout process. To do so, all we need from you is your email address and a password. That creates an account for you so that if you ever have a question about an order, we can quickly help you with it. We do collect financial information (account or credit card numbers) as it relates to the purchase of products in the store. Contact information (name, phone number, postal, email, and IP addresses) is collected in order to ship or get in touch with an individual regarding a purchase. We will not collect any personal information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. We do not sell or share any of this information with third parties. </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, we sometimes collect information to find out how people found the Wizards' site, which pages they visited, and how long they stayed. This information does not include any personal information about you. Some examples of this type of data collection are:</p>

</a><ul><a name="1">
</a><li><a name="1"><b>IP Addresses </b><br>
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. <br>
Wizards' website collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When visitors request pages on Wizards' website, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our community rules [</a><a href="/community/main.asp?x=onlineconduct">Code of Conduct</a>] or posted <a href="/company/WebSiteLegalNotice.asp">Legal Notice</a>, or to protect our service, site, customers, or others. <br>
Some services within Wizards' website, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name, email address, and message. Please review each service prior to use and only use those that disclose information you are comfortable with sharing. </li>

<li><b>Cookies</b><br>
Cookies are pieces of information placed on your computer to help personalize your visit to the site. For example, a cookie will allow us to remember certain things about you, such as your screen name or where you left off in a game. Most major websites use cookies exactly for this purpose. We cannot tell who you are or where you are with cookies. The cookie only tells us that you have visited the site before and may contain certain information that will help us make your visit more enjoyable.<br>
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some parts of Wizards' website will not function properly if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences or you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, chatting on the site, entering contests, or playing games.</li>
</ul>

<p>Visitors should be aware that when you are on Wizards' site, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement in one of our online publications or visit one of our fan sites, you will leave our site. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.</p>

<a name="2"><h3>Who, if anyone, is collecting your personal information?</h3>
<p>In instances where Wizards collects personal information on the website, we will include how the information is used and who will be privy to it. In most instances, the information will be have one of the following notations along with opt-out information and parental notification instructions for visitors under the age of 13.</p>
<ul>
<li>We will discard the data following the submission</li>
<li>We will keep the data to use for further contact regarding this submission (only)</li>
<li>We will keep the data to use for further contact regarding other communication</li>
<li>We will keep the data and may post the information in a public forum (winner's list, etc.)</li>
</ul>

</a><a name="3"><h3>How this information may be used, including, who-if anyone-it might be shared with.</h3>
<p>Wizards wants to give you the most exciting Internet experience possible. To help us figure out what you like and don't like about our site, we may ask for your opinion, whether you would like to receive information about new Wizards' products, set preferences for you so that the web pages you visit appear the way you want them to, or offer you online contests.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, all information is for Wizards of the Coast's, a division of Hasbro, Inc., exclusive use. Wizards does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever from our visitors.</p>

<p>Visitors to Wizards' website under the age of 13 are required to provide the email address of a parent or guardian. A notification message is sent to the parent or guardian which identifies the information supplied at registration and in order for the parent or guardian to be aware of and participate in the child's online experience or disallow the registration.</p>

</a><a name="4"><h3>The consequences-if any-resulting from your refusal to provide personal information.</h3>
<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of Wizards' website will not function properly if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences or you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, chatting on the site, entering contests, or playing games. </p>

</a><a name="5"><h3>How Wizards ensures data security, quality, and integrity.</h3>
<p>The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our visitors is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information Wizards of the Coast can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. When credit card information is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. Two ways you can determine if you are using a secure socket layer site is that the URL will begin with "https://" and a closed padlock will appear in the lower left of your Internet browser. If you do not see these indicators of a SSL, do not submit your financially sensitive information.</p>

</a><a name="6"><h3>How you can access and, if necessary, change your personal information.</h3>
<p>All information that Wizards collects, including information which may be used for marketing and promotional purposes, is subject to an "opt-out" process described on, or linked to, each collection form. If you do not want Wizards to send you email or regular mail about our products and/or services, you can opt-out at the time of registration/information collection or at a later date by sending an email to the address given at the point of information collection. (As we have a variety of databases that are not connected, sending a general e-mail to webmaster will not always remove you from the database you want to opt-out of.) Please be sure to include in your message the email address you used to register so that we can verify your request.</p>

</a><a name="7"><h3>Where and how to ask questions or file complaints.</h3>
</a><p><a name="7">If you have any questions, complaints, or comments regarding our privacy statement, please contact </a><a href="mailto:webmaster@wizards.com">webmaster@wizards.com</a>.</p>

<a name="8"><h3 align="center">NOTE TO PARENTS </h3>

Please discuss this statement with your children so that they will better understand how to use the site and the information they may be asked to provide. Wizards strongly believes that providing its visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the website will lead to informed choices and decisions about how to use the site, as well as protecting its users' privacy.
