We may use the information you submit to our Sites to send you advertising or promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers and other events of interest. We may also use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and can better meet your needs. The demographic information (e.g., age and gender) you provide us is collected by Wizards and may be disclosed in aggregate to third parties.

<p>Third parties who fulfill Site-related services such as hosting may collect the personal information you provide on our Sites.

    </a>With whom does Wizards share my personal information?</b>
</p>
<p>Wizards may share your information with its related entities, including its parent and sister companies.</p>
<p>Wizards may share your personal information with outside entities hired to assist with internal web site support operations (e.g., community operations, online product fulfillment, e-mail services, or technical support). These entities will not use your personal information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain confidentiality, surveys, security, and integrity of all the personal information they obtain from us. </p>
<p>Wizards also may disclose your personal information in order to fulfill a service to you. For example, if you are entering a sweepstakes or contest, we may use your personally identifiable information in order to fulfill the terms of that promotion. This means that we may share the information for prize fulfillment purposes or mail carriers. Also, if you make a purchase on one of our sites, your credit card data may have to be disclosed to an unaffiliated third party payment processing company as necessary to complete your purchase (for example, to process your credit card). In the event that such data is shared, Wizards will take all reasonable steps to ensure the applicable third parties protect the data adequately.</p>
<p>We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.</p>
<p>Except as set forth herein, Wizards of the Coast LLC, as a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc. does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose personal information collected from and about its users (including children under 13) to third parties. However, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, Wizards' customer information may be transferred to Wizards' successor or assign, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <a name="gifs">
    </a>Clear GIFs, Cookies and IP Addresses</b>
</p>
<p>Clear GIFs, sometimes called "web bugs" or “pixel tags,” are file objects, usually a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one pixel GIF (Graphics Interchange Format, one of the two most common file formats for images on the Web), that are placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user behavior. The GIF tells us the IP address of the computer that fetched our page, the URL of the page the GIF is on, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and it can also identify a previously set cookie value. This anonymous information is returned by the clear GIF to Wizards and we use this information to accurately count visitors across our web sites and understand how they navigate and use our network of web sites. Wizards does not combine information gathered through clear GIFs with your personal information.</p>
<p>Wizards uses "cookies" to enhance your experience at our Sites. Cookies are pieces of information that we place on your computer to help us accurately understand how many consumers are visiting a particular site, how often they visit that site and what content they are most interested in viewing. For example, a cookie will allow us to remember certain things based on your Internet Protocol or "IP" address (an IP address is the string of numbers that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent across the Internet), such as the time and duration of your visits, how you navigated through our content and where you exited a particular site. </p>
<p>Wizards' web sites collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our web sites. When visitors request pages on one of our web sites, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our community rules <a href="/Company/About.aspx?x=wz_company_about_codeofconduct&amp;menu=Awards">Code of Conduct</a> or posted <a href="/Company/About.aspx?x=wz_company_about_termsofuse&amp;menu=Awards">Legal Notice</a>, or to protect our services, web sites, customers, or others. </p>

<p>Wizards may collect personal information from users over 13 and under 18 ("teenager").

    </a>Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information </b>
</p>
<p>Wizards may collect and store personal information about children under 13 ("children" or "child") if it is submitted by way of our registration form and with the parent's or legal guardian’s verifiable consent. To determine who is younger than 13 years old and whether parental consent is required, we ask all users who wish to register to submit their date of birth. Those users that indicate they are under 13 years of age are directed to a Parental Consent Form. The Parental Consent Form is available for viewing <a href="https://accounts.wizards.com/Resource/COPPAForm.htm">here</a>, and it must be signed and returned to Wizards by mail or fax, before we will collect information from users who have indicated they are under 13. </p>
<p> If given verifiable permission from a parent or legal guardian, Wizards may collect and store the following types of personal information about a child under 13: name, e-mail address, mailing address, parent's or legal guardian's name, and parent's or legal guardian's email address. Wizards may also collect demographic information about a child such as the child's date of birth, gender, and other preferences; and, combine such information with the child's personal information. Wizards will only collect this information if it is voluntarily submitted to us by the child or parent/ legal guardian and provided with the parent's or legal guardian’s signed permission. We do not gather personal information about a child through the use of passive collection mechanisms such as cookies. For more information on how we use cookies and other information collection tools, please see our section on cookies (provided above).</p>
<p>The information that a child provides on his/her registration form may be used to: (a) allow the child to participate in activities on our web sites (e.g., contests); and, (b) allow us to send the child promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers, and other events of interest.</p>
<p>Wizards may share kids' personal information with outside entities hired to assist with internal website support operations (e.g., online product fulfillment, e-mail services, or technical support). These entities will not use kids' personal information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain confidentiality, surveys, security, and integrity of all the personal information they obtain from us.</p>
<p>We may also use the information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so that we can constantly improve the products and services we provide our visitors and to better meet their needs.</p>
<p>Please note that we are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. To read about the steps Wizards takes to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of children's personal information, please see our section on "Safeguarding your personal information" (above).</p>
<p>In some instances, certain portions of our web sites (e.g., electronic postcards) will allow children under 13 to submit personal information such as their e-mail addresses without first obtaining their parents' or legal guardians’ consent. Such portions of our web sites operate activities or provide services in a way that does not require prior parental consent under the law.</p>
