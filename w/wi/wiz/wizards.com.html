<h2 class="headline">WIZARDS WEB SITE PRIVACY STATEMENT</h2>
<h3 class="subheading"></h3>
<p align="right" class="byline"><i></i></p>
<p><i>Last modified June 30, 2002</i></p><a name="top"></a><h3>WELCOME! </h3>
<p>The Wizards of the Coast Web site brings you the coolest information about the world of Wizards and provides a first hand look at our games. If you are a parent or guardian and are interested in knowing more about Wizardâ€™s policy regarding the online collection of information from children, we recommend reviewing the <a href="#parents">Note To Parents</a> below. </p>
<p>Wizards respects the privacy rights of its online visitors and is committed to providing you with a secure online environment. We have adopted an Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") that guides how we collect, store and use the information you provide us online. </p>
<h3>What information does Wizards collect? </h3>
<p>Wizards wants to give you the most exciting Internet experience possible. To help us figure out what you like and don't like about our sites, we may ask for your opinion from time to time. Wizards may request and/or collect information from you on a voluntary basis when you:</p>
<ul><li>sign up for Wizards.Community</li>
<li>shop at one of our affiliate online stores </li>
<li>participate in contests, events or promotions</li>
<li>send questions or comments via e-mail to Wizards customer support</li>
<li>submit your resume to us online</li>
<li>fill out online surveys</li>
</ul>
<p>The requested information may include personal information such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, and home address. In addition, we may request demographic information such as your age, the gender and birth dates of children in your household, and toy and game ownership and preferences.</p>
<p>If you are under the age of 13, you will need your parent or guardian's consent before you can provide any personal information to us for purposes of registration and other online activities. Kids, if you are ever unsure about anything you are seeing on this site, ask your parent or guardian for help. See <a href="#parents">Note To Parents</a> below for more information. </p>
<ul><li><b>WIZARDS.COMmunity Chat, Bulletin Boards, and Mailing Lists</b><br> Since Wizards' free interactive community activities are moderated, registered members under 13 years of age may participate in such activities upon registration, unless their parent or guardian asks that their registration be disallowed. Personal information of registered users is not accessible by the public unless the member adds it to his or her User Information or is disclosed by the user themselves in a public post. </li>
<li><b>Online Stores </b><br> Visitors purchasing goods and services through one of our affiliate online store will need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to name, mailing address,phone number and e-mail address. </li>
<li><b>Promotions <br></b> To participate in some of our promotions, you may be asked to provide an e-mail address or screen name, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. Please do not use your real name for these promotions. For other Wizards promotions, we may request your name and home address in order to send you products or information by regular mail.</li>
<li><b>E-mail</b><br> By allowing you to send e-mail to us, we are not attempting to collect any personal information about you. We will only use personal information (such as name, mailing address and e-mail address) contained in your e-mail to respond to your specific inquiry or comments in the e-mail. Although we may retain your e-mail for a period of time, we will not use any personal information contained in your e-mail for any purpose other than responding to your specific inquiry or comments.<br> By allowing you to send postcards or pages to friends, we are not attempting to collect any personal information about you or the person you are e-mailing. We will use the personal information supplied (such as name and e-mail address) only to send the postcard or page as you request and allow the recipient to respond to you. </li>
<li><b>Resumes</b><br> Some of our sites allow for the online submission of resumes. Personal information collected from resumes will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings. This information may be shared within Wizards.</li>
<li><b>Online Surveys</b><br> In order to improve the user experience at our Web sites, we may employ online surveys for visitors to volunteer anonymous demographic information about themselves and provide us feedback about why they visit our sites and what we can do to make them better. Information collected through these surveys is anonymous; we cannot identify who is submitting the information or tie it to other personally identifiable information a user may have provided us through another means.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever the activity may be, we will only collect information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. If you do not want to submit personal information when requested, you will not be able to access certain areas on our site. However, you do not need to provide personal information to Wizards in order to use our Web sites.</p>
<h3>Who is collecting my information and how will it be used?</h3>
<p>Wizards collects the personal information you provide on our sites. We may use the information you submit to our Web sites to send you advertising or promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers and other events of interest. We may also use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and can better meet your needs. </p>
<p>The demographic information (e.g., age and gender) you provide us is collected by Wizards and may be disclosed in aggregate to third parties. This aggregate demographic information cannot be used to personally identify you or your computer. </p><a name="share"></a><h3>With whom does Wizards share my personal information?</h3>
<p>From time to time, Wizards may employ and share its customers' personal information with entities who use it solely to provide support for the internal operations of the Wizards website (e.g., online product fulfillment, email services, or technical support). These entities will not use your personal information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us.</p>
<p>We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.</p>
<p>Wizards, as a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc. does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose personal information collected from and about its users (including children under 13) to third parties. However, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, Wizardâ€™s customer information may be transferred to Wizardâ€™s successor or assign, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<h3>Cookies and IP Addresses</h3>
<p>Wizards uses "cookies" to enhance your experience at our Web sites. Cookies are pieces of information that we place on your computer to help us accurately understand how many consumers are visiting a particular site, how often they visit that site and what content they are most interested in viewing. For example, a cookie will allow us to remember certain things based on your Internet Protocol or "IP" address (an IP address is the string of numbers that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent across the Internet), such as the time and duration of your visits, how you navigated through our content and where you exited a particular site. </p>
<p>Wizards' website collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When visitors request pages on Wizards' website, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our community rules [<a href="/community/main.asp?x=onlineconduct">Code of Conduct</a>] or posted <a href="/company/WebSiteLegalNotice.asp">Legal Notice</a>, or to protect our service, site, customers, or others. </p>
<p>Some services within Wizards' website, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name, email address, and message. Please review each service prior to use and only use those that disclose information you are comfortable with sharing. </p>
<h3>Linking to third party sites</h3>
<p>To provide relevant information not found on our Web sites and to facilitate online shopping, Wizards may provide links from our Web sites to third party Web sites. Wizards will notify users when they are leaving a Wizards site and we encourage our users to read third party sites' privacy policies before submitting personal information.</p>
<h3>Opt-out</h3>
<p>If you do not want Wizards to send you e-mail or regular mail about our products and/or services, you can opt-out at the time of registration or at the time of information collection. If you are receiving e-mails or regular mail and at a later date you choose to opt-out and have your name removed from Wizardâ€™s e-mailing list, you can do so by using the link included with a Wizards e-mail or by sending an e-mail to webregistration@wizards.com.</p><a name="safeguard"></a><h3>Safeguarding your personal information</h3>
<p>Wizards will only collect personal information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, and we will take appropriate steps to ensure the security and integrity of any information you provide to us. Any information provided to us is housed in a secure datacenter, which can only be accessed via SecureID by Wizards personnel.</p>
<h3>Review, update and removal of personal information</h3>
<p>If you have registered with our site, you may at any time review and/or update the contact information we have for you or inform us that you want us to remove your information from our database by contacting us at webregistration@wizards.com. <i>Please be sure to include in your message the name of the site at which you registered and the e-mail address you used to register so that we can verify your request</i>.</p>
<h3>Questions and Complaints</h3>

<p>We reserve the right to change this statement at any time, so visit this page from time to time to check for changes. For additional information about our Web site, please see our <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/home/terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a> of Use.</p>
<p>Thanks. Have fun! </p><a name="parents"></a><h3 align="center">NOTE TO PARENTS </h3>
<p>Wizards has developed its Web site to be an enjoyable experience for children (and adults) of all ages. Wizards recognizes that some younger children may not understand some of the information contained on the Web site or how the site operates. That is the purpose of the Privacy Statement. Please discuss this statement with your children so that they will better understand how to use the site and the information they may be asked to provide. Wizards strongly believes that providing its visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the Web site will lead to informed choices and decisions about how to use the site, as well as protect its users' privacy. If you have any questions or comments about our policy, please contact us using the Contact Information provided below. For all other issues, please contact <a target="_blank" href="/leaving.asp?url=http://www.hasbro.com/pl/page.customer_care/dn/default.cfm&amp;origin=company_privacystatement">Customer Service</a>.</p>
<h3>Teenagers (Ages 13-17)</h3>
<p>Wizards may collect personal information from users over 12 and under 18 ("teenager"). When a Web user in this age category submits personal information, Wizards may request a parent or guardian's e-mail address to notify the parent or guardian of the teenager's activity. Personal information collected from these visitors is subject to the policies set forth above.</p>
<h3>Children Under 13</h3>
<p><b>Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information </b></p>
<p>Wizards may collect and store personal information about children under 13 ("children" or "child") if it submitted by way of our registration form and with the parent's verifiable consent. To determine who is younger than 13 years old and whether parental consent is required, we ask all users who wish to register to submit their date of birth. Those users that indicate they are under 13 years of age are directed to our Parental Consent Form. If given verifiable permission from a parent, Wizards may collect and store the following types of personal information about a child under 13: name, email address, mailing address, parent's or guardian's name, and parent's or guardian's email address. Wizards may also collect demographic information about a child such as the child's date of birth, gender, and other preferences; and, combine such information with the child's personal information. Wizards will only collect this information if it is voluntarily submitted to us by the child or parent and provided with the parent's signed permission. We do not gather personal information about a child through the use of passive collection mechanisms such as cookies. For more information on how we use cookies and other information collection tools, please see our section on cookies (provided above).</p>
<p>The information that a child provides on his/her registration form may be used to: (a) allow the child to participate in activities on our site (e.g., contests); and, (b) allow us to send the child promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers, and other events of interest. We may also use the information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so that we can constantly improve the products and services we provide our visitors and to better meet their needs. </p>
<p>Please note that we are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. To read about the steps Wizards takes to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of children's personal information, please see our section on <a href="#safeguard">"Safeguarding your personal information"</a> (above). </p>
<p>In some instances, certain portions of our site (e.g., electronic postcards) will allow children under 13 to submit personal information such as their e-mail address without first obtaining their parents' consent. Such portions of our site operate activities or provide services in a way that does not require prior parental consent under the law.</p>
