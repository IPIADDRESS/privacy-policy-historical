    Thank you for visiting Wizzley.com. Your privacy is important to us. As such, we provide this privacy statement explaining our 
    online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this site.
</p>

<br>
<h3>1. The Information We Collect</h3>
<p>
At our website you can post articles, buy advertising, copy articles and other content, post comments, subscribe to one of our 
services, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. In the course of these various offerings, we often seek to 
collect from you various forms of personal information. Examples of the types of personally identifiable information that may be 
collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and 
information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.
<br><br>
You may also be able to submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address 
to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit 
the recipient's name and address. Examples of the types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other 
people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.
<br><br>
At certain parts of our site, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to 
order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings.
<br><br>
We, our service providers, advertisers and partners may collect various types of non-personally identifiable information when you 
visit any of our sites. A representative list of the types of non-personally identifiable information we may collect include: 
current Internet protocol address and type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating 
system you are using, (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America 
Online, Earthlink), the web pages you have visited, the content you have accessed and the advertisements you have been shown 
and/or clicked on.
</p>

<br>
<h3>2. How We Use the Information</h3>
<p>
We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to 
respond to your inquiries about our offerings, to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of 
interest to you, to enforce the legal terms that govern your use of our sites, and/or for the purposes for which you provided 
the information.
<br><br>
We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when 
we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your 
account with us.
<br><br>
We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards. From time to time, we also 
may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them.
<br><br>
The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We 
use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, 
programs, or services.
<br><br>
If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a letter to our editors, comments sent to our authors, a posting to a blog 
or a discussion board), we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us.
<br><br>
We may on occasion combine information we collect through our sites with information that we collect from other sources.
<br><br>
We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our sites, 
to deliver more relevant marketing messages and advertisements and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We 
also may use this information to analyze usage of our sites, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.
</p>

<br>
<h3>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
<p>
We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order 
or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe 
it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving 
potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, to verify or enforce compliance with 
the policies governing our sites and applicable laws or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal 
requirements.
<br><br>
In addition, we may transfer personally identifiable information about you if we, or one of our business units, are acquired 
by, sold to, or merged with another entity.
<br><br>
Our agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information 
in a manner that is consistent with this privacy statement by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other 
than to carry out the services they are performing for us.
<br><br>
Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you 
that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this 
privacy statement.
<br><br>
We may disclose personally identifiable information to third parties whose practices are not covered by this privacy 
statement (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations) 
that want to market products or services to you. If a Wizzley.com shares personally identifiable information, it will 
provide you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses either at the point of submission of your personally 
identifiable information or prior to any such disclosure.
<br><br>
If you have signed up to receive our e-mails and prefer not to receive marketing information from this site, follow 
the "unsubscribe" instructions provided on any marketing e-mail you receive from this site.
<br><br>
To provide visitors with additional or more relevant product and service opportunities, we may share non-personally 
identifiable information with third parties.

<h3>4. Advertising Practices</h3>
<p>
This section describes certain of our advertising practices, such as the collection and use of information to deliver 
advertising. We, our service providers, advertisers or partners may collect various types of non-personally identifiable 
information when you interact with us or visit any of our sites. A representative list of the types of non-personally 
identifiable information that may be collected include: current Internet protocol address and type of browser you are 
using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac 
OS), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink), the web pages you have visited, 
the content you have accessed and the advertisements you have been shown and/or clicked on. The non-personally identifiable 
information collected may be combined with information from other sources and/or shared with third parties.
<br><br>
The non-personally identifiable information collected may be used to improve the design and content of our sites, and to 
enable us to personalize your Internet experience. This information may also be used to provide you with additional 
product and service opportunities and to make inferences about your interests in order to deliver more relevant marketing 
messages and advertisements. We also may use this information to analyze usage of our sites.
<br><br>
The practices described in this section are enabled by the technologies and relationships described in the "Cookies and 
Web Beacons" and "Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors" sections below.
</p>

<br>
<h3>5. Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
<p>

furnish a site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.
<br><br>

sites. We also may use cookies to help us offer you products, programs, or services that may be of interest to you and

<br><br>
We, our third party service providers, advertisers or our partners also may use cookies to manage and measure the 
performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through Wizzley.com and/or other networks or sites. 
This also helps us, our service providers and partners provide more relevant advertising. For more information 
regarding third-party ad servers, see "Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors"

<br><br>
