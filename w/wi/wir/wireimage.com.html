	<span class="helpLegalTxt">WireImage collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve our sites, to process your transactions, to provide customer service, to perform research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies, and to display content that is customized to your interests and preferences.
	<p>
	We also use your personal information to communicate with you.  We may send transaction-related communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, and purchase confirmations.  We may also send you surveys or marketing communications to inform you of new products or services, or other information that may be of interest.  If you do not wish to receive marketing communications, you may contact us as described below or follow the "unsubscribe" instructions included within each email communication.  Please keep in mind that, if you choose not to receive marketing communications, you will continue to receive transactional or account communications (e.g., confirmation emails and account balance statements).
	</p><p>
	Personal information collected by WireImage may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which WireImage or its affiliates maintain facilities, and by using our sites or services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.  WireImage abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.

	</p><p>
	We may also share your personal information with service providers who perform services on our behalf.  For example, we may hire other companies to handle the processing of payments, to provide data storage, to host websites, to fulfill orders and shipments, to assist in direct marketing, to conduct audits, etc.  Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to provide the service.  They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
	</p><p>
	Information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, or sale of the company and/or its assets, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.  We will notify you of such an occurrence as described in the "Changes to This Privacy Policy" section below.
	</p><p>
	We reserve the right to disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or protect the rights, property or safety of our company, employees, customers, or the public.<br>

	<span class="helpLegalTxt">WireImage uses "cookies" to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your online experience.  A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive.  Cookies contain information, including personal information, that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.  The information that cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit, your registration information, and your navigational and purchase history. 
	<p>
	Cookies offer you many conveniences.  They allow us to identify registered users when they return to the site so that they can retrieve previous image search results, access Lightboxes and Clipbins and view their previous invoices.  Cookies also save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information.
	</p><p>
	In some cases, our third-party service providers may use cookies on our sites.  We have no access to or control over these cookies.  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by WireImage only, and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.
	</p><p>
	You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.  Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.  If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of our sites and services that depend on cookies.
	</p><p>
	In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies, including single-pixel gifs (also known as web beacons) on our websites and in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters.  These tiny electronic images assist us in determining how many users have visited certain pages or opened messages or newsletters.  We do not use these images to collect personal information.<br>

	<span class="helpLegalTxt">The security of your personal information is important to us.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to help protect your personal information.  For instance, when you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.  Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
