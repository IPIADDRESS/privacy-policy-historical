			<h3>Privacy Statement</h3>
			<p>
				WireClub.com is continually committed to your privacy by both 
				safeguarding your personal information and enforcing a strict 
				policy of non-disclosure to third parties. Any updates to this 
				document will be emailed to all registered users who have not 
				opted out of email communication. 
			</p>

			<h3>Information automatically collected from visitors:</h3>
			<p>					
				We use your computer’s IP address (a unique number used to 
				identify your computer on the internet) to maintain statistics 
				and to identify potential problems. Your IP address is not tied 
				to your personal information in any way and can not be used to 
				identify you. 
			</p>

			<p>
				WireClub.com also uses a cookie (a small file stored on your machine) 
				to identify users once they have logged in and to optionally save 
				their password if they choose to. This use of cookies is very 
				common on the internet and is required to avoid having to log in 
				to every page you want to access.
			</p>

			<h3>Personal information provided by members:</h3>
			<p>					
				All personal information submitted as part of the registration 
				process is kept in our secure database and never disclosed to third 
				parties. Any information that is entered as part of a public profile 
				will be available to all visitors to the website but will never be given 
				to third parties as a bulk operation. We enforce our user’s right to 
				privacy and never publicize fields that are marked as private such as 
				your real name. Any field that has an opt-out option such as ‘prefer 
				not to say’ is up to the user to provide and will not deny access to 
				any part of the site.
