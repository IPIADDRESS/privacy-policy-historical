			<h1>WiredTree Privacy Agreement</h1>

<strong>Effective Date:</strong>
<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on September 14, 2010.<br>
The last update before that was on October 26, 2006.</p>

<h2>Our Commitment To Privacy</h2>
<p>Your privacy is important to WiredTree. To better protect your privacy we
provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the
choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
Additionally, WiredTree adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles as agreed to 
and set forth by the United States Department of Commerce and the European 
Union ("EU"), <a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor/"> http://export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.
To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our website.</p>

<p>WiredTree reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time.
Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective
immediately upon posting on-line at this location.  You acknowledge and
agree that it is your responsibility to review this site and this Policy
periodically and to be aware of any modifications. You may identify
whether WiredTree has revised this Privacy Policy by noting the "Effective
Date" above. Your continued use of the site after such modifications will
constitute your: (a) acknowledgment of the modified Policy; and (b)
agreement to abide and be bound by the modified Policy. If you do not
agree to these terms, please do not access or use this site.</p>

<h2>Types of Information Collected</h2>
<p>In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we collect two
types of information about our users: Personal Information and
Non-Personal Information.</p>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>When you order services through WiredTree, we request certain personally
identifiable information from you on our order form to us to allow us to
process your order, provide you with the services you order from us, and
to provide ongoing technical support for your account. You must provide
contact information (such as name, email, phone number, and address) and
financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). By
purchasing our services, you agree to provide and maintain accurate,
complete and updated information. Your personal information will be kept 
only as long as we need it for the purposes for which we collected it, 
or as permitted by law.</p>

<p>After you have ordered our services, we may be in communication with you
about your account. These communications are essential to our relationship
with you and to our ability to provide you with quality services that are
responsive to your needs. As a result, we may maintain information about
our communications with you for future use.</p>

<p>WiredTree shall only process Personal Information in a way that is 
compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or 
authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, 
WiredTree shall take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information 
is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.</p>

<h2>Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>

<p>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order
only to provide service to that order. We do not share this information
with outside parties except to the extent necessary to provide service. In
the event that this policy changes, we will provide you with an
opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit the disclosure of your
information to third parties for any purpose other than your ordering and
ongoing use of our services. For sensitive information, affirmative or 
explicit (opt in) choice will be given if the information is to be 
disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than previously 
authorized. </p>

<p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personal Information to others. We do
provide some of our services through contractual arrangements with
affiliates, services providers, partners and other third parties. We and
our service partners use your Personal Information to operate our sites
and to deliver our services. For example, we must release your credit card
information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and
services purchased on this site or release your address information to the
delivery service to deliver products that you ordered.</p>

<p>Occasionally, WiredTree may be required by law enforcement or judicial
authorities to provide Personal Information to the appropriate
governmental authorities. We will disclose Personal Information upon
receipt of a court order or subpoena or to cooperate with a law
enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement
agencies in identifying those who use WiredTree services for illegal
activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any
activities that WiredTree in good faith believe to be unlawful.</p>

<p>WiredTree may also use the Personal Information collected to contact
customers regarding important changes to our site, new services and
special offers we think you will find valuable.  You will be given the
opportunity to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers
through our client portal or by sending an email request at
legal@wiredtree.com.</p>
