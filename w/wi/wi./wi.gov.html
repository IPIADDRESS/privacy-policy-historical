<h5>What is a Cookie?</h5>
<p>
A cookie is a small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and may either be used only during your session (a "session" cookie) or may be stored on your computer's hard drive (a "persistent" cookie). Cookies can contain data about user movement during the visit to the website.
If your browser software is set to allow cookies, a web site can send its own cookie to you.  A web site that has set a cookie can only access those cookies it has sent to you, it cannot access cookies sent to you by other sites. 
</p>

<h5>Why are Cookies Used on Web Sites?</h5>
<p>
Cookies are one mechanism for maintaining continuity during a user's visit to a web site. They allow data to be maintained for users' benefit as they navigate a site.  This is referred to as "session" or "state management" cookie.  These cookies go away when you terminate your visit to the website as they are maintained only in your browser's active memory during your session.
Cookies may be also be stored on your computer to so that you can be recognized by a website on subsequent visits. They can be read by the website that set them whenever you enter the website.  They are often used on websites that require you to log in to save you entering all of your log-in information.  They may store information on your unique identifier and the areas of the website you have visited before. These cookies are stored on your computer's hard drive after you have left your website visit and consequently are often referred to as "persistent" cookies.
</p>

<h5>Choices about Cookies</h5>
<p>
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) 
</p>

<h5>Wisconsin.gov's Practices Regarding Cookies</h5>
<p>
Wisconsin.gov uses only session cookies.  The information on these cookies is retained by the State only while the user's session is active in a table that lists the unique identifiers of those currently using the site. Currently session states are set to 30 minutes maximum. Wisconsin. Gov is using cookies for the following purposes: <br><br>
- Support the rotation of the home page's banner and "Featured Site" graphic. Neither of these cookies are persistent and they contain no information about the user.  <br><br>
- When you "sign in" to the Employment section of Wisconsin.gov as either an employer or a job seeker. For job seekers, the cookie enables the session to be maintained as the user moves through different pages, such as updating a multi-page resume, previewing or showing the resume posted.  For employers, the cookies are used to establish the session state.
