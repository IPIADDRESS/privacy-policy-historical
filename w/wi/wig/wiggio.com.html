      <p class="wiggioH2">Sharing Your Information with Third Parties </p>
      
      <p class="P6"><span class="T1">Wiggio is about sharing information with the members of your groups.  We reserve the right to do the following:</span></p>
      <ul><li class="P15" style="margin-left:0cm;">
	  
	  <p class="P15" style="margin-left:0.25cm;"><span class="T3">We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about Wiggio, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, to offer an online job application process, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the Wiggio-specified purposes. </span></p></li>
	
	<li class="P16" style="margin-left:0cm;"><p class="P16" style="margin-left:0.25cm;"><span class="T3">We occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse into the Wiggio world. Such accounts have only limited capabilities (e.g., messaging is disabled) and passwords are changed regularly to limit possible misuse. </span></p></li>
	
	<li class="P16" style="margin-left:0cm;"><p class="P16" style="margin-left:0.25cm;"><span class="T3">We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Wiggio service or using the Wiggio name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies. </span></p></li>
	
	<li class="P16" style="margin-left:0cm;"><p class="P16" style="margin-left:0.25cm;"><span class="T3">We may offer services jointly with other companies on Wiggio. You can tell when another company is involved in any store or service provided on Wiggio, and we may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that store or service. </span></p></li>
	
	<li class="P17" style="margin-left:0cm;"><p class="P17" style="margin-left:0.25cm;"><span class="T3">If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Wiggio business, or individual business units owned by Wiggio, Inc., were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</span></p></li>

      <p class="wiggioH2">Third Party Advertising </p>
      
      <p class="P6"><span class="T1">Advertisements that appear on Wiggio are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. Wiggio does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on Wiggio unless you choose to share it with them.</span></p>
