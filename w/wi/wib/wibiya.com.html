                                <b>3. Additional Information about the Wibiya application and web toolbar platform</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We operate the Wibiya application and web toolbar platform (the "Wibiya Platform"), which ads functionality to Publishers. If you are reading this policy, you are probably familiar with our web toolbar (collectively, the "Wibiya bar") that Publishers place on their websites.<br>The previous Sections also apply to the use of the Wibiya Platform. However, this Section is intended to clarify certain aspects with regard to the collection, usage and sharing of your information as part of the Wibiya platform. 
                            </p>
                             <p>
                                <u>(a) The Information We Gather and How We Use It:</u>
                            </p>
                            <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                                <li>
                                    <b>Personal Information -</b> If you are accessing the Site or Services as a Publisher, you may provide your email address when you register the Publisher on the Site and create a user name and password. Any choices you make, information you voluntarily provide us or data we gather and provide to you in analytics reports about the use of the Wibiya Platform on the Publisher's website is the Publisher's Personal Information. In addition, we include the user name you have chosen in the Wibiya code the Publisher places on its website, which enables us to associate analytics data with the Publisher's account. For this reason, you may wish to choose a user name that does not include your personal name and information, as the Publisher website's code is publicly viewable.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Anonymous Information - </b>When you, an End User, download a page that uses the Wibiya Platform, our server logs collect your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, and the date and time of your request. We use this information to improve our internal operations and software. In addition to log files, when a page containing the Wibiya Platform is downloaded, we may also set Cookies. Without knowing who you are, our Cookies may record information about how you use the web, for example, the websites and webpages you have visited, web searches that landed you on a page of interest, categories of interest, and if and how often you share content with others using the Wibiya platform. We may use this information to customize different types of functionality of the Wibiya bar or application that is triggered through the Wibiya. If you elect to block or delete Cookies, you may not be able to enjoy certain personalized features of our Service.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><u> (b) Information Sharing</u></p>
                            <p>
                                We share the information we collect through the Wibiya platform in the same way described in "Our Site and Services" Section above. In addition, we may assist our advertising partners in setting cookies so that we can share all or some of the Anonymous Information with them. Our advertising partners use the Anonymous Information to deliver targeted advertising. Please see the section below on Choice if you do not want us to share information with our advertising partners. To be clear the Anonymous Information provided to our advertising partners does not contain any Personal Information of End Users or any information that can be associated with any Publisher or Publisher domain.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <u> (c) Choice</u>
                            </p>
                            <p>As noted above, we may have helped our advertising partners set Cookies. In order to ensure that no additional information is collected by these Cookies for the purpose of delivering targeted advertising, you can clear all of your Cookies as provided in your browser's instructions. You can also opt-out from other network advertising from the opt-out page of the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a>.</p>
                            <p>Finally, we allow Publishers to prohibit us from collecting information about their End Users.</p>
                            <p><b>4. Information security</b></p>
                            <p>We take reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>
                            <p>We restrict access to Personal Information to Wibiya employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, if they fail to meet these obligations. Despite these measures, you should know that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information and mistakes may happen.</p>
                            <p><b>5. Children</b></p>
                            <p>We do not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from individuals who are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site or Services are designed to attract people under the age of 13. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. If we obtain knowledge that a user is under the age of 13, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases.</p>
                            <p><b>6. Links to Other Sites</b>
                            </p><p>Our Site and Services contain applications from and to third party websites and services. The fact that we link to a website or service or allow you to use the application is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. This privacy policy applies only as provided in the scope section above. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information.</p>
