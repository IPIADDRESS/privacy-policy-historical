                                We operate the Wibiya application and web toolbar platform (the "Wibiya Platform"), which ads functionality to publishers. If you are reading this policy, you are probably familiar with our web toolbar (collectively, the "Wibiya bar") that Publishers place on their websites. This section describes how we collect, use and share your information as part of the Wibiya platform.

                                    <b>Personal Information -</b> If you are accessing the Site or Services on behalf of a Publisher, you may provide your email address when you register the Publisher on the Site and create a user name and password. Any choices you make, information you knowingly provide us or data we gather and provide to you in analytics reports about the use of the Wibiya Platform on the Publisher's website is the Publisher's Personal Information. In addition, we include the user name you have chosen in the Wibiya code the Publisher places on its website, which enables us to associate analytics data with the Publisher's account. For this reason, you may wish to choose a user name that does not include your personal name and information, as the Publisher website's code is publicly viewable.
                                </li>

We use this information to improve our internal operations and software. In addition to log files, when a page containing the Wibiya platfom is downloaded, we may also set Cookies. Without knowing who you are, our Cookies may record information about how you use the web, for example, the websites and webpages you have visited, web searches that landed you on a page of interest, categories of interest, and if and how often you share content with others using the Wibiya platform. We may use this information to customize different types of functionality of the Wibiya bar or application that is triggered through the Wibiya.

                            <p><u> (b) Information Sharing</u></p>
                            <p>We share the information we collect through the Wibiya platform in the same way described in Our Site and Services section above.

Our advertising partners use the Anonymous Information to deliver targeted advertising. Please see the section below on Choice if you do not want us to share information with our advertising partners. To be clear the Anonymous Information provided to our advertising partners does not contain any Personal Information of End Users or any information that can be associated with any Publisher or Publisher domain. </p>
                            <p><u> (c) Choice</u></p>
                            <p>As noted above, we may have helped our advertising partners set cookies.

Despite these measures, you should know that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information and mistakes may happen.</p>
                            <p><b>Children</b></p>

Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. If we obtain knowledge that a user is under the age of 13, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases. </p>
