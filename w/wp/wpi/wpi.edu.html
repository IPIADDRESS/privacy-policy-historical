<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>



<div class="callout">
<h2 class="callout">Student Information</h2>
<p>Student information is protected
by the <b>Federal Family Educational Rights &amp; Privacy Act
(FERPA)</b>.  Parents and students should read <a href="/Admin/Registrar/ferpa.html">WPI's FERPA Compliance Statement</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) has created this privacy statement
in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the <em>privacy of visitors
to our Web site</em>.  The following discloses our information gathering and
dissemination practices for this Web site (www.wpi.edu).</p>

<p><em>Collection &amp; Use of Personal Information</em><br>
Many of the forms on our site require visitors to give us contact
information (like their name and email address), unique identifiers
(like their social security number), and demographic information (like
their zip code, age, or income level).  We use information from registration forms to send each visitor information about our
University.  This information is also used to contact the visitor
when necessary.</p>

<p>Registered users of our <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi">Admissions
Café</a> and <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/cgi-bin/Alumni/Ubb/ultimatebb.cgi">Alumni Café</a>, may receive e-mail messages
from time to time from our staff - users can choose to opt out of
these mailings by going into the Café and editing their profile
to be left off the mailing list.  Unique identifiers (such as social
security numbers) are collected only to verify the user's identity
internally.</p>

<p>Demographic and profile data is also collected through some of our
web forms.  We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our
site, showing them content in which we think they might be interested,
and displaying the content according to their preferences.</p>

<p><em>IP Logging</em><br>When a visitor sends us email via our forms,
such as our <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/cgi-bin/feedback">Feedback Form</a>, we
collect that person's <i>IP address</i> (the unique identifier of
a computer on the Internet) and use it to help us diagnose problems
with our server.  In fact, a majority of our webforms collect and pass
along the sender's IP address to the recipient of the email generated
by the form.</p>

<p><em>Cookies</em><br>
In some areas of our Web site, including, but not limited to the <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi">Admissions
Café</a> and <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/cgi-bin/Alumni/Ubb/ultimatebb.cgi">Alumni Café</a>, we use cookies to save a
visitor's password so it
doesn't have to be re-entered each time that person visits our site.
Our campus portal, <a href="http://my.wpi.edu/">myWPI</a>, uses
temporary cookies to maintain login sessions; these cookies do not
contain personal information and are deleted from the users's computer
upon leaving the system.</p>

<p><em>Confidentiality</em><br>
All of the data collected via our web forms is confidential and
internal to employees of the University.  <em>At no time will WPI sell
or otherwise distribute to parties external to WPI the contact
information or demographic data collected via its Web site.</em></p>

<p><em>Reporting Violations of this Privacy Statement</em><br>
This site contains links to other sites, including the personal
Web sites of WPI faculty, staff, and students.  WPI is not responsible
for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.  Visitors who observe personal sites on the WPI server which violate copyright laws and/or the <a href="/Pubs/Policies/AUP/">WPI Acceptable Use Policy</a> should immediately report
such activity to <a href="mailto:webmaster@wpi.edu">webmaster@wpi.edu</a>.</p>


<p><em>Public Forums</em><br>
This site makes use of discussion forums, such as the <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi">Admissions
Café</a> and Alumni Café, the contents of which are
accessible to users of the
Internet.  <em>Please remember that any information that is disclosed in
these areas becomes public information</em> and you should exercise caution
when deciding to disclose your personal information.</p>



<p><em>Security</em><br>
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss,
misuse and alteration of the information under our control.  Certain
portions of the WPI Web site are restricted by domain to members of the
WPI community only.  Still other pages may require users to enter
their username and password.  These pages are intended for internal
use only, and generally require the CCC UNIX username and password
offered to all faculty, staff and students.</p>


<p><em>Choice/Opt-Out</em><br>
Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
communications from us at the point where we request information about
the visitor.</p>

<p>This site gives users the following options for removing their
information from our database to not receive future communications or
to no longer receive our service.</p>
