<blockquote>
<p>Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) has created this privacy statement
in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of visitors
to our website.  The following discloses our information gathering and
dissemination practices for this website (www.wpi.edu).</p>

<p><b>Collection &amp; Use of Personal Information</b><br>
Many of the forms on our site require visitors to give us contact
information (like their name and email address), unique identifiers
(like their social security number), and demographic information (like
their zip code, age, or income level).  We use information from registration forms to send each visitor information about our
University.  This information is also used to contact the visitor
when necessary.</p>

<p>Registered users of our <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/cgi-bin/ubb/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro">Admissions
Café</a>, may receive email messages from time to time from our
Admissions staff - users can choose to opt out of these mailings by
going into the Café and editing their profile to be left off
the mailing list.  Unique identifiers (such as social security numbers)
are collected only to verify the user's identity internally.</p>

<p>Demographic and profile data is also collected through some of our
web forms.  We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our
site, showing them content in which we think they might be interested,
and displaying the content according to their preferences.</p>


<p><b>IP Logging</b><br>When a visitor sends us email via our <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/cgi-bin/feedback">Feedback Form</a>, we
collect that person's <i>IP address</i> (the unique identifier of
a computer on the Internet) and use it to help us diagnose problems with our server.  In fact, a majority of our webforms collect and pass along the sender's IP address to the recipient of the email generated by the form.</p>

<p><b>Cookies</b><br>
In some areas of our website, including, but not limited to the <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/cgi-bin/ubb/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro">Admissions
Café</a>, we use cookies to save a visitor's password so it
doesn't have to be re-entered each time that person visits our site.</p> 

<p><b>Confidentiality</b><br>
All of the data collected via our web forms is confidential and
internal to employees of the University.  <b>At no time will WPI sell
or otherwise distribute to parties external to WPI the contact
information or demographic data collected via its website.</b></p> 

<p><b>Reporting Violations of this Privacy Statement</b><br>

<p><b>Public Forums</b><br>

Café</a>, the contents of which are accessible to users of the
Internet.  <b>Please remember that any information that is disclosed in
these areas becomes public information</b> and you should exercise caution
when deciding to disclose your personal information.</p>

misuse and alteration of the information under our control.  Certain
portions of the WPI website are restricted by domain to members of the
WPI community only.  Still other pages may require users to enter
their username and password.  These pages are intended for internal
use only, and generally require the CCC UNIX username and password

pages is available to members of the WPI community <a href="safe.html">here</a>.</p>


<p><b>Choice/Opt-Out</b><br>
Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
communications from us at the point where we request information about
