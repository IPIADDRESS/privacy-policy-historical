information<br>&nbsp;<br>Your Personal Information is used to manage Your 
Account and is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated 
otherwise or in special circumstances. In compliance with applicable laws, it is 
our policy to require only the Personal Information necessary to manage Your 
Account and enable You to participate in our programs (as applicable, the 
“Program”). WPVideoMagic.com does not condition Your participation in any 
specific activity on our Site on the disclosure of more information than is 
reasonably necessary. <br>&nbsp;<br>Traffic Data<br>WPVideoMagic.com may also 
use certain web technologies such as “cookies” to track Your use of our Site. 
Your browser may have an option that allows You to reject cookies, but doing so 
may limit Your use of our Site.&nbsp; Usage Information is anonymous and does 
not personally identify You.&nbsp; In addition, WPVideoMagic.com may use web 
beacons or other tools to measure the effectiveness of, and otherwise manage, 
our online advertising.&nbsp; These web beacons enable our advertising server to 
recognize You when You visit the Site and to determine which banner ads bring 
users to the Site.&nbsp; WPVideoMagic.com does not use spyware, adware or any 
other similarly intrusive software.&nbsp; The Usage Information that 
WPVideoMagic.com collects depends on how You choose to use this Site.

or providing You with voluntary customer surveys to helps us to improve the 
types of products and services we offer to You.&nbsp; In addition, 
WPVideoMagic.com may use Traffic Data to deliver tailored advertisements or 
joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us 
the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the 
audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have 
collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to the intended 
audience. Additionally, WPVideoMagic.com may share non-identifying and aggregate 
information (except as described above), but not Personal Information, with 
third parties to administer certain co-branded products or services. 
WPVideoMagic.com does not share Your Personal Information with these advertisers 
or joint venture companies unless You have provided Your permission beforehand. 
In these instances, You will be notified before any such data is collected or 
transferred and may decide not to use that particular service or feature. 
Finally, WPVideoMagic.com may take the information collected in response to 
customer surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other 
customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as 
gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or 
other demographic information). This aggregated, non-personally identifying 
information may be shared with third parties.<br>&nbsp;<br>Third Party
