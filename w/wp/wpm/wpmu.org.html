				<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Incsub we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<p>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We too don’t like services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</p>
<p>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</p>
<p>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</p>
<p>In our service, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</p>
<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals. This privacy policy covers all Incsub services, including <a href="http://wpmudev.com">WPMU DEV</a>, <a href="http://campuspress.com">CampusPress</a>, and <a href="http://edublogs.org">Edublogs</a>.</p>
<p>If you have questions about accessing or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.</p>
<p>It is Incsub’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Incsub collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Incsub’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Incsub’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Incsub may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Incsub also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Incsub.org blogs. Incsub only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Incsub’s websites choose to interact with Incsub in ways that require Incsub to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Incsub gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at Edublogs.org to provide a username and in some cases, an email address. WPMU DEV customers are asked to provide a first name, email address, and username. In each case, Incsub collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Incsub. Incsub does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Incsub may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Incsub may monitor the most popular blogs on the Incsub site or use spam screened by our filters to help identify spam. Incsub may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Incsub does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Incsub discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Incsub’s behalf or to provide services available at Incsub’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Incsub’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Incsub will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Incsub discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Incsub believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Incsub, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Incsub website and have supplied your email address, Incsub may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Incsub and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Incsub takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<p>We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>Incsub, LLC acknowledges that all individuals have the right to access the personal information/data that we maintain about them. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct his query to admin@incsub.com. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe, not to exceed one week.</p>
<p>If we ever were to engage in any onward transfers of your data with third parties for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized, we would provide you with an opt-out choice to limit the use and disclosure of your personal data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Incsub uses cookies to help Incsub identify and track visitors, their usage of Incsub website, and their website access preferences. Incsub visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Incsub’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Incsub’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h3>Ads</h3>
<p>All Incsub properties are 100% advertising free.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Incsub may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Incsub’s sole discretion. Incsub will notify clients by email when making changes.</p>
