<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you visit WeCustomers.com, you provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us, and website use information collected by us as you interact with the WeCustomers.com website. When you register with WeCustomers.com, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name and email address.
