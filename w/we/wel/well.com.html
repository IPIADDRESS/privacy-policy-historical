<a name="privacy"><font size="5" face="TIMES,SERIF">WELL Privacy Policy</font><br><br>

The WELL respects your right to the privacy of the personal information
you provide us.  We are a non-anonymous community site.  We ask members
to make their real names known to each other when logged in to our
system and communicating with one another. We seek to provide this
non-anonymous social environment while treating your privacy with
respect and care.
<br><br>
To that end, unless you designate otherwise or we state otherwise in
this policy or at the time information is collected, with the exception
of using your real name as described, any personal information you
provide to The WELL will be known only to two parties: you and the
staffs of The WELL and our parent company, Salon.com. Your name will be
available to other members for purposes of community participation.
However, we will not disclose the fact of your membership by name to
non-members without your permission, except in specific situations such 
as to law enforcement agencies as specified in this document.
<br><br>
The following policy is intended to explain how your personal
information will be treated as you make use of our sites and their
features. Personal information includes your street and off-WELL e-mail
addresses, billing information, click-through and usage activity and 
any other personal information you may provide at the behest of The WELL. 
This policy may change from time to time, with announcement and discussion
in the WELL forum area known as the Policy Conference (go there by
typing: <b>g policy</b>). Please check there periodically.
<br><br>

</a><a name="announcements"><font size="5" face="TIMES,SERIF">Announcements and spam</font><br><br>

At the time of registering for their memberships, WELL subscribers
receive a short series of orientation emails from The WELL.  From time
to time, members may receive notification of new services, changes to
policies or price adjustments.  We will not send you other email at
the address you provide, except for infrequent communications to
resolve issues that may arise with your own WELL account.  More routine
announcements are made in the WELL Newsletter Conference (<b>g news</b>)
rather than via email.
<br><br>
We will not sell, rent or give your email address to any third party.
If you choose an account without a WELL email address, the email address
you provide when you register with The WELL will be visible to other
WELL members so that they may communicate privately with you. You are
free at any time to substitute an alternate e-mail address if you wish
to keep the one you initially registered private.  We do not permit 
the use of WELL email accounts for sending unsolicited bulk 
commercial email.
<br><br>

</a><a name="traffic"><font size="5" face="TIMES,SERIF">Traffic data</font><br><br>

Each time a visitor comes to The WELL's servers, including the shell
host, mail machines or our Web sites, our servers -- like most on the 
Web -- collect some basic technical information, including, for example,
the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from
aol.com or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we may record the
address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to a
WELL Web site) and Web browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape 
browser on a Macintosh platform).
<br><br>
We also count, track and aggregate each visitor's activity into our
analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where
traffic comes from, how traffic differs within conferences, etc.). To
these ends, we may merge information about membership levels and
activity into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated
basis with investors or the public; but we will not disclose your
individual identity as a WELL member nor discuss your personally
identifiable data without your permission. When we do present any form
of aggregated information to outside parties, no one will be able to
identify you or contact you. We do not release aggregated data for
individual WELL Private Conferences.
<br><br>

</a><a name="cookies"><font size="5" face="TIMES,SERIF">Use of cookies at The WELL</font><br><br>

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a
Web server and stored in your computer's memory or written on your 
computer's hard drive. We use session cookies, non-peristant files which 
vanish when you shut down your browser, to allow the system to know you 
have already entered a password each time you click for more data in 
a conference login session.  Our cookies do not contain any of the 
personal information you have provided to us.  We use cookies for our 
Web conferencing interface, not for telnet access to conferences.
<br><br>
We do not use cookies to track usage on our site, but the conferencing
software itself tracks what you have seen in order to show you new
material when you return.   This information about when you were last
present is available to other members of the system in the forums to
which you have mutual access so that it is easier to tell who is up to
date in a group conversation.  We never provide this information on
your activity to non-participants. 
<br><br>

</a><a name="participants"><font size="5" face="TIMES,SERIF">Participants
</font><br><br>

WELL members are expected to comply with our Member Agreement, but we
cannot control third parties' use of information you may choose to
provide via WELL forums or your user home page, nor can we vouch for
the integrity of the participants you may communicate with, including
but not limited to participants in Private Conference areas.  Sharing
information with other WELL members is a matter of individual choice
and judgement. If you choose to take part in any WELL conference, whatever 
you may disclose in that discussion area is made known to others who may
read the conference.
<br><br>

</a><a name="billing"><font size="5" face="TIMES,SERIF">WELL Billing Information</font><br><br> 

In order to subscribe, members provide The WELL with personal
information including a telephone number, billing street address
and credit card information. The WELL goes to great lengths to 
keep all such information strictly confidential and does not reuse, resell 
or redistribute it in any way.  This information is not available to 
other WELL subscribers unless you disclose it.  The email address with
which you register is not made available to others if you have a WELL
email address, nor if you provide an alternate off-site email address for 
member contact by changing your settings after registration. 
<br><br>

</a><a name="survey"><font size="5" face="TIMES,SERIF">Surveys</font><br><br>

The WELL will from time to time conduct voluntary surveys of visitors
to the site to obtain aggregate preferences and demographic information
about them.  Such information will be compiled and may be shared in the
aggregate to discuss business opportunities with third parties, but 
no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific 
individuals who participate in surveys.  
<br><br> 

</a><a name="children"><font size="5" face="TIMES,SERIF">Our commitment to children's privacy</font><br><br>
 
 Protecting the privacy of the very young is important to us. For that
 reason, we do not collect or maintain information at our sites from
 those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our sites are
 structured to attract anyone under 13.
<br><br> 

</a><a name="other"><font size="5" face="TIMES,SERIF">Other disclosure of personal information
</font><br><br>
 
 The WELL will not otherwise use or disclose your personal information
 without your consent except (i) as described in this privacy policy, or
 (ii) as required by law.  Any subscriber whose information is sought
 in accordance with this policy will be advised of the inquiry as soon 
 as practical.  Notification of such inquiries will be emailed to members
 before disclosures are made, unless notification is prohibited by law.
<br><br>
 This privacy policy may not protect information you voluntarily 
 disclose to others via a post to any online conference, email list, chat 
 or send tool or any other communication environment within or from our 
 service.
<br><br> 

</a><a name="cancellation"><font size="5" face="TIMES,SERIF">Cancellation and data removal policies
</font><br><br>
 
 If you would like to end your membership and to delete any data we are
 not required to retain for accounting purposes, you can close your
 account and request data removal from helpdesk@well.com.  If you wish to
 delete any of your own posts before ending your membership you may do so.
<br><br> 

</a><a name="sites"><font size="5" face="TIMES,SERIF"> Other sites
</font><br><br>
 
 The WELL contains many links to other Internet sites. We cannot control 
 and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of
 other Web sites, even if those sites are produced by WELL members
 or reside within our www.well.com/user area.
<br><br> 

</a><a name="info"><font size="5" face="TIMES,SERIF">Who can I ask if I have any additional
questions?
</font><br><br>
 
 If you have any further questions or concerns about The WELL's privacy
 policies and use of personal information, please send them to
 helpdesk@well.com, or post them to the WELL Policy Conference (The
 shortcut is <b>g policy</b>)
