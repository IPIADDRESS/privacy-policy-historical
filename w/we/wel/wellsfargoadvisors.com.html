<div style=" margin-left: 20px;">

                    <p>By law, information that is derived from your transactions and experiences
with us may be shared among the Wells Fargo and Wachovia companies (a) for
purposes other than direct marketing, and (b) unless you instruct us otherwise,
for direct marketing purposes.</p>


                    <p>If you choose to limit information sharing, we will not share personal
financial information about you among affiliates (other than information
derived from your transactions and experiences with Wells Fargo and Wachovia
companies) for any purpose, except as permitted by law. In addition, if you
select that option, we will limit affiliates' use of transaction, experience
and other personal financial information about you for direct marketing
purposes. However, your choice regarding the use of certain information for
marketing purposes does not apply to any Wells Fargo or Wachovia company that
has an existing business relationship with you or where the use is otherwise
permitted by law. To opt out of information sharing and marketing, use one of
the methods described below. Your election will apply until you tell us to
change your choice.</p>


                    <strong>Telephone and mail preferences.</strong>
                    <br>

                    <p class="nearhead">In addition to information sharing preferences, you may
request that we not contact you for marketing purposes by telephone. For
consumer accounts, this election will be effective while you are an active
client or a minimum of five years. For business accounts, this election will be
effective for five years from the date the election is received. You may also
request that we not contact you for marketing purposes by mail. For all
accounts, this election will be effective for three years.</p>


                    <strong>Communicate your information sharing, telephone and mail preferences in
any of the following ways:</strong>
                    <br>

                    <div style=" margin-left: 20px;">Call Wells Fargo Advisors at
1-877-358-1114.<br>
Visit a Wells Fargo or Wells Fargo Advisors office.</div>

                </div>


                <p>Your preferences will apply to you only - unless you tell us that they also
apply to other individuals listed on your accounts.</p>


                <div style=" margin-left: 20px;">
                    <strong>Do Not Call Policy:</strong> This
Privacy Policy constitutes Wells Fargo and Wachovia's Do Not Call Policy under
the Telephone Consumer Protection Act for all consumers. Wells Fargo and
Wachovia maintain an internal Do Not Call preference list. Do Not Call requests
will be honored within 30 days and will be effective for at least five years
from the date of request. No telemarketing calls will be made to residential or
cellular phone numbers that appear on the Wells Fargo and Wachovia Do Not Call
list. 

<p>Please note that if you choose to receive solicitations by mail or any other
channel you may continue to receive marketing information about Wells Fargo and
Wachovia products or services in regular account mailings and statements, when
you visit us online or at an ATM. You may also be contacted to service your
account or conduct surveys. If you have an assigned financial advisor or team,
they may continue to contact you to assist you in managing your portfolio or
relationship.</p>


                    <strong>When Financial Advisors Leave Wells Fargo Advisors</strong>
                    <br>
Wells Fargo Advisors recognizes that your relationship with your financial
advisor is important. If your financial advisor's affiliation with Wells Fargo
Advisors ends and he or she joins a non-affiliated securities broker-dealer
with which Wells Fargo Advisors has entered into an agreement regarding the
movement of financial advisors between firms, Wells Fargo Advisors will permit
the financial advisor to use certain client contact information to solicit
clients to join the financial advisor's new firm. The client contact
information that the financial advisor may use is limited to your name,
address, email address, phone number and account title. 

<p>If your financial advisor is affiliated with Wells Fargo Advisors Financial
Network, LLC (WFAFN) and the financial advisor's relationship with WFAFN is
terminated, your WFAFN financial advisor will also be permitted to retain
originals or copies of all client and account documentation for the purpose of
continuing the relationship with you and servicing your account through the
financial advisor's new firm. Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC will
also retain your client and account documentation.</p>

        <h2>Tips To Help You Protect Your Personal Information</h2>


        <ul class="bullets">

            <li>Carry only necessary information with you. Leave your Social Security card

of mail theft.</li>

nationwide consumer credit reporting companies. To learn more or request a copy
