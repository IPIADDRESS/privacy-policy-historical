                  Our Commitment to Privacy <br>
                  <br>
                  Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy 
                  we provide this policy to explain our information practices 
                  and the choices you can make about the way your information 
                  is collected and used on the www.welchs.com website. To make 
                  this Policy easy to find, we make it available on our homepage 
                  and at every point where personally identifiable information 
                  may be requested. 
                  
                  <p><br>
                    The Information We Collect </p>
                  <p> Welch's will not collect any personally-identifiable 
                    information about you through our website unless you provide 
                    it to us voluntarily. This policy applies to all information 
                    collected or submitted on the Welch's website. On some pages, 
                    you can make requests, register to receive materials or enter 
                    promotions. The types of personal information collected include: 
                    name, address, e-mail address, phone number, gender, permission 
                    to contact the person completing the registration, number 
                    of children in the household, if the registrant is a Welch's 
                    consumer or not, and general questions relating to product 
                    preferences or areas of interest on our website. We also collect 
                    the age of anyone who attempts to register this personally 
                    identifiable information on our site. We do this in order 
                    to fully comply with the rules and regulations under the Children's 
                    Online Privacy Protection Act to obtain parental consent for 
                    our visitors under the age of 13. </p>
                  <p>The Way We Use Information</p>
                  
                  <p>In order to participate in any promotional activities (such 
                    as a sweepstakes) or request a coupon from Welch's or 
                    partake in certain other activities offered only within a 
                    members-only section within www.welchs.com, called "My 
                    Grapelink", a complete and approved registration record 
                    is required. Any area outside of the "My Grapelink" 
                    area of welchs.com is open to all visitors of the website.</p>
                  <p>We will use the information collected on the Welch's 
                    website to (a) allow registered users to access the "My 
                    Grapelink" section; (b) communicate with those registered 
                    users who have authorized Welch's to contact them to 
                    provide updates about our products and promotions; (c) develop 
                    new marketing and product ideas; and (d) notify sweepstakes 
                    winners of what they have won.</p>
                  <p>Information provided by registration or through a survey 
                    may be used internally by us to improve the design of our 
                    website, to increase our understanding of our consumers and 
                    their product preferences, and for other marketing and promotional 
                    purposes. For example, we may study responses relating to 
                    the perceptions or flavor preferences of our products by consumers. 
                    These learnings may then be used to shape future marketing 
                    decisions by us.</p>
                  <p>Welch's also collects aggregate, non-personally-identifiable 
                    information on users by recording the IP address from the 
                    computers of visitors to welchs.com. An IP address is a number 
                    that is assigned to your computer when you surf the Web. Web 
                    servers, or the computers that provide the web pages to your 
                    computer for you to view, automatically identify your computer 
                    by its IP address. When you use your computer to request to 
                    view a page from a server, your IP address is logged by that 
                    server. Welch's does not link IP addresses to anything 
                    personally identifiable. Your visit to welchs.com will be 
                    logged; however, you will remain anonymous to us. We track 
                    the number of people that view each page of our website to 
                    better understand which features are most popular and best 
                    meet the needs of our visitors.</p>
                  
                  <p>Welch's will not sell or rent your personally identifiable 
                    information to anyone. Welch's will send personally identifiable 
                    information about you to other companies or people when:</p>
                  <p> 
                  </p><ul>
                    <li> We have your consent to do so.</li>
                    <li>We need to share the information in order to provide the 
                      product or service you have requested.</li>
                    <li>We need to send the information to companies who work 
                      on behalf of Welch's to provide a product or service 
                      for you on our behalf. Examples include hosting and helping 
                      to run this Web site, delivering packages, sending postal 
                      mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer 
                      lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and 
                      providing customer service. Unless we tell you differently, 
                      these companies do not have any right to use the personally 
                      identifiable information we provide to them beyond what 
                      is necessary to assist us, unless they have your consent 
                      to do so. </li>
                    <li>We need to respond to valid legal process. This includes 
                      a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, and any other 
                      instance when we believe we are required to do so by law. 
                      We may also make disclosures to protect your safety during 
                      emergencies if your physical safety is believed to be at 
                      risk, to protect the security or integrity of the Welch's 
                      Web site, or to take precautions against liability. We will 
                      take reasonable steps to limit the scope of these disclosures. 
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when 
                    information about you might go to third parties, and you will 
                    have an opportunity to choose not to share the information 
                    (opt-out). </p>
                  <p>Welch's may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable 
                    information about our users with other companies for marketing 
                    and promotional purposes. </p>
                  <p>If you do not register with welchs.com, but only provide 
                    us with your e-mail address in connection with contacting 
                    Welch's by e-mail, we will use your e-mail addresses 
                    to answer your e-mail. If you authorize Welch's to contact 
                    you, we may use your e-mail address to send you notice of 
                    values and promotions, such as coupon offerings and sweepstakes.

                    Use of Cookies</p>
                  <p>Welch's website uses cookies to customize the visits 
                    of consumers to the "My Grapelink" section within 
                    the welchs.com website. Cookies are messages given to a Web 
                    browser (a software program that resides on your computer 
                    and allows you to surf the Web) by a Web server when the Web 
                    browser requests to "see" pages on a Web site. The 
                    browser stores the message from the server and sends it back 
                    to the server each time the browser requests to see a page 
                    from that server.</p>
                  <p>The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find

                    You always have the option to set the browser on your computer

                    users and prepare customized web pages for them to view. For 
                    example, you may receive a welcome message that includes your

                    retrieve the information that was voluntarily provided by 
                    you to help improve your user experience or speed up your

                  <p>Welch's is committed to doing its part to protect the

                  <p>The following sections of our Privacy Policy explain how 
                    Welch's collects and protects children's personal

                  <p>If a registrant selects the "under 13" age range 
                    in that field, we will not use any information provided by 
                    that child unless and until we obtain parental consent to 
                    do so. We will request that the child provide us with their 
                    parent's or legal guardian's e-mail address, mailing 
                    address and phone number so we can request consent to retain 
                    the child's information. Until parental consent is received, 
                    for a child under 13, we will not use this information in 
                    any way. If Welch's does not receive verifiable parental 
                    consent within seven days of the child's attempt to register 
                    with welchs.com, we will permanently delete the child's 
                    personal information.</p>
                  <p>Welch's will not ask a child under age 13 to provide 
                    financially sensitive information such as credit card numbers.</p>
                  <p>2. <u>How We May Use Information We Collect From Children 
                    Under Age 13: </u><br>
                  </p>
                  <p>We will use the information collected on the Welch's 
                    website to (a) allow registered users under 13 access to a 
                    members-only section within www.welchs.com, called "My 
                    Grapelink" and (b) communicate with our under 13 registered 
                    visitors via permission-based email messages, to provide updates 
                    about our products and promotions.</p>
                  <p>Unless the parent chooses to register as well with welchs.com, 
                    we will not use the parent's or guardian's e-mail 
                    address or mailing address for any purpose other than to communicate 
                    with the parent or guardian in order to obtain permission 
                    for their child to register and participate on the Welch's 
                    website. After the parent has provided consent for us to retain 
                    their child's information, we will keep the parent's 
                    information provided by the child on file to show that we 
                    have complied with our privacy protection policy, to send 
                    future requests for consent if necessary, and to ensure that 
                    only the child's parent can review the child's personal 
                    information. The parent will have an option to create their 
                    own registration record with us when they access their child's 
                    record to review, approve or delete it.</p>
                  <p>3. <u>Permission Process - How A Parent May Give Consent 
                    to Collection of Information from a Child under Age 13:</u></p>
                  <p>As outlined above, all children under the age of 13 will 
                    be required to provide us with the name, mailing address, 
                    e-mail address, and phone number of their parent or legal 
                    guardian in order to seek to become officially registered 
                    on the Welch's website. Once the child has provided this 
                    information, we will send an e-mail to the parent explaining 
                    that the child is attempting to register on the site and explaining 
                    how the parent can provide consent or deny consent for the 
                    child's registration. This e-mail to the parent will 
                    provide the parent with a specific link, to access the child's 
                    information. Once the parent accesses the child's record, 
                    the parent will have the option to:</p>
                  <p> 
                  </p><ul>
                    <li>Provide consent to retaining and using the child's 
                      information </li>
                    <li>Edit the child's information and provide consent 
                      to retaining and using it</li>
                    <li>Deny consent and delete the child's information</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>If a parent or guardian provides consent to collection and 
                    use of the child's information, an e-mail is sent to 
                    the parent, with a copy to the child, to confirm that Welch's 
                    has received parental consent and that the child now may participate 
                    as an officially registered member of the site. The child's 
                    registration to the Welch's website will be activated 
                    once the parent visits the website provides consent for Welch's 
                    to retain and use the child's information as outlined 
                    above.</p>
                  <p>In the event that the parent or guardian of the child who 
                    wishes to register to create a My Grapelink account does not 
                    have an e-mail account and does not have access to the Internet 
                    to create an e-mail account, an alternative means of parental 
                    consent will be provided. The child who is registering has 
                    the option of clicking on a link, located next to the e-mail 
                    field on the Parent/Guardian Consent Request page of My Grapelink. 
                    Once clicked upon, this link will provide instruction to the 
                    child to enter the following e-mail address into the e-mail 
                    field of the Parent/Guardian Consent Request page: customerservice@welchs.com. 
                    After this e-mail is entered, the child will complete the 
                    remainder of the page with their parent or guardian's 
                    name, address and phone number. After the child submits the 
                    information by clicking on the submit button at the bottom 
                    of the page, their record will be forwarded to customerservice@welchs.com, 
                    an internal Welch's e-mail account, established to receive 
                    such requests. Upon receipt, the e-mail will be printed out 
                    and mailed to the parent of the child who wishes to register. 
                    The e-mail printout, and two copies of the printout of the 
                    child's information that the child provided to Welch's, 
                    will accompany a letter to the parent. This letter will provide 
                    the same information as the e-mail letter that is sent to 
                    the parent upon the child's attempt to register. Welch's 
                    will require the parent to return one copy of the form containing 
                    their child's information with their signature, indicating 
                    their consent for Welch's to retain their child's 
                    online information. The parent may also edit the record and 
                    return one copy of the child's record, with their signature, 
                    to Welch's. The parent may also request that the record 
                    be deleted by indicating their wishes in writing on one copy 
                    of the child's record. If, within 21 days of the date 
                    that the child enters their information into Welch's 
                    Grapelink, a return letter is not received from the parent 
                    with instructions to approve (provide consent), edit (and 
                    provide consent) or delete the record of the child, the record 
                    will be automatically deleted by welchs.com. Parents who elect 
                    to return the letter of request for their consent for Welch's 
                    to retain their child's information must be addressed 
                    to: <br>

                  <p>Once Welch's has received consent from the parent of 
                    the child attempting to register, a letter confirming that

                  </p>
                  <p>The parent or guardian of a registered child, will always 
                    have the option at any time to view, change, or delete any 
                    of the information we have collected from their child. For 
                    security reasons, we will not give out any of the information 
                    that we have on file to enable access to a child's record. 
                    If a parent does not have the e-mail message that was sent 
                    to the parent containing the hypertext link (URL) to the child's 
                    personal information (the e-mail with a subject line "Request 
                    for Consent to Collect Child's Personal Information"), 
                    the parent may send an e-mail to: support@welchs.com and provide 
                    us with the child's name and the parent's e-mail 
                    address. The parent's e-mail address must match the parental 
                    e-mail address that the child provided to Welch's and 
                    to which Welch's e-mailed the request for parental consent. 
                    If the e-mail address you provide us in your request matches 
                    that provided by the child and from which we received parental 
                    consent, Welch's will then resend the original "Request 
                    for Consent to Collect Child's Personal Information" 
                    to the same e-mail address to which we originally sent it.</p>
                  <p>A parent or guardian of a child who does not have an e-mail 
                    account and has given their written consent to Welch's 
                    to retain the information provided by and collected about 
                    their child (as outlined in the section above: Permission 
                    Process – How a Parent May Give Consent to Collection

                    by sending a written request at the address below, with explicit 
                    directions to edit or to delete their child's record.
