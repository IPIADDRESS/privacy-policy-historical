  <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better   protect your privacy we provide this policy to explain our information practices   and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and   used on the www.welchs.com website. To make this Policy easy to find, we make it   available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable   information may be requested.</p>
<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Welch's will not collect any personally-identifiable information about you   through our website unless you provide it to us voluntarily. This policy applies   to all information collected or submitted on the Welch's website. On some pages,   you can make requests, register to receive materials or enter promotions. The   types of personal information collected include: name, address, e-mail address,   phone number, gender, permission to contact the person completing the   registration, number of children in the household, if the registrant is a   Welch's consumer or not, and general questions relating to product preferences   or areas of interest on our website. We also collect the age of anyone who   attempts to register this personally identifiable information on our site. We do   this in order to fully comply with the rules and regulations under the   Children's Online Privacy Protection Act to obtain parental consent for our   visitors under the age of 13.</p>
<h2>The Way We Use Information</h2>
<p>In order to participate in any promotional activities (such as a sweepstakes)   or request a coupon from Welch's or partake in certain other activities offered   only within a members-only section within www.welchs.com, called "My Grapelink",   a complete and approved registration record is required. Any area outside of the   "My Grapelink" area of welchs.com is open to all visitors of the website.</p>
<p>We will use the information collected on the Welch's website to (a) allow   registered users to access the "My Grapelink" section; (b) communicate with   those registered users who have authorized Welch's to contact them to provide   updates about our products and promotions; (c) develop new marketing and product   ideas; and (d) notify sweepstakes winners of what they have won.</p>
<p>Information provided by registration or through a survey may be used   internally by us to improve the design of our website, to increase our   understanding of our consumers and their product preferences, and for other   marketing and promotional purposes. For example, we may study responses relating   to the perceptions or flavor preferences of our products by consumers. These   learnings may then be used to shape future marketing decisions by us.</p>
<p>Welch's also collects aggregate, non-personally-identifiable information on   users by recording the IP address from the computers of visitors to welchs.com.   An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you surf the   Web. Web servers, or the computers that provide the web pages to your computer   for you to view, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When   you use your computer to request to view a page from a server, your IP address   is logged by that server. Welch's does not link IP addresses to anything   personally identifiable. Your visit to welchs.com will be logged; however, you   will remain anonymous to us. We track the number of people that view each page   of our website to better understand which features are most popular and best   meet the needs of our visitors.</p>
<p>Welch's will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to   anyone. Welch's will send personally identifiable information about you to other   companies or people when:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have your consent to do so. </li>
<li>We need to share the information in order to provide the product or service   you have requested. </li>
<li>We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Welch's   to provide a product or service for you on our behalf. Examples include hosting   and helping to run this Web site, delivering packages, sending postal mail and   e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data,   providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service. Unless we tell   you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally   identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist   us, unless they have your consent to do so. </li>
<li>We need to respond to valid legal process. This includes a search warrant,   subpoena, or court order, and any other instance when we believe we are required   to do so by law. We may also make disclosures to protect your safety during   emergencies if your physical safety is believed to be at risk, to protect the   security or integrity of the Welch's Web site, or to take precautions against   liability. We will take reasonable steps to limit the scope of these   disclosures. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about   you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to   share the information (opt-out).</p>
<p>Welch's may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information about   our users with other companies for marketing and promotional purposes.</p>
<p>If you do not register with welchs.com, but only provide us with your e-mail   address in connection with contacting Welch's by e-mail, we will use your e-mail   addresses to answer your e-mail. If you authorize Welch's to contact you, we may   use your e-mail address to send you notice of values and promotions, such as   coupon offerings and sweepstakes.</p>
<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
<p>Welch's website uses cookies to customize the visits of consumers to the "My   Grapelink" section within the welchs.com website. Cookies are messages given to   a Web browser (a software program that resides on your computer and allows you   to surf the Web) by a Web server when the Web browser requests to "see" pages on   a Web site. The browser stores the message from the server and sends it back to   the server each time the browser requests to see a page from that server.</p>
<p>The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at most   websites. Most browsers are set to accept cookies. You always have the option to   set the browser on your computer to refuse cookies. The main purpose of cookies   is to identify users and prepare customized web pages for them to view. For   example, you may receive a welcome message that includes your name instead of a   generic welcome message. A cookie will also retrieve the information that was   voluntarily provided by you to help improve your user experience or speed up   your navigation on a website. You will need to enable the use of cookies to   register on and navigate through the "My Grapelink" pages of welchs.com. You   will not need to enable cookies to use any other part of welchs.com that does   not require a personal registration record.</p>
<h2>Our Commitment To Data Security</h2>
<p>In an endeavor to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and   ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical   and electronic procedures to safeguard and secure personal information we   collect. We cannot guarantee the security of any information that you disclose   online, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>Welch's incorporates security measures to protect our data from unauthorized   use. Firewalls are utilized to protect our servers and network from unauthorized   users accessing and tampering with files and other information that we   store.</p>
<p>Although we take the utmost care to protect your information, we cannot   ensure the security of any information that you disclose online and transmit to   us.</p>
<h2>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</h2>
<p>After registering with welchs.com, you will always have the option of editing   the information you provided in your registration. To do this, visit the "My   Grapelink" section of welchs.com, log in using your e-mail and password, and   click on the "My Account" link on the "My Grapelink" page.

<h2><a name="child"></a><span>OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</span></h2>
<p>Welch's is committed to doing its part to protect the privacy of young   children. Accordingly, and consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy   Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), Welch's will never knowingly collect personally   identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without first obtaining   verifiable consent from the child's parent or legal guardian.</p>
<p>The following sections of our Privacy Policy explain how Welch's collects and   protects children's personal information, by describing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The personal information we collect from children under the age of 13 when   they register on Welch's website and why we collect this information; </li>
<li>How we may use the information we collect from children under the age of 13; </li>
<li>How a parent may give us permission to obtain registration information from   a child who is under the age of 13; </li>
<li>How a parent may edit or delete the information submitted to us from a child   who is under the age of 13; </li>
<li>Who we may share this information with; </li>
<li>Whether or not the information we request is necessary to register or   participate in an activity on the Welch's website. </li>
</ul>
<h2>1. <span>The Information We Collect from Children Under 13:</span></h2>
<p>Welch's collects personal information from children under 13 so that they may   participate as registered members of welchs.com and have access to the "My   Grapelink" section of the Welch's website. "My Grapelink" allows registered   users to participate in promotional activities such as contests and sweepstakes   or request a coupon from Welch's.</p>
<p>We request the following information in order to register on Welch's   website:</p>
<ul>
<li>E-mail address </li>
<li>Password (selected by the child) </li>
<li>Actual Name </li>
<li>Address, including city, state and zip code </li>
<li>Phone Number </li>
<li>Gender </li>
<li>Age (by range, not by specific date of birth) </li>
<li>Permission to contact the person completing the registration to provide   future announcements of values and promotions. (A grant of such permission to   contact is not a prerequisite to participation in the "My Grapelink" section.) </li>
<li>Number of children in the household (optional) </li>
<li>If the registrant is a Welch's consumer or not (optional) </li>
<li>General questions relating to product preferences or areas of interest on   our website (optional) </li>
</ul>
<p>If a registrant selects the "under 13" age range in that field, we will not   use any information provided by that child unless and until we obtain parental   consent to do so. We will request that the child provide us with their parent's   or legal guardian's e-mail address, mailing address and phone number so we can   request consent to retain the child's information. Until parental consent is   received, for a child under 13, we will not use this information in any way. If   Welch's does not receive verifiable parental consent within seven days of the   child's attempt to register with welchs.com, we will permanently delete the   child's personal information.</p>
<p>Welch's will not ask a child under age 13 to provide financially sensitive   information such as credit card numbers.</p>
<h2>2. <span>How We May Use Information We Collect From Children Under Age 13: </span></h2>
<p>We will use the information collected on the Welch's website to (a) allow   registered users under 13 access to a members-only section within   www.welchs.com, called "My Grapelink" and (b) communicate with our under 13   registered visitors via permission-based email messages, to provide updates   about our products and promotions.</p>
<p>Unless the parent chooses to register as well with welchs.com, we will not   use the parent's or guardian's e-mail address or mailing address for any purpose   other than to communicate with the parent or guardian in order to obtain   permission for their child to register and participate on the Welch's website.   After the parent has provided consent for us to retain their child's   information, we will keep the parent's information provided by the child on file   to show that we have complied with our privacy protection policy, to send future   requests for consent if necessary, and to ensure that only the child's parent   can review the child's personal information. The parent will have an option to   create their own registration record with us when they access their child's   record to review, approve or delete it.</p>
<h2>3. <span>Permission Process - How A Parent May Give Consent to Collection of   Information from a Child under Age 13:</span></h2>
<p>As outlined above, all children under the age of 13 will be required to   provide us with the name, mailing address, e-mail address, and phone number of   their parent or legal guardian in order to seek to become officially registered   on the Welch's website. Once the child has provided this information, we will   send an e-mail to the parent explaining that the child is attempting to register   on the site and explaining how the parent can provide consent or deny consent   for the child's registration. This e-mail to the parent will provide the parent   with a specific link, to access the child's information. Once the parent   accesses the child's record, the parent will have the option to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide consent to retaining and using the child's information </li>
<li>Edit the child's information and provide consent to retaining and using it </li>
<li>Deny consent and delete the child's information </li>
</ul>
<p>If a parent or guardian provides consent to collection and use of the child's   information, an e-mail is sent to the parent, with a copy to the child, to   confirm that Welch's has received parental consent and that the child now may   participate as an officially registered member of the site. The child's   registration to the Welch's website will be activated once the parent visits the   website provides consent for Welch's to retain and use the child's information   as outlined above.</p>
<p>In the event that the parent or guardian of the child who wishes to register   to create a My Grapelink account does not have an e-mail account and does not   have access to the Internet to create an e-mail account, an alternative means of   parental consent will be provided. The child who is registering has the option   of clicking on a link, located next to the e-mail field on the Parent/Guardian   Consent Request page of My Grapelink. Once clicked upon, this link will provide   instruction to the child to enter the following e-mail address into the e-mail   field of the Parent/Guardian Consent Request page: customerservice@welchs.com.   After this e-mail is entered, the child will complete the remainder of the page   with their parent or guardian's name, address and phone number. After the child   submits the information by clicking on the submit button at the bottom of the   page, their record will be forwarded to customerservice@welchs.com, an internal   Welch's e-mail account, established to receive such requests. Upon receipt, the   e-mail will be printed out and mailed to the parent of the child who wishes to   register. The e-mail printout, and two copies of the printout of the child's   information that the child provided to Welch's, will accompany a letter to the   parent. This letter will provide the same information as the e-mail letter that   is sent to the parent upon the child's attempt to register. Welch's will require   the parent to return one copy of the form containing their child's information   with their signature, indicating their consent for Welch's to retain their   child's online information. The parent may also edit the record and return one   copy of the child's record, with their signature, to Welch's. The parent may   also request that the record be deleted by indicating their wishes in writing on   one copy of the child's record. If, within 21 days of the date that the child   enters their information into Welch's Grapelink, a return letter is not received   from the parent with instructions to approve (provide consent), edit (and   provide consent) or delete the record of the child, the record will be   automatically deleted by welchs.com. Parents who elect to return the letter of   request for their consent for Welch's to retain their child's information must   be addressed to: <br> <br> Welch's Consumer Affairs<br> 2 South Portage   Street<br> Westfield, NY 14787-1492<br> Attn: www.welchs.com</p>
<p>Once Welch's has received consent from the parent of the child attempting to   register, a letter confirming that consent to registration will be mailed to the   parent, with a copy to the child.</p>
<h2>4.<span> How A Parent May Edit or Delete Their Child's Information or Revoke   Consent:</span></h2>
<p>The parent or guardian of a registered child, will always have the option at   any time to view, change, or delete any of the information we have collected   from their child. For security reasons, we will not give out any of the   information that we have on file to enable access to a child's record. If a   parent does not have the e-mail message that was sent to the parent containing   the hypertext link (URL) to the child's personal information (the e-mail with a   subject line "Request for Consent to Collect Child's Personal Information"), the   parent may send an e-mail to: support@welchs.com and provide us with the child's   name and the parent's e-mail address. The parent's e-mail address must match the   parental e-mail address that the child provided to Welch's and to which Welch's   e-mailed the request for parental consent. If the e-mail address you provide us   in your request matches that provided by the child and from which we received   parental consent, Welch's will then resend the original "Request for Consent to   Collect Child's Personal Information" to the same e-mail address to which we   originally sent it.</p>
<p>A parent or guardian of a child who does not have an e-mail account and has   given their written consent to Welch's to retain the information provided by and   collected about their child (as outlined in the section above: Permission   Process – How a Parent May Give Consent to Collection of Information from a   Child under Age 13) may wish to edit or delete this record in the future. The   parent may do this by sending a written request at the address below, with   explicit directions to edit or to delete their child's record. Welch's will mail   to the parent a written confirmation of this edit or deletion, with a copy to   the child.</p>
<p>5. <span>Who We May Share this Information With:</span></p>
<p>Welch's has set forth the same guidelines regarding the way we use personal   information to apply to the personally identifiable information of children   under 13 who register with our site, as with registrants who are over the age of   13 and do not require parental consent to register with welchs.com:</p>
<p>Welch's will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to   anyone. Welch's will send personally identifiable information about you to other   companies or people when:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have your consent to do so. </li>
<li>We need to share the information in order to provide the product or service   you have requested. </li>
<li>We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Welch's   to provide a product or service for you on our behalf. Examples include hosting   and helping to run this Web site, delivering packages, sending postal mail and   e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data,   providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service. Unless we tell   you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally   identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist   us, unless they have your consent to do so. </li>
<li>We need to respond to valid legal process. This includes a search warrant,   subpoena, or court order, and any other instance when we believe we are required   to do so by law. We may also make disclosures to protect your safety during   emergencies if your physical safety is believed to be at risk, to protect the   security or integrity of the Welch's Web site, or to take precautions against   liability. We will take reasonable steps to limit the scope of these   disclosures. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about   you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to   share the information (opt-out).</p>
<p>Welch's may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information about   our users with other companies for marketing and promotional purposes.</p>
<p>6. <span>Whether or Not the Information We Request is Necessary to Register or   Participate in an Activity on the Welch's Website:</span></p>
<p>Welch's cannot and will not condition a child's participation in an activity   on this site on the child disclosing more personal information than is   reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. Personal information   sufficient to create a complete and approved registration record is required in   order to participate in any promotional activities (such as sweepstakes) or,   request a coupon from Welch's through the "My Grapelink" members-only section of   welchs.com. All areas outside of the "My Grapelink" area of welchs.com are open   to all visitors to the website.</p>
<h2>Changes in Our Policy</h2>
<p>Welch's reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at our discretion.   If we decide to change our Privacy Policy we will post those changes here.
