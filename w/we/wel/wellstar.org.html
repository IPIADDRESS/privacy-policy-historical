          <p align="justify">1. Personal Information WellStar Collects. WellStar's web server recognizes 
            the IP address of your domain name, but does not associate your IP 
            address to your personal information. An IP address is a number automatically 
            assigned to your computer each time you access the Internet. All computer 
            identification and communication on the Internet is conducted using 
            IP addresses. WellStar collects IP addresses in order to facilitate 
            system administration, report aggregate information to licensors, 
            sponsors, advertisers, and suppliers, and to conduct Site analysis. 
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, WellStar may associate your IP address 
            with your e-mail address to identify you if you refuse to comply with 
            WellStar's Web Site User Agreement, and to identify you if you threaten 
            this Site, its users or others. IF YOU SEND WELLSTAR E-MAIL, SUBSCRIBE 
            TO A NEWSLETTER, OR ORDER PRODUCTS FROM THIS SITE, WELLSTAR WILL HAVE 
            YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS AT THIS SITE. WellStar uses "cookies" to personalize

            by all users. A cookie is a text file that this Site transfers to

            assigns a random, unique number to your computer. We do NOT use this 
            cookie to collect or store personally identifiable information about 
            you. The Site uses cookies during your interactive on-line session 
            to deliver content specific to your interests and to avoid repeatedly 
            showing you the same advertisement or other message. WellStar's log 
            files only contain data reporting the areas of the Site that you visit 
            along with the cookie information. WellStar's sponsors, licensors, 
            suppliers or advertisers may also use cookies when you select their

            using cookies is solely for internal use and will not be sold, rented,

            TO AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY THIRD PARTY'S USE OF COOKIES AND THE MANAGEMENT 
            OF THE INFORMATION THEY GATHER. WellStar does not intend to collect 
            any information from children or minors. In the event WellStar learns 
            that it has inadvertently collected information from a child or minor 
            under the age of eighteen (18), any and all such information will 
            be promptly deleted from WellStar's systems. You may request delivery 
            of services, communications or products to your e-mail address or, 
            in some cases, to a valid U.S. postal address.</p>
          <p align="justify">2. How WellStar Uses Your Personal Information. WellStar only uses 
            your personal information to provide you with the services, communications, 
            or products that you have requested or as otherwise described in this 
            Policy. In the event you request a service, communication, or product 
            either from WellStar or a third party at the Site, and such service, 
            communication, or product requires the disclosure of personal information 
            to complete the transaction, WellStar will tell you beforehand and 
            provide you an opportunity to affirmatively opt in, prior to transferring 
            the personal information and proceeding with the delivery of your 
            requested service, communication, or product. With respect to e-commerce 
            or e-healthcare transactions, WellStar may store your personal information 
            to verify the transaction for customer service and accounting reasons 
            and may use this information to personalize your future experiences 
            at this Site. WellStar will not use your personal information to contact 
            you for any other purpose, unless necessary for the enforcement of 
            this Policy or the Web Site User Agreement. In addition, WellStar 
            may also share certain unidentifiable portions of your personal information, 
            in aggregate form, with other third parties. If you purchase an item 
            through WellStar's Health and Fitness Store and/or Gift Shop Bank 
            of America requests information from you on the order form, including 
            but not limited to, your name, shipping address, credit card number 
            and expiration date. This information is used for billing purposes 
            and to fill your order. If Bank of America encounters a problem while 
            filling your order, this contact information will be used to notify 
            you.</p>   
	

          <p align="justify">3. Personal Information WellStar Discloses. Except as otherwise provided 
            herein, WellStar will not disclose any personal information it gathers 
            about you that could be used to identify or contact you. Any of your 
            personal information that WellStar does provide to third parties will 
            be treated in accordance with the terms of this Policy and subject 
            to a Chain-of-Trust agreement entered into by and between WellStar 
            and any such third party. In addition, in the following limited circumstances, 
            WellStar may release your personal information to third parties: 1) 
            to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, 
            subpoena or court order; or 2) in special cases such as a threat of 
            physical violence to you or others. WellStar may also provide your 
            personal information to third parties, such as licensors, sponsors, 
            advertisers, and suppliers at this Site, where it is necessary for 
            them to provide WellStar with products and services related to better 
            operation and maintenance of this Site. By entering into a Chain-of-Trust 
            agreement with such third parties, WellStar attempts to prevent further 
            dissemination and disclosure of your personal information. Notwithstanding 
            the foregoing, from time to time, WellStar may provide to third parties 
            information about you which does not allow you to be identified or 
            contacted. If you obtain dial-up access to this Site from an independent 
            Internet service provider ("ISP"), the ISP may have information relating 
            to you, which can be connected with information you provide at this 
            Site. Please check the privacy policy of your ISP, or any other company 
            that provides content, service or products to you, as to how it uses 
            your information.</p> 


<p align="justify">4.	Your Privacy Choices.  You may request WellStar to remove your personal information from its secure databases and servers at any time by contacting WellStar at the addresses provided hereunder in Updates, Changes and Contacting WellStar.  In addition, upon reasonable notice, you may request to see any personal information WellStar may have stored about you and make any corrections, as necessary.

If you request e-mails or subscribe to a newsletter, you may UNSUBSCRIBE at any time by notifying WellStar at the addresses provided hereunder in Updates, Changes and Contacting WellStar.</p> 

 
<p align="justify">5.	WellStar's Security Practices and Procedures. WellStar wants your personal information to remain as secure as reasonably possible. Hence, we have taken several measures to protect your information from loss, misuse or alteration, by using a combination of administrative procedures, physical, and technical safeguards.  

With respect to technical safeguards, WellStar uses a Secure Socket Layer protocol connection ("SSL"), to help ensure the integrity and privacy of the personal information you provide to WellStar via the Internet.  All transactions involving sensitive information such as your credit/debit card number are conducted using a SSL connection.  This connection provides increased security of your information as it is transmitted to our website.  WellStar stores your personal information on a separate server where your user password is encrypted and stored in a database.  This server and database are located in a physically secured area.  In addition, access to personal information is controlled by authentication.  

On the administrative side, only authorized WellStar employees are permitted access to your personal information, strictly on a "need to know basis."  In addition, all WellStar employees must abide by and sign a copy of WellStar's privacy and confidentiality policies.  When WellStar deals with third parties, WellStar and the third party must enter into a Chain-of-Trust agreement and only authorized employees of the third party are permitted access to your personal information on a "need to know basis."  Any WellStar or third party employee who violates such policies is subject to disciplinary action, which may result in termination.</p>  


<p>6.	Updates, Changes, and Contacting WellStar.</p>
