<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>Welcome to <strong>www.wellnessfx.com</strong> (the <strong>"Site"</strong>), a website operated by
WellnessFX, Inc. (<strong>"WellnessFX"</strong>, <strong>"we"</strong>, <strong>"us"</strong>, or <strong>"our"</strong>). We operate an
online wellness service enabling members (<strong>"Members"</strong>) to purchase
laboratory diagnostics, report their health history and engage
healthcare providers (<strong>"Authorized Providers"</strong>) to obtain advice regarding
the results of such diagnostics and other wellness-oriented healthcare
advice (the <strong>"Service"</strong>). Our Site provides further information about our
Service. We know you are concerned about your privacy, so we developed
this privacy policy (<strong>"Privacy Policy"</strong>) to explain how we collect, use,
and disclose information from and/or about you when you use the Site or
the Services, whether you are a Member, Authorized Provider or simply
visiting our Site (<strong>"Visitor"</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Certain Definitions.</strong> So we are clear about the terms we are using, when

information about you that is personally identifiable to you, such as
your contact information (e.g., name, address, email address, or
telephone number), and any other non-public information that is
associated with such information (collectively, <strong>"Personal Information"</strong>).
Also, when we use the term <strong>"De-Identified Information"</strong>, we mean
information that is neither used nor intended to be used to personally
identify an individual. Lastly, when we use the term <strong>"Cookies"</strong>, we mean
the small pieces of information that a website sends to your browser
while you are viewing a website.</p>

<p><strong>No Information from Children under age 18.</strong> The Site is not directed to
children and children are not eligible to use our Service. If you are

personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have
collected personal information from a child under age 18, we will delete
that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might
have any information from a child under age 18, please contact us at
support@wellnessfx.com.</p>

<p><strong>Questions.</strong> If you have questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy,
please contact us by sending an email to support@wellnessfx.com.</p>

<p><u><strong>NOTE TO BETA USERS: If you are a beta user of the Service the beta
agreement between you and WellnessFX has additional provisions regarding
your personal information. In the event of a conflict between a
provision in the beta agreement and this privacy policy, the provision
in the beta agreement will prevail.</strong></u></p>
