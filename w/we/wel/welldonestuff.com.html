<p><span>In conjunction with the Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which any personal information you provide will be collected, processed, used and stored by us. Please read it carefully. By visiting this Website, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Policy, which may be amended in our sole discretion from time to time. If you use the Website after we have published such changes, you will be agreeing to be bound by those changes. </span><strong>If you do not agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy at any time, you should not use the Website.</strong></p>

<p><strong>B. Introduction</strong></p>
<p><span>This Privacy Policy explains the following: </span></p>
<ol>
<li>What information we collect about you and why;</li>
<li>How we use information about you;</li>
<li>How your information may be shared;</li>
<li>How we store and process information about you;</li>
<li>When and how we communicate with you;</li>
<li>How long we may keep personal information about you;</li>

<li><span>How to contact us;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1. What information we collect about you and why:</strong></p>
<p><span>We may collect two types of information: personally identifiable information (“PII”) and information that is not personally identifiable (“Non PII”).</span></p>
<p><strong>A.&nbsp;What PII Do We Collect?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>When you register with us, we ask for information such as your name, postal address, zip code, email address, and telephone number. We also acquire your Internet protocol address and/or mobile device identification, which certain jurisdictions consider to be PII because it could be used to identify an individual or device if it were combined with other identifying information. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>We may capture user information when users send us questions or comments via e-mail. Information collected in this manner will only be used to contact the user and/or respond to the user’s inquiry/issue. Sending us an e-mail will not enroll you on our e-mail list unless you specifically request it. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>For purchases made on the Website, a third-party payment processor, such as PayPal, may collect your name, email address, postal address, contact details and credit or debit card information. This record will be stored and processed in the United States and other countries (see further below under “How we use information about you” and “How we store and process information about you”). </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>We take reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of your personally identifiable information by using industry recognized security safeguards such as site monitoring, secured networks and servers, firewalls and/or encryption. When we ask for sensitive information, we protect it through the use of encryption during transmission, such as SSL (Secure Socket Layer). Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the Internet is completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information within industry standards, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </span></p>

<p><strong>B.&nbsp;What Non PII Do We Collect?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>We may capture Non PII such as your user agent, referring URL, browser operating system, device type, location, and/or the language option you chose in your device. Some of the information that we acquire cannot identify, distinguish or trace you or your device. Alternatively, some information could be considered PII when combined with other identifying information. However, the information is not used by us in a way that identifies, distinguishes or traces you or your device, but is instead used in an anonymous way, often aggregated with other anonymous information about other users. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>If your PII changes, or if you no longer choose to use our services or the Website, you can contact customer service by e-mail, telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below to assist you with changes to your account. To the extent your account closes or becomes inactive, we will continue to protect your information as described in this Privacy Policy. </span></p>

<li>
<p><span>We may make available services such as blogs, message boards and chat functionality to which you are able to post information and materials. Please note that any information you disclose through such services or otherwise on the Website becomes public information, and may be available to visitors to the Website and to the general public. In addition, when you choose to make a posting on such services certain personal information will be available for other users to view.

<p><strong>4.&nbsp;How we store and process information about you:</strong></p>
<p><span>In order to communicate with you about products, local events, offers and opportunities, the information that we collect from you may be transferred to, stored, used and processed by Well Done Stuff in the United States or one of our service providers based in the United States or outside of the United States. Such entities may be engaged in, among other things: (i) preparing and sending newsletters to which you subscribe; (ii) the processing of payment details; and (iii) the provision of support services. </span></p>
<p><span>If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing information collection and use that may differ from United States law, please note that you are transferring your personal information to the United States. The laws of some countries may not provide the same levels of protection of personal information as your home country, particularly if you are a resident in the European Union. By submitting your information, you agree to the collection, transfer, storage, use and processing of information about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. When you provide your personal information to us or our service providers or vendors, you consent to the processing of your </span><span>information in the United States as the Website is operated in the United States. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that information about you is treated securely in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and that all information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or those of our service providers. </span></p>
<p><span>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES TREAT YOUR INFORMATION IN A MANNER THAT MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM, AND LESS PROTECTIVE THAN, THE TREATMENT REQUIRED UNDER THE LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND JURISDICTIONS. IF YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, YOU SHOULD NOT SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH US, OR MAKE USE OF THIS WEBSITE. </span></p>
<p><span>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED, YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO REQUIRE US TO TREAT YOUR IDENTIFYING INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF ANY COUNTRY OR JURISIDICTION OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, THE FOREGOING WAIVER MAY NOT BE LEGALLY BINDING IN SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. TO THE EXTENT IT IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING IN THE COUNTRY IN WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED, THIS FOREGOING WAIVER DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU. </span></p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;When and how we communicate with you:</strong></p>
<p><span>We may use the information we collect to contact you by mail, email and telephone (including automated calls, and by SMS text messages and other multimedia electronic messages such as picture messaging). </span></p>
<p><span>We will not send you unsolicited premium rate SMS messages (which are SMS messages you pay to receive), although your service provider may impose a charge on any messages that you receive. Please check with your service provider for details. </span></p>
<p><span>You can unsubscribe from promotional emails and other commercial communications by following the instructions contained within the communication. Please note that due to marketing production schedules you may receive any messages already in production. </span></p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;How long we will hold personal information about you</strong></p>
<p><span>We will hold personal information about you on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant service, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with Well Done Stuff, subject to any applicable laws and/or regulations. In the case that you wish to cancel your registration as a member of the Website once an account is deleted, we cannot use the personal information about you other than for administrative purposes. </span></p>
<p><span>Where you contribute to the Website, we will generally only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted.</span></p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;How you can opt-out from receiving communications from us:</strong></p>
<p><span>At any time you can add or remove your name from an Well Done Stuff list by contacting us at <a class="underline" href="mailto:contact@interestingengineering.com" rel="nofollow">contact@interestingengineering.com</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>We will endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please keep in mind that if you opt-out of receiving promotional messages from this Website, we will continue to send you </span><span>transactional messages and important account-related information regarding this Website or products or services offered through this Website.</span></p>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp;Analysis Tools and our use of cookies</strong></p>
<p><span>We may use cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or similar devices to identify you, to keep track of the user’s interactions with the Website, and to and enhance certain activities available on the Website. These devices are small text or other electronic files that are used for user-identification purposes, record- keeping purposes, and to increase the ease of use of the Website. We may use persistent or not-persistent cookies. Users can remove or reject persistent cookies by following the directions provided in their Internet browser’s “help” file. If a user removes a persistent cookie or rejects persistent cookies, the functionality of the Website, or any part thereof, may be impaired or unavailable. </span></p>
<p><span>Third-party advertisers on the Website may use cookies and other technologies in their advertisements for statistical purposes; we have no control over cookies placed on the Website by third parties. </span></p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp;Information over the Internet and other Websites</strong></p>
<p><span>The Internet is a global network and, therefore, there are times when information about you travels globally and may not always be completely secure. If you provide us with information over the Internet, this will be at your own risk. By using the Website, you agree and authorize us to process information in this way. However, please be assured that we use commercially reasonable procedures and security features to prevent unauthorized access to information about you. </span></p>
<p><span>In an attempt to provide you with increased value, the Website may contain links to third party websites. These linked websites have separate and independent privacy policies or may have no privacy policy at all. We are not responsible or liable for the content, activities or privacy policies of such linked websites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of the Website, and welcome any feedback about a linked website (including if a specific link does not work). </span></p>
<p><strong>10.&nbsp;Offensive or inappropriate content</strong></p>
<p><span>If you find any link on our Website that is offensive for any reason, you are free to contact and inform us any moment. We will consider requests to remove links but we are not obligated to or so or to respond to you directly. </span><span>You acknowledge that we have not reviewed and do not necessarily endorse the content of these websites, applications, destinations or services linked to or accessible from this Website and are not responsible for the content or actions of any other sites, applications, destinations or services. Your linking to or accessing any other website, application, destination or service is at your sole risk. </span></p>
<p><strong>11.&nbsp;Legal disclaimer</strong></p>
<p><span>We are not responsible nor will be liable to you in any way for events beyond our direct control. Because of the complex and constantly changing nature of our technology and business, we cannot guarantee nor do we represent that our performance will be error free, and to the maximum extent permitted by law we will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages or other loss suffered by you and relating to the use or release of your personal information. </span></p>
<p><span>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS </span></p>
<p><span>A California privacy law that went into effect on January 1, 2005, the “Shine the Light” law, allows California residents to obtain a list of third parties to whom a business has disclosed personal information if it shares such information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, if a business adopts and discloses in its privacy policy a policy of not disclosing customers’ personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and by providing a cost-free means to exercise that right. </span></p>
<p><span>As stated earlier in this Privacy Policy, personal information submitted at the time of registration or submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes only with the user’s permission. Whenever a user agrees to allow us to collect personal information, we provide the user with an option to prevent such information from being shared for marketing and promotional purposes with third parties. Furthermore, you may exercise this cost-free option at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:contact@interestingengineering.com" rel="nofollow">contact@interestingengineering.com</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>Because the Website has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with details on how you may opt-in or opt-out of the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes, we are not required to provide you with the third party list. </span></p>
<p><strong>12. How to contact us</strong></p>
<p><span>We welcome your questions, comments and concerns about privacy. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@interestingengineering.com" rel="nofollow">legal@interestingengineering.com</a> with any questions or comments you may have regarding the privacy of your information.</span></p>
