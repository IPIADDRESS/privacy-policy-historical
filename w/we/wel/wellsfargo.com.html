    At Wells Fargo and Norwest, we know how important 
    personal privacy is to you. Because of our 
    interest in protecting your privacy, our combined 
    banks and companies – now affiliates of the 
    new Wells Fargo &amp; Company – have adopted 
    the following privacy principles, continuing our 
    commitment to you, our valued customer:<br><br>

      <ol>
      <li><b>Recognition of Your Expectation of 
      Privacy.</b> We recognize that you expect privacy 
      and security for your personal and financial 
      affairs. We understand the need to safeguard our 
      sensitive information about you that you have 
      entrusted to us within our affiliated family of 
      banks and companies. We maintain standards and 
      procedures designed to prevent misuse of this 
      information.<br><br>

      </li><li><b>Our Collection, Retention, and Use of 
      Information about You.</b> We collect, retain, 
      and use information about you only where we 
      reasonably believe that it will help administer 
      our business or provide products, services, and 
      other opportunities to you. We collect and 
      retain information about you only for specific 
      business purposes – and we will tell you 
      why we are collecting and retaining it upon 
      your request. We use information to protect 
      and administer your records, accounts, and 
      funds; to comply with certain laws and 
      regulations; to help us design or improve our 
      products and services; and to understand your 
      financial needs so that we can provide you 
      with quality products and superior service. 
      Our <a href="useofinfo/">Use of Information 
      provisions</a> explain these concepts in 
      greater detail.<br><br>

      </li><li><b>Our Maintenance of Accurate 
      Information.</b> We have procedures to help 
      assure that your financial information is 
      accurate, current, and complete in accordance 
      with commercial standards. We also have 
      procedures to respond to your requests to correct 
      inaccurate information in a timely manner. While 
      some of these procedures are required by federal 
      or state law, we have implemented additional 
      procedures to maintain accurate, current, and 
      complete financial information, including 
      processes to update information and remove old 
      information.<br><br>

      </li><li><b>Limiting Employee Access to 
      Information.</b> We have procedures that limit 
      employee access to personally identifiable 
      information to those employees with a business 
      reason to know such information about you. We 
      educate our employees about the importance of 
      confidentiality and customer privacy through 
      standard operating procedures, special training 
      programs, and our policies on ethics. We take 
      appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce 
      employee privacy responsibilities.<br><br>

      </li><li><b>Security Procedures to Protect 
      Information.</b> We maintain security standards 
      and procedures to help prevent unauthorized 
      access to confidential information about you. We 
      update and test our technology to improve the 
      protection of our information about you and to 
      assure the integrity of our information.<br><br>

      </li><li><b>Restrictions on Disclosing Information 
      to Parties Outside Our Affiliated Banks and 
      Companies.</b> We do not reveal specific 
      information about your accounts or other 
      personally identifiable data to parties outside 
      our affiliated banks and companies for their 
      independent use unless: (1) you request or 
      authorize it; (2) the information is provided 
      to help complete a transaction initiated by 
      you; (3) the information is provided to a 
      reputable credit bureau or similar information 
      reporting agency; or (4) the disclosure 
      otherwise is lawfully permitted or required. 
      We do not provide account or personal 
      information to non-Wells Fargo companies for 
      the purpose of independent telemarketing or direct 
      mail marketing of any non-financial products or 
      services of those companies. Please see our 
      <a href="useofinfo/">Use of Information 
      provisions</a> for more information regarding 
      these concepts.<br><br>

      </li><li><b>Maintaining Your Privacy in Business 
      Relationships with Parties Outside Our 
      Affiliated Banks and Companies.</b> Sometimes it 
      is necessary to provide personally identifiable 
      information about you to a  party outside our 
      affiliated banks and companies, such as to a 
      vendor or service company that we hire to prepare 
      your account statements or to provide support or 
      services for one or more of our products. These 
      vendors and service companies agree to safeguard 
      our confidential information about you and your 
      products and services with us and must abide by 
      applicable law.<br><br>

      </li><li><b>Disclosing Our Privacy Commitment to 
      You.</b> We want you to understand our 
      commitment to personal privacy and our use of 
      information. For this reason, we have prepared 
      these Privacy Principles and the 
      <a href="useofinfo/">Use of Information 
      provisions</a>. These materials will answer most 
      of the important questions that you may have 
      about how we gather, protect, and use information.

      </li></ol><br>

    <p>
    These Privacy Principles apply to individuals, 
    and we reserve the right to change them, along 
    with related provisions, at any time.
