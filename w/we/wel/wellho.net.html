Personal and company information entered onto forms on this web site, and sent to us in email,
or provided to us in any other way will be used only by Well House Consultants and will not be 
disclosed to third parties (except if required by law - for example in a police investigation). 
This means that you will not receive mailings from other
companies as a result of being on our mailing list, and that your course reviews are
between yourself and Well House Consultants only.<p>
We accept credit card payment for courses by phone, fax, or in person.  
We also have a <a href="https://lightning.he.net/~wellho/net/secure.html">secure data page</a> through which you can give us credit card and other
sensitive information. For your own security, we request that you do NOT 
send us credit card details by email. 
We have chosen not to offer online booking facilities for courses, as 
we want to discuss your requirements individually with you to ensure
that what you're booking is appropriate.</p><p> 
We make very limited use of cookies on our site (to record which part of the
world you're in if you change your location, to record the font settings you
choose through our accessability options, in the
<a href="/net/catordog.php4">cat or dog demonstration</a>, and in the 
<a href="/regex/mousemat.php4">Regular Expression Mouse Mat</a> area). We check 
our web access logs to ensure the continuing integrity of our web sites, and 
we use
the limited marketing information that the logs provide within our company.
We do accept on line credit cards payments for purchases of mouse mats and pens,
but only though our secure server.  
</p><p>We do not retain your credit
card details in a database once payment has been taken. That applies to online
orders and also if you phone or fax your details in. You'll be asked for new 
details each time you pay by credit card.</p><p>
We provide you with a certificate of completion at the end of each course; please note that
this is not a certificate that you've achieved any particular standard in the subject being
taught.  We do not provide employers with an evaluation of any individual student on our
courses, unless the request has been made prior to the course and the student(s) concerned
are aware of and have agreed to the request.</p><p>
We are registered with the Data Protection Commissioner under the Data Protection Act, 1998.
