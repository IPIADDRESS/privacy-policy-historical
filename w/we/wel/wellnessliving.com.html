This Privacy Statement describes Wellness Living Systems Inc. (“WellnessLiving” or the “Company”) privacy practices in relation to the use of the Company’s Web site (http://www.wellnessliving.com) and the related applications and services offered by WellnessLiving (the “Services”).
<br><br>
The WellnessLiving Privacy policy affects three groups of users: Business Partners that subscribe to WellnessLiving services (“Subscribers”), the customers of WellnessLiving Subscribers (<font face="Times New Roman">“</font>Clients<font face="Times New Roman">”</font>) and visitors to our Company Web site. Collectively, these groups are referred to as <font face="Times New Roman">“</font>Users<font face="Times New Roman">”</font>. We treat our Users' information as if it were our own personal information. We do not sell, share or rent our users' personally identifiable information unless required by law. We do not send e-mail or other communications without user permission. We are committed to maintaining your continued privacy and constantly improving our service.
<br><br>
BY USING THE SITE, SERVICES, AND/OR BY REGISTERING WITH US, YOU ACCEPT THE PRACTICES AND POLICIES OUTLINED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AND YOU HEREBY CONSENT THAT WE WILL TRACK, COLLECT, USE, AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS.

<div class="rs-home-text-title">1. Web site covered</div>

This Privacy Statement covers the information practices of http://www.wellnessliving.com (the “Web Site”). The Web site may contain links to other Web sites. The information practices or the content of such other Web sites is governed by the privacy statements of such other Web sites. The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of other Web sites to understand their information practices.

<div class="rs-home-text-title">2. Information we collect</div>

WellnessLiving <b>Subscribers</b><br>
WellnessLiving asks new Subscribers to provide their name, business name, address, phone and e-mail address. We call this <font face="Times New Roman">“</font>Subscriber Information<font face="Times New Roman">”</font>. As a new subscriber, you will also be asked to provide payment information such as a credit card or bank account number, which is used for monthly billing purposes only. As part of WellnessLiving's service deployment process, your customers' personally identifiable information (<font face="Times New Roman">“</font>Client Information<font face="Times New Roman">”</font>) is uploaded into our secure servers. This process is performed so that WellnessLiving can provide our services to clients on your behalf. The collection of Subscriber Information and Client Information is done solely to provide our services to you in accordance with your Subscriber Agreement and Terms of Use.
<br><br>
In order for you to access certain areas of the Site or certain Services where it is important for us to know who you are so that we can best meet your needs, we may require you to provide us with certain information that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information includes the following categories of information: (a) contact data (such as your e-mail address, phone number); (b) demographic data (such as your gender, your date of birth, address and your postal/ zip code); (c) and any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to enjoy certain benefits of having an account with WellnessLiving. For example, only registered members are able to view their purchase history, book services, and earn reward points. The more information you provide us (and the more accurate it is) the better we are able to customize your experience on our website. If you communicate with us by, for example, e-mail or letter, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information.
<br><br> 
We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to other information about you. For example, if you visit WellnessLiving from a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then information about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us. As well, the information may be shared with other business partners if you choose to use their services.
 
<div class="rs-home-text-title">3. Cookies</div>

We may use small computer files that are transferred to your computer's hard drive that contain information such as user ID, user preferences, lists of pages visited and activities conducted while browsing the Site (“Cookies”) to help us improve our Site by tracking your navigation habits and to store some of your preferences.
