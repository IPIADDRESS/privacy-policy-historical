This Privacy Statement describes Wellness Living Systems Inc. (“WellnessLiving” or the “Company”) privacy practices in relation to the use of the Company’s Website (http://www.wellnessliving.com) and the related applications and services offered by WellnessLiving (collectively the “Software Services” or the “Software Service” or the “Website”).
<br><br>
The WellnessLiving Privacy policy affects three groups of users: Businesses that subscribe to WellnessLiving’s Software Services (“Subscribers”), the customers of Subscribers (“Clients”) and visitors to our Company Website. Collectively, these groups are referred to as “Users”. We treat our Users' information as if it were our own personal information. We do not sell, share or rent our users' personally identifiable information unless required by law. We do not send e-mail or other communications without user permission. We are committed to maintaining your continued privacy and constantly improving our service.
<br><br>
BY USING THE WEBSITE, SERVICES, AND/OR BY REGISTERING WITH US, YOU ACCEPT THE PRACTICES AND POLICIES OUTLINED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AND YOU HEREBY CONSENT THAT WE WILL TRACK, COLLECT, USE, AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS.

<div class="rs-home-text-title">1. Website covered</div>

This Privacy Statement covers the information practices of WellnessLiving. The Website may contain links to other websites. The information practices or the content of such other Websites is governed by the privacy statements of such other websites. The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of other websites to understand their information practices.

<div class="rs-home-text-title">2. Information we collect</div>

WellnessLiving asks new Subscribers to provide their name, business name, address, phone and e-mail address. We call this “Subscriber Information”. As a new subscriber, you will also be asked to provide payment information such as a credit card or bank account number, which is used for monthly billing purposes only. If you attend one of our events (e.g., a trade show), we may ask for your feedback, contact details or other information to follow-up with you, such as send you marketing communications consistent with your choices. As part of WellnessLiving's service deployment process, your customers' personally identifiable information, such as their name, email, phone number, address, and credit card information, as well as any other information your customers’ may provide, (“Client Information”) is uploaded into our secure servers. This process is performed so that WellnessLiving can provide our services to clients on your behalf. The collection of Subscriber Information and Client Information is done solely to provide our services to you in accordance with your Software Licensing Agreement.
<br><br>
In order for you to access certain areas of the Website or certain services where it is important for us to know who you are so that we can best meet your needs, we may require you to provide us with certain information that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information includes the following categories of information: (a) contact data (such as your e-mail address, phone number); (b) demographic data (such as your gender, your date of birth, address and your postal/zip code); (c) and any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to enjoy certain benefits of having an account with WellnessLiving. For example, only registered members are able to view their purchase history, book services, and earn reward points. The more information you provide us (and the more accurate it is) the better we are able to customize your experience on our website. If you communicate with us by, for example, e-mail or letter, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information.
<br><br> 
We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, Business Partners, social media pages and platforms and other independent third-party sources and add it to other information about you. For example, if you visit WellnessLiving from a site operated by one of our Business Partners, and you have registered with that partner, then information about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us. As well, the information may be shared with other Business Partners if you choose to use their services. We may also collect other Personal Information through the WellnessLiving Software Services under the direction of our Subscribers.
