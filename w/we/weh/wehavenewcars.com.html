	<p>As a part of our commitment to your privacy, we support and  adhere to the guidelines and practices adopted by the Direct Marketing  Association Privacy Promise to American consumers. Accordingly, we have agreed  to (1) provide customers with notice of their ability to opt out of information  exchanges with other marketers; (2) honor customer requests not to have their  information transferred to others for marketing purposes; and (3) accept and  honor customer requests not to receive solicitations from any of our brands.</p>

	<h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>

We have no control of or responsibility for linked websites and provide  these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors. You  access such linked Websites at your own risk. These websites are not subject to  this Privacy Policy. You should check the privacy policies, if any, of those  individual websites to see how the operators of those third-party websites will  utilize your personal information.

	<h3>What Information We May Collect</h3>
	<p>Generally, our customers and investors can visit our Website  without providing or revealing any personal or Personally Identifiable  Information. We receive and store certain types of information whenever  visitors interact with our Website. We may track the Internet domain address  from which our visitors visit our Website and analyze this data for trends and  statistics. Unless a visitor to our Website voluntarily provides Personally  Identifiable Information to us, each individual customer remains anonymous.</p>
	<p>We receive and may store certain Personally Identifiable  Information that our visitors enter when visiting our website or provide to us  in other ways. For instance, we collect the information you provide to us when  you place an order, register with us, send an email or call us, enter a  sweepstakes or contest, subscribe to a service, enroll in a club, request to  receive a catalog, or participate in a promotion. This information may include  your name, social security number, address, telephone number, email address,  birth date, gender, occupation, personal interests, and other similar personal  or preference data that you provide to us. It may also include information you  submit about other people. Whether or not you provide such information to us is  completely your own choice. However, your failure to provide such information  may prohibit your ability to fully use our services.</p>
	<p>We also collect Personally Identifiable Information of a  financial nature, such as your social security number and related financial  information, if you want to use our services to get automotive financing, as  such information is necessary for our affiliates to decide whether or not to  extend you credit for your automotive purchase.</p>

	<h3>Cookies</h3>
	<p>Our Website may send a "cookie" to your computer.  A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web  server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie cannot read data off  your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies do not  damage your system.

Most browser software can be set to reject  Cookies. However, if you reject our Cookies, certain functionality on our  Website may not work correctly or at all. We do not place Personally  Identifiable Information in Cookies.</p>

	<h3>Web Beacons</h3>
	<p>We may also use web beacons to collect Non-Personal  Information about your use of our Website and the Websites of selected sponsors  and advertisers, and your use of special promotions or newsletters. The information  collected by Web Beacons (a) allows us to statistically monitor how many people  open our emails and (b) for what purposes these actions are being taken. Our  Web Beacons are not used to track your activity outside of our Websites or  those of our sponsors'. We do not link Non-Personal Information from Web  Beacons to Personally Identifiable Information without your permission.</p>

	<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
	<p>We use the personal and/or Personally Identifiable  Information you provide for our internal purposes, such as providing you  services, analyzing trends and statistics, and informing you of our new  products/services (including those of our affiliates).</p>
	<p>To serve you better, we may combine the information you give  us online and information we receive from others. We use that combined  information to enhance and personalize your experience with us, to communicate  with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for  other promotional purposes.</p>
	<p>Also, we may contract with third-party service providers to  provide certain services for our business, such as processing your financial  information to determine credit-worthiness, credit card processing, computer  system services, data management, or promotional services. We provide the  information needed for these service providers to perform these services. The  information we provide may include some of our customers' personal and  Personally Identifiable Information. However, these service providers are not  authorized to use any of the information we share with them for any purposes  other than to provide services to us.</p>
	<p>You understand that if you are seeking automotive financing,  you may have one or more credit reports pulled by those of our affiliates who  would offer you automotive financing or assist in the determination of  providing you automotive financing.</p>
	<p>We may share information that we have collected with  governmental agencies and other organizations assisting us in fraud prevention  or for investigative purposes. We may do so when permitted or mandated by law;  trying to protect against or prevent fraud; attempting to prevent unauthorized  or improper transactions; or investigating fraud or improper conduct that has  already taken place. In these instances, the information is not provided to these  agencies or organizations for marketing or any other unrelated purposes.</p>
	<p>Additionally, we may share your email address, name,  telephone number, and postal address within the Synergy Media, Inc.  family of businesses. Also, when you make requests for information through our  Website we may need to contact you via phone, email, or mail to address issues  specific to your order, even if you have opted to not receive communications  from us.</p>
	<p>From time to time we may also market certain third-party services  through our Website. Should you choose to accept an offer from a third-party,  we will pass your relevant Personally Identifiable Information, including your  name, postal address, and any other required information to that specific  third-party.</p>
	<p>Generally, we will only retain Personally Identifiable  Information as long as needed to provide you with services. However, there may  be times where due to the nature of services you requested, we may archive your  Personally Identifiable Information for future use.</p>
	<p>Finally, if some or all of the business assets of any our  company are sold or transferred, we generally would transfer the corresponding  information regarding our customers and visitors to the purchaser. We also may  retain a copy of that information.</p>

	<h3>Exemptions from Privacy Policy</h3>
	<p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may  send to us by email or instant messaging programs (i.e. AOL, Yahoo, etc.), as  email and instant messages are not recognized as a secure communication forms.  As such, we request that you do not send any information, which you consider  private, to us by email or instant message. Likewise, our Website has forums,  message boards, and other posting areas that are open to the general public.  Anything posted on such forums, message boards, or other posting areas will not  be private in any fashion. As such, take special care in posting information,  especially when you consider such information to be of a private nature.</p>

	<h3>Sponsors and Advertisers</h3>
	<p>Sponsors or advertisers on our Website may use their own  Cookies, Web Beacons or other online tracking technologies in the banner  advertisements on our Website, in emails, special promotions or newsletters we  send you. Some advertisers use companies other than our Website to serve their  ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies ("Ad  Servers") may also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of  Cookies or Web Beacons on our Website. In certain situations, information  collection may be facilitated by momentarily directing your browser to the  website of an Ad Server or other third party acting on behalf of the sponsor,  partner, or advertiser before re-directing your browser to its selected  destination (e.g., back to our Website to show the ad, or to the advertiser's  website); this re-direction process will not be apparent to you.</p>
	<p>We do not control these third parties' use of cookies or Web  Beacons, or how they manage the Non-Personal Information they gather through  them. However, we do require sponsors, advertisers and Ad Servers who collect  cookie or web beacon information through our Website to agree that they will  not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from our Website without  your consent. They must agree that they will not link any cookie or web beacon  information collected by them on our Website to Personally Identifiable  Information that they or others have collected in other ways or from other  sites except as may be described in connection with a particular program.</p>

	<h3>Opting Out of Sharing Information</h3>
	<p>You may opt out of future unaffiliated third-party  disclosures of your information. Such opt-out will not affect disclosures  otherwise permitted by law including but not limited to: (i) disclosures to  affiliates, (ii) disclosures to third-party service providers who provide  certain services for our business, such as credit card processing, computer  system services, shipping, data management, or promotional services, (iii)  disclosures to third parties as necessary to fulfill your requests, (iv)  disclosures to governmental agencies or law enforcement departments or  otherwise required to be made under applicable law, (v) previously completed  disclosures to third parties, or (vi) disclosures to third parties in  connection with subsequent contests or promotions you may choose to enter, or  third-party offers you may choose to accept.</p>

If you are under the age of 18, please seek the permission of a parent or  guardian before placing an order.

	<h3>Our Security Policy</h3>
	<p>Because we all benefit from secure online environments, we  have taken steps to build and manage a system that you can use with confidence.  We use sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to protect the  security of the Personally Identifiable Information that you share with us. If  sensitive data is collected through this Website, we will encrypt your  Personally Identifiable Information before it travels over the Internet using  industry standards for secure online transactions. The Personally Identifiable  Information you provide to us is preserved behind a firewall, instead of being  directly connected to the Internet. Unfortunately, no data transmission over  the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Once we receive your  transmission, we have appropriate security measures in place within our  physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the  Personally Identifiable Information you have provided to us.</p>
	<p>We urge you to keep your password, if any, for our Website  in a safe place and not divulge it to anyone. Also remember to sign off your  account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit to our  Website. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially  if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a  public place such as a library or Internet cafe.</p>

	<h3>Use of Credit Cards</h3>
	<p>You may have to provide a credit card to purchase other  products and services from our Website. We use third-party billing services and  HAVE NO CONTROL over these services. We will use our best efforts to make sure  that your credit card number is kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL by using only  third-party billing services that use industry-standard encryption technology  to protect your credit card number from unauthorized use. However, you  understand and agree that we are in no way responsible for any misuse of your  credit card number.</p>

	<h3>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>
	<p>From time to time, our privacy and security practices may  change. If we modify our Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, to address these  changes, we will indicate when such changes are made by changing the "Last  Updated" date at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. Those changes will  be effective as of the Last Updated date. The new policy will apply to all  current and past users of our Websites and will replace any prior policies that  are inconsistent. We may change or add to this Privacy Policy, so we encourage  you to review it periodically.</p>
