<h4>Use of cookies</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your device. Most big websites do this too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>What are cookies?</strong>
<br>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don't have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>How do we use cookies?</strong>
<br>
<p>Weenysoft.com does not use any first-party cookies require consent. Our website uses third party services such as advertising from Google Adsense that may use cookies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Google Adsense cookies</strong>
<br>
<p>On our website, we use the functions of the online advertising service Google AdSense. Google AdSense is a service of Google Inc. ("Google"), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. 
Google AdSense is a Google service that displays Google advertisements from advertisers on third-party websites. By integrating Google AdSense we provide Google with appropriate advertising space on our website.</p>
<p>Google AdSense uses so-called "cookies", which are text files that are saved on your device and that enabled the website to conduct an analysis of the websites you visited. Google AdSense may also use so-called web beacons (invisible graphics). Via these web beacons, information such as the visitor traffic on the pages of this offer can be evaluated. The information generated by cookies and web beacons about the usage of our website (including your IP address) and the delivery of advertising formats will be transmitted to and stored by a Google server that might be located in the USA or other third countries. This way, Google can reconstruct on which websites the usage of advertising media took place in order to be able to allocate a commission to the website operator.</p>
<p>The following information (including personal data) might be processed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your web request</li>
<li>Your IP address</li>
<li>Your browser type</li>
<li>Your browser language</li>
<li>The date and time of your request</li>
<li>One or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have the right to object. To do so, you can prevent the acquisition of the data generated by the cookies (including your IP address) by Google as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a></p>
<p>In addition, you have the possibility to deactivate the interest-based ads from Google according to the instructions in the following link: <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>DoubleClick cookies</strong>
<br>
<p>We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google's DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests ("interest based targeting").</p>
<p>The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey).  DART uses "non personally identifiable information". It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.</p>
<p>You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Non-personalized ads for users in the EEA</strong>
<br>
<p>We have set Google AdSense to show all users in the EEA (European Economic Area) only non-personalized ads.</p>
<p>Non-personalized ads are targeted using contextual information rather than the past behavior of a user. Although these ads don't use cookies for ads personalization, they do use cookies to allow for frequency capping, aggregated ad reporting, and to combat fraud and abuse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>How to control cookies?</strong>
<br>
<p>You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – for details, see <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">aboutcookies.org</a>.</p> You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Right of objection</strong>
<br>
