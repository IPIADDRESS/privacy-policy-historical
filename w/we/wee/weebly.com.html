				    <h3>1. What This Privacy Notice Covers</h3>
				    <p>This notice covers how Weebly, Inc., a U.S. company ("Weebly," "we," "us," or "our") treats personal information
				        that
				        it collects and receives from its website (www.weebly.com), website hosting and design services, communication
				        tools, mobile applications, app marketplace, ecommerce tools, and other services (collectively, the
				        “Service”).</p>
				    <p>We are not in the business of selling personal information about you. We use information shared with us for the
				        purpose of running and improving our Service and in that capacity will operate as a data controller and, to the
				        extent we process data, a data processor.</p>
				    <p>This notice tells you what information we collect, steps we take to protect and secure it, how we use and share
				        information, and finally, how you can contact us with questions or concerns.</p>
				    <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
				    <p><strong>(a) Personal Information.</strong>&nbsp;We collect personal information (e.g., name, email address, phone
				        number,
				        etc.) when you:</p>
				    <ul>
				        <li>register an account with us;</li>
				        <li>contact our customer support services;</li>
				        <li>sign-up as, or are invited to be, a member of a Pro or Business account user’s site;</li>
				        <li>are referred to us through our “invite a friend” referral feature;</li>
				        <li>enter our promotions, contests, or sweepstakes;</li>
				        <li>post content on a Weebly website or blog;</li>
				        <li>sign-up to be an App Developer; and</li>
				        <li>post an App review in our App Marketplace</li>
				    </ul>
				    <p><strong>(b) Other User Information.</strong>&nbsp;When you access and use our Service, we automatically collect and
				        store
				        in log files your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit
				        pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, and other user information as part of our Service
				        analytics (individually and collectively, “Automatically Collected Information”) to analyze trends in the
				        aggregate
				        and administer the Service. We use mobile application platform permissions when collecting other information
				        from
				        you. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.</p>
				    <p><strong>(c) Billing Information.</strong>&nbsp;If you sign up for a Weebly Starter, Pro, or Business account, register
				        a
				        domain through us, or purchase another paid service, we require your billing information in order to process the
				        transaction. Billing information includes your name, address, telephone number, credit card details, PayPal
				        email
				        address, and other information necessary to process the transaction.</p>
				    <p>We will retain the last 4 digits of your credit card number, credit card type, name, address, and some other
				        billing
				        information, so that you may identify that card used in the future. Weebly does not store your full credit card
				        number or CVV2; this information is discarded after your transaction has been processed.</p>
				    <p>If your subscription is auto-renewing, our authorized payment processor will store your payment information on
				        their
				        secure payment gateway for as long as necessary to carry out the terms of your subscription.</p>
				    <p>All transactions are processed over an industry standard SSL/TLS connection, with a minimum of 128-bit
				        encryption.</p>
				    <p><strong>(d) Cookies and Tracking Technologies.</strong>&nbsp;Weebly and our affiliates, partners, and service
				        providers
				        (such as marketing, analytics, and customer support partners) use cookies and similar technologies for analyzing
				        trends, site administration, tracking mobile application installations, and understanding how users interface
				        with
				        our site(s), and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based
				        on
				        the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and in an aggregated basis.</p>

				    <p><strong>(e) Third Party Analytics Services.</strong>&nbsp;Some parts of our Service use third party analytic services
				        to help us create a better user experience.</p>
				    <ul>
				        <li>Flurry. You can opt-out of Flurry’s mobile analytics service at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flurry.com/legal-privacy/end-user-opt-out">Flurry Opt-Out</a>. The opt-out is
				            specific to
				            Flurry
				            activities and does not affect the activities of other ad networks or analytics providers we may use. When
				            you
				            opt-out, Flurry will stop tracking data for the device identified by the provided MAC address and/or device
				            identifier going forward and Flurry analytics tracking will stop across all applications within the Flurry
				            network.
				        </li>
				        <li>Google. For the web, visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics opt-out
				                page</a>&nbsp;and install the add-on for your specific
				            browser.
				            For
				            our mobile applications, you can opt-out using our “Privacy Opt-Out” settings within our applications.
				        </li>
				        <li>Google Tag Manager. You can opt-out of Google Tag Manager’s mobile service by using our “Privacy Opt-Out”
				            settings
				            within our applications.
				        </li>
				    </ul>
				    <p><strong>(f) Do Not Track.</strong>&nbsp;Currently, we do not support Do Not Track or “DNT.” DNT is a preference you
				        set in
				        your web browser to tell visited websites you do not want to be tracked. You can enable or disable DNT through
				        the
				        preferences or settings of your web browser.</p>
				    <p><strong>(g) Mobile App.</strong> When you download and use the Service through our mobile app, we automatically
				        collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or
				        "UDID").
				    </p>
				    <p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of the Service on your
				        device.
				        This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the
				        application, aggregated usage, content, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.</p>
				    <p>We may also send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about events or promotions. If
				        you
				        no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure
				        that
				        you receive proper notifications, we need to collect certain information about your device such as operating
				        system
				        and user identification information.</p>
				    <h3>3. Legal Ability to Enter Into Contracts</h3>
				    <p>You are prohibited from creating or using a Weebly account if you are not legally capable of entering into
				        contracts,
				        for example, if you are not the age of majority in your country or region. If you are not the age of majority in
				        your country or region, you may only create or use a Weebly account with the supervision and consent of a parent
				        or
				        guardian or alternatively through a special student account created by a teacher through&nbsp;<a href="http://education.weebly.com/">education.weebly.com</a>,

				        with
				        other information we collect about you to improve site functionality and the services we offer you, and for
				        Service
				        and internal marketing analytics.</p>

				    <ul>

				            with
