					<ol type="1">
						<li>We collect information on Users in order to facilitate the operation of the Weedle

						<li>The User consents and knowingly chooses to disclose all information that is uploaded
							to the Weedle Platform in the form of a User Profile. When you add to your User
							Profile with further information about yourself, you agree that any registration
							information you give to Weedle will always be accurate, correct and up to date.
						</li>
						<li>The Weedle Search Facility is available to all Users. Users are also invited to
							enter personal information which provides an enhanced set of search results.

						<ol type="a">
							<li>When you sign up for a Weedle User Profile Account or other Weedle services or promotions
								that require registration, we ask you for personal information. For certain services,
								such as our advertising programs, we also request credit card or other payment account
								information, which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine
								the information that you submit under your account with information from other Weedle
								services, in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality
								of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out
								of combining such information. </li>
							<li>Weedle provides an invitation service when you register with the Platform. If you
								choose (consent or opt in) to use our invitation service to tell a contact about
								our site, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as
								your contacts email address or we will ask you to consent to having your contact
								list(s) imported. We will send your contacts an email or instant message in your
								name inviting him or her to visit the site, and may send reminders to them. Weedle
								stores this information to send invitations and reminders, to register a contact
								connection if your invitation is accepted, to allow you to see invitations you have
								sent and to track the success of our referral program. All information that you
								enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this privacy
								policy as cover your own information. Weedle also stores this information (imported
								contacts information) to avoid duplication of contacts and to check when contacts,
								not invited by the User, join the Weedle Platform through registration. Weedle will
								also store the User’s access details in order to synch the contacts whenever the
								User logs in.</li>
							<li>When you visit Weedle, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information
								is gathered for all Weedle Users. In addition, we store certain information from

								tied to information about the User. We send cookies to your computer or other device
								that uniquely identifies your browser. We use session ID cookies to confirm that

								the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify
								your browser. </li>
							<li>When you use Weedle, you may set up your User Profile, form community networks,
								send messages, perform searches and queries, set up events, add applications, transmit
								information through various channels and send emails or other communications to
								Weedle. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer
								personalised features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can
								return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your community network
								list. When you update information, we usually keep a back-up copy of the prior version
								for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that
								information.</li>

								is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the application
								or gadget provider is governed by their privacy policies. </li>

					</ol>
					<li><b>USE OF INFORMATION OBTAINED BY WEEDLE</b></li>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>When you register with Weedle, you create your own User Profile. We may occasionally
							use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services
							offered by Weedle that we think you may find valuable.</li>
						<li>User Profile information is used by Weedle primarily to be presented back to and
							edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to all. </li>
						<li>The User Profile information that you submit to Weedle will be available to all
							Users of the Weedle Platform. All User Profile information will be available in

							information without registering with the Weedle Platform. </li>
						<li>User Profile information is used by Weedle to improve the functionality of the Weedle
							Platform. </li>
						<li>Weedle may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the

						<li>Generally, you may opt out of such emails through your User Account Settings. Weedle
							reserves the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of
							all voluntary email notifications.</li>
						<li>Weedle may use information in your User Profile without identifying you as an individual
							to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people are
							in a network like a group of electricians, and also personalising advertisements
							and promotions so that we can provide you with up to date Weedle promotions and
							sponsors of community groupings. We believe this benefits you. We may use information
							about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers
							and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, Weedle Platform
							developers and other Users of Weedle, to supplement your User Profile. Where such
							information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your User Account Settings
							that you do not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection
							of this information to your User Profile (e.g. removing photo tag links).</li>

					<li><b>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</b></li>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>Weedle is about sharing catalogued skill information with Users. We do not provide

							your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe
							such sharing is (1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, (2) legally required
							or (3) permitted by you. </li>
						<li>We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services
							we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business. In
							connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may
							have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection
							with these business activities. Where we utilise third parties for the processing
							of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections
							limiting the use of that information to the Weedle-specified purposes. This site
							uses various analytics services to monitor and improve the quality and usability
							of the Weedle Platform.</li>
						<li>If you, your contacts or members of your community network use any third-party applications
							developed using the Weedle Platform (“Platform Applications”), those Platform Applications
							may access and share certain information about you with others. You may opt out
							of any sharing of certain or all information through Platform Applications. In addition,
							third-party developers who have created and operate Platform Applications (“Platform
							Developers”), may also have access to your personal information (including your
							contact information) if you permit Platform Applications to access your data. Before
							allowing any Platform Developer to make any Platform Application available to you,
							Weedle requires the Platform Developer to enter into an agreement which, among other
							things, requires them to respect your privacy settings and strictly limits their
							collection, use and storage of your information. However, while we have undertaken
							contractual and technical steps to restrict possible misuse of such information
							by such Platform Developers, we cannot and do not guarantee that all Platform Developers
							will abide by such agreements. Please note that Weedle does not screen or approve
							Platform Developers and cannot control how such Platform Developers use any personal
							information that they may obtain in connection with Platform Applications. In addition,
							Platform Developers may require you to sign up to their own terms of service, privacy
							policies or other policies, which may give them additional rights or impose additional
							obligations on you. </li>
						<li>We may be required to disclose User information pursuant to lawful requests, such
							as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal
							information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law
							enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally,
							we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply
							with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal
							activity perpetrated through the Weedle service or using the Weedle name, or to
							prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies,
							lawyers, agents or government agencies.</li>
						<li>We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers
							through on-site offers.</li>
						<li>You can share your Weedle information with outside applications and websites to
							make your experiences on those applications and websites better and more commercial.</li>
						<li>We are not responsible for any third party applications and websites that you interact
							with through the Weedle Platform. </li>
						<li>If you allow an application or website to connect with your Weedle account, that
							application or website can access information on Weedle related to you and your
							contacts and generate and publish stories about actions you take on that application
							or website without any additional permission. An application or website that you
							connect with can generally access the same information that you can see about yourself
							and your contacts, and an application or website that your contacts connect with
							can access the same information about you that the contacts can see.</li>
						<li>You can report any suspected misuse of the Weedle Platform to us, and we will investigate
							the claim and take appropriate action.</li>
						<li>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Weedle business, or individual
							business units owned by Weedle Holdings Limited, were to change, your User information
							may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any
							such transfer of information, your User information would remain subject to the
