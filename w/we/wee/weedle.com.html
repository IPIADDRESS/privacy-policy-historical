								When you sign up for a Weedle User Profile Account or other Weedle services or promotions
								that require registration, we ask you for personal information. For certain services,

								information, which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine
								the information that you submit under your account with information from other Weedle

								of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out
								of combining such information. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Weedle provides an invitation service when you register with the Platform. If you
								choose (consent or opt in) to use our invitation service to tell a contact about
								our site, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as
								your contacts email address or we will ask you to consent to having your contact
								list(s) imported. We will send your contacts an email or instant message in your
								name inviting him or her to visit the site, and may send reminders to them. Weedle
								stores this information to send invitations and reminders, to register a contact
								connection if your invitation is accepted, to allow you to see invitations you have
								sent and to track the success of our referral program. All information that you
								enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this privacy
								policy as cover your own information. Weedle also stores this information (imported
								contacts information) to avoid duplication of contacts and to check when contacts,
								not invited by the User, join the Weedle Platform through registration. Weedle will
								also store the User’s access details in order to synch the contacts whenever the
								User logs in.

							<li>
								When you visit Weedle, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information

								for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that
								information.

					<li>
						Weedle only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy

				<div class="borderBottomGray">USE OF INFORMATION OBTAINED BY WEEDLE</div>
				<ol class="sub marginTop">
					<li>
						When you register with Weedle, you create your own User Profile. We may occasionally
						use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services
						offered by Weedle that we think you may find valuable.
					</li>
					<li>
						User Profile information is used by Weedle primarily to be presented back to and
						edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to all. 
					</li>
					<li>
						The User Profile information that you submit to Weedle will be available to all
						Users of the Weedle Platform. All User Profile information will be available in
						search results generated for Users and may be made available to third-party search
						engines. People who see your name in searches will be able to access your User Profile
						information without registering with the Weedle Platform. 
					</li>
					<li>
						User Profile information is used by Weedle to improve the functionality of the Weedle Platform. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Weedle may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the
						general operation of the service. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Generally, you may opt out of such emails through your User Account Settings. Weedle
						reserves the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of
						all voluntary email notifications.
					</li>
					<li>
						Weedle may use information in your User Profile without identifying you as an individual
						to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people are
						in a network like a group of electricians, and also personalising advertisements
						and promotions so that we can provide you with up to date Weedle promotions and
						sponsors of community groupings. We believe this benefits you. We may use information
						about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers
						and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, Weedle Platform
						developers and other Users of Weedle, to supplement your User Profile. Where such
						information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your User Account Settings
						that you do not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection
						of this information to your User Profile (e.g. removing photo tag links).

				<div class="borderBottomGray">SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</div>
				<ol class="sub marginTop">
					<li>
						Weedle is about sharing catalogued skill information with Users. We do not provide
						your contact information to third-party marketers without your permission. We share
						your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe
						such sharing is (1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, (2) legally required
						or (3) permitted by you. 
					</li>
					<li>
						We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services
						we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business. In
						connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may
						have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection
						with these business activities. Where we utilise third parties for the processing
						of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections
						limiting the use of that information to the Weedle-specified purposes. This site
						uses various analytics services to monitor and improve the quality and usability
						of the Weedle Platform.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you, your contacts or members of your community network use any third-party applications
						developed using the Weedle Platform (“Platform Applications”), those Platform Applications
						may access and share certain information about you with others. You may opt out
						of any sharing of certain or all information through Platform Applications. In addition,
						third-party developers who have created and operate Platform Applications (“Platform
						Developers”), may also have access to your personal information (including your
						contact information) if you permit Platform Applications to access your data. Before
						allowing any Platform Developer to make any Platform Application available to you,
						Weedle requires the Platform Developer to enter into an agreement which, among other
						things, requires them to respect your privacy settings and strictly limits their
						collection, use and storage of your information. However, while we have undertaken
						contractual and technical steps to restrict possible misuse of such information
						by such Platform Developers, we cannot and do not guarantee that all Platform Developers
						will abide by such agreements. Please note that Weedle does not screen or approve
						Platform Developers and cannot control how such Platform Developers use any personal
						information that they may obtain in connection with Platform Applications. In addition,
						Platform Developers may require you to sign up to their own terms of service, privacy
						policies or other policies, which may give them additional rights or impose additional
						obligations on you. 
					</li>
					<li>
						We may be required to disclose User information pursuant to lawful requests, such
						as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal
						information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law
						enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally,
						we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply
						with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal
						activity perpetrated through the Weedle service or using the Weedle name, or to
						prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies,
						lawyers, agents or government agencies.
					</li>
					<li>
						We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers
						through on-site offers.
					</li>
					<li>
						You can share your Weedle information with outside applications and websites to
						make your experiences on those applications and websites better and more commercial.
					</li>
					<li>
						We are not responsible for any third party applications and websites that you interact
						with through the Weedle Platform. 
					</li>
					<li>
						If you allow an application or website to connect with your Weedle account, that
						application or website can access information on Weedle related to you and your
						contacts and generate and publish stories about actions you take on that application
						or website without any additional permission. An application or website that you
						connect with can generally access the same information that you can see about yourself
						and your contacts, and an application or website that your contacts connect with
						can access the same information about you that the contacts can see.
					</li>
					<li>
						You can report any suspected misuse of the Weedle Platform to us, and we will investigate
						the claim and take appropriate action.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Weedle business, or individual
						business units owned by Weedle Holdings Limited, were to change, your User information
						may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any
						such transfer of information, your User information would remain subject to the
						promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.

				<div class="borderBottomGray">THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING</div>
				<p>
					Advertisements that appear on Weedle are sometimes delivered (or “served”) directly
					to Users by third-party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address
					when this happens. These third-party advertisers may also download cookies to your
					computer or use other technologies such as JavaScript and “web beacons” (also known
					as “1x1 gifs”) to measure the effectiveness of their adverts and to personalise
					advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognise your
					computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness
					of their adverts and to personalise advertising content. In this way, they may compile
					information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements
					and determine which advertisements are clicked. Weedle does not have access to or
					control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party advertisers.
				</p>
				<p>
					This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Weedle and does not cover the use
					of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.

				<div class="borderBottomGray">CHANGING OR REMOVING INFORMATION</div>

					Access and control over most personal information on Weedle is readily available

					who wish to deactivate their Weedle account may do so through your User Account
					Settings. Removed information may persist in back-up copies for a reasonable period
					of time but will not be generally available to Users of Weedle.
				</p>

					Where you make use of the communication features of the service to share information
					with other individuals on Weedle, however, (e.g. sending a personal message to another
					Weedle User) you generally cannot remove such communications.

						by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual Users to identify
						themselves and the information that they request be accessed, corrected or removed
						before processing such requests and we may decline to process requests that are
						unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort,
						jeopardise the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance,
