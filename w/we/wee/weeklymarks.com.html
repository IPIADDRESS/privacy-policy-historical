			may supply to us through your conduct on the web site.</p>
			<br><p align="justify">We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify or remove portions of this Internet Privacy Policy at any time. This 
			Internet Privacy Policy is in addition to any other terms and conditions applicable to the web site. We do not make any

			<br><p align="justify">We recognise the importance of protecting the privacy of information collected about visitors to our web site, in 
			particular information that is capable of identifying an individual ("personal information"). This Internet Privacy Policy 
			governs the manner in which your personal information, obtained through the web site, will be dealt with. This Internet 
			Privacy Policy should be reviewed periodically so that you are updated on any changes. We welcome your comments and

			<br><strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
			<p align="justify">Personal information about visitors to our site is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. For example, 
			we may need to collect such information to provide you with further services or to answer or forward any requests or

			information when we believe in good faith that the law requires disclosure.<br>
			We may engage third parties to provide you with goods or services on our behalf. In that circumstance, we may disclose 
			your personal information to those third parties in order to meet your request for goods or services.</p>
			<br><strong>Security</strong><br>
			<p align="justify">We strive to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personal information submitted to our sites, and we review and 
			update our security measures in light of current technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can

			<p align="justify">Cookies are data that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies, which are 
			industry standard and are used by most Web sites, including those operated by us, can facilitate a user's ongoing access 
			to and use of a site. They allow us to customise the web site to your needs. If you do not want information collected 
			through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the Cookie 
			feature. But you should note that Cookies may be necessary to provide you with some features of our on-line services.</p>
			<br><strong>Access to Information</strong><br>
