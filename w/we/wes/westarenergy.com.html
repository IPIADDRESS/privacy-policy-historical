<p><font face="Arial">Westar Energy is committed to safeguarding your privacy on its Web site located at www.wr.com. This Westar Energy Privacy Policy does not apply to products or services provided, or information obtained, other than through the Web site. Please read the following policy to understand how your information will be treated. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. Please keep in mind that some of the services mentioned specifically in this policy may not be available on the site at this time.  If you have questions concerning this policy, please contact </font><a href="mailto:corp_com@wr.com"><font face="Arial">Westar Energy</font></a><font face="Arial">.  </font>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial">What information does Westar Energy collect from me?</font></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Westar Energy collects information in several ways. For example, some personal information is gathered when you register as a customer using our online account access. During registration, we ask for your Westar Energy account number and your e-mail address. Once you register, you are no longer anonymous to Westar Energy and are able to take full advantage of our services. In addition to registration, we may ask you for information at other times, such as when you report a problem with our site or services, or contact the company via the corporate e-mail address. If you contact Westar Energy, we may keep a record of that correspondence. </font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">If you believe that any inaccurate or inappropriate information has been obtained or disseminated through your use of this Web site, you should contact a representative of Westar Energy at corpcom@wr.com.</font>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial">What are cookies and how does Westar Energy use them?</font></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial">As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, many Web sites use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive.  We use cookies to allow faster and easier access to your account information, monitor traffic on the site and measure traffic patterns to improve functionality.  Web pages may in the future contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called clear gifs or Web bugs) or other advanced technologies that are useful in the provision of services to you.</font>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial">How does Westar Energy use the information?</font></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Westar Energy’s primary goal in collecting information is to improve the site and provide the user with the best possible experience on the site. For example, by using the information collected, we are able to provide you with an easy to use and readily available forum to access your Westar Energy account information.  We will also use your personal information to allow you to pay your Westar Energy bills online and to notify you of other products or services available from Westar Energy and its affiliates.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Only Westar Energy and its affiliates will have access to individuals’ account information. We also may do research on our users’ demographics and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, gathered from transaction activity, from our server log files or from surveys. This research may be compiled, analyzed or sold on an aggregated basis, which does not include information identifying individual users. Westar Energy also may share this aggregated data with business partners or other third parties. </font>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial">Who is collecting information?</font></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial">When you are on a Westar Energy site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Westar Energy and its affiliates and service providers. If personal data is to be collected and/or maintained by any company other than Westar Energy or its affiliates, we will attempt to notify you on the Web site or in an updated version of this Privacy Policy. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. </font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Please be aware that other Web sites to which we link may collect personally identifiable information about you when you visit those sites. The information practices of other Web sites linked to www.wr.com are not covered by this Privacy Policy. </font>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial">With whom does Westar Energy share my information?</font></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial">We will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed. </font>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial">Data in the Aggregate</font></b><font face="Arial">: We may disclose “blinded” aggregated data and user statistics to prospective partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. Blinded data is data that does not identify an individual person.</font>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial">Other</font></b><font face="Arial">: We also may disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Westar Energy’s Terms and Conditions of Use, or may otherwise be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Westar Energy’s rights or property, other Westar Energy Web site users or customers, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service and improve our products and services. </font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging and mailing, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail, providing investor information and processing data.  We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">As we continue to develop our business, we may buy or sell businesses or assets. In such transactions, confidential customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event of a transaction involving the sale of some or all of Westar Energy’s businesses, customer and site visitor information may be one of the transferred assets.</font>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial">How does Westar Energy protect financial-related information?</font></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Keeping your personal financial information private is vitally important to us. As a matter of policy and long-time business practice, Westar Energy does not sell information provided by its customers. Any user statistics that we may provide to prospective partners regarding financial matters are provided in the aggregate only and do not include any personally identifiable information about any individual user. We will transfer your credit card number, bank account number or other personal information to the appropriate credit card company or bank in order to process any online payments of your Westar Energy Customer Account.</font>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial">What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of my information?</font></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Your Westar Energy Account Information and Westar Energy Profile are password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information. We use encryption technology for credit card numbers, bank account numbers, passwords and registration information. Remember to sign out of your Westar Energy account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account by using your computer when you are away from it. Because of the global nature of the Internet, when you give us information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country where you originally entered the information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Except as discussed above or otherwise designated, this site does not use security encryption measures. Therefore, information that you disclose by use of this site (as with any site that is non-secure), by posting a message or using e-mail, potentially could be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties or use of such information by third parties for their own purposes, legal or illegal. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Westar Energy cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we use our best efforts to ensure its security on our systems. </font>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial">What else should I know about my privacy?</font></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose information online, that information is accessible to other customers and users. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. </font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">When you or we end your customer relationship with us, we will treat the information we have about you as if you were still our customer. </font></p></td></tr>
