<ul>
    <li>Your Internet browser.</li>
    <li>Your computer's operating system.</li>
    <li>Your navigation path, including the domain name of the website that linked you to our site and which of our pages you visited.</li>
    <li>When you view one of our web sites, we may store cookies on your computer. These cookies allow us to tailor a web site or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. With most Internet browsers you can block cookies, receive a warning about cookies, or erase all cookies from your hard drive. Please refer to your browser instructions or Help screen to learn more about these functions. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</li>
    <li>The use of cookies by our tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.</li>
    <li>Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</li>
    <li>Targeted or Behavioral Advertising:<br>
    Targeted advertising (also known as Behavioral Advertising) uses information collected on an individual's web browsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is then used to select which Alta College advertisement should be displayed to a particular individual on websites other than an Alta Colleges site. For example, if you have shown a preference for nursing while visiting Alta Colleges.com, you may be served an advertisement from Alta Colleges.com for nursing related programs when you visit a site other than Alta Colleges.com. The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number. The information used for targeted advertising either comes from an Alta Colleges site or through third party website publishers. If you would like to opt out of targeted advertising from Alta Colleges that occurs when visiting our third party advertising publishers, please <a title="TRUSTe opt-out" target="_blank" href="http://preferences.truste.com/truste/">click here</a>. Please note that this will opt you out of targeted ads from Alta Colleges and any other participating advertisers. If you opt out, you will continue to receive online advertising from Alta Colleges; however, these ads may not be as relevant to you.</li>
</ul>
