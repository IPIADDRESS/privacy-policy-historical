    <ul>
      <li>In connection with competitions or signing up to email or mobile newsletters, customers provide us with their contact details. Westfield collects these details to contact competition winners, and to inform customers about Westfield events, activities and promotions, both in centre and as part of Westfield's other activities. Customers have the option to opt out from receiving this information.</li>

When entering Westfield shopping centres and car parks, customer's personal information and images may be collected by Westfield, and Westfield may collect customer's personal information and images from third parties (for example, the police or retailers). This information may be used by Westfield in connection with the management and security of the Westfield shopping centres and may be provided to law enforcement and government bodies, Westfield staff and subcontractors, insurers and retailers for those purposes.
