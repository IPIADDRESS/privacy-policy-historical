  <div style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px; padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px;">
    <p>Westgate Resorts has a strong commitment to providing excellent service to all of our customers and visitors of our Web sites, including respecting your concerns about privacy. We understand that you may have questions about how we collect and use the information that you provide to us.

	<p>This Statement contains numerous general and technical details about the steps we take to respect your privacy concerns. We have organized the Statement by major processes and areas so that you can review the information of most interest to you.</p>
	<p>At Westgate, meeting your needs and expectations form the foundation of everything we do--including protecting your privacy.</p>
	<p>If, after reviewing this Statement, you have any questions or privacy concerns please send a letter to:</p>
	<p>Westgate Resorts<br>

	<p>This Statement was last updated on December 31, 2013, to describe how the privacy statement applies to all of the information we obtain from you and to update the privacy statement with respect to Westgate's Authorized Licensees, franchisees and certain other commercial partners set out below.</p>
    <h3>Browsing</h3>
    <p>This Web site does not collect personally identifiable information when you browse this Web site and request pages from our servers unless you provide it to us. This means that we will not know your name, your email address, or any other personally identifiable information just because you browse the Web site unless you:</p>
	<ul class="normal-list">
	   <li>access the Web site from a link in an email that we sent;</li>
	   <li>have input your personally identifiable information via your owner account management login;</li>
	   <li>are a Westgate Rewards member or have created a profile and you either log-in to your account or choose to be remembered via your cookie, including on your web-enabled mobile device; or </li>
	   <li>have input your personally identifiable information via a section of our Web site in which you are requesting to be contacted by Westgate.</li>
   	</ul>
    <p>In these cases we will know who you are based on the information you previously supplied to us. When you request a page from our Web site, our servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header including the IP number, the time of the request, the URL of your request and other information that is provided in the HTTP header. We collect the HTTP request header information in order to make our Web sites function correctly and provide you the functionality that you see on this Web site. We also use this information to personalize content presented to you, better understand how visitors use our Web site and how we can better tune it, its contents, and functionality to meet your needs.</p>
    <h3>Information We Collect and How it is Used</h3>
    <p>When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you to provide you with a particular service, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our properties, we will ask you for information such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, and room preference to process your reservation. We will use your email address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help in processing the reservation. We will also use your contact information to:</p>
	<ul class="normal-list">
	   <li>send you a non-marketing informational pre-arrival message summarizing your confirmation details and providing other information about the area and the hotel;</li>
	   <li>notify you about special offers and promotions as described in this privacy statement; as well as</li>
	   <li>send you periodic satisfaction or market research surveys.</li>
   	</ul>
    <p>You can opt out of marketing communications at any time. On occasion, we use third parties to provide us with additional contact information about you given the information you provided to us directly. For example, if we know your name and postal address, we may use a third party to provide us with your email address. We would then use this information for market analysis and marketing purposes.</p>
    <h3>Your California Privacy Policy</h3>

    <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>This Web site is not intended for children and we do not knowingly solicit or collect personally identifiable information from children. We may present information regarding Westgate programs that are for kids on this site for the reference of adults that are interested in activities at our locations for children.</p>
    <h3>Reservations</h3>
    <p>The personally identifiable information you provide to us for making a reservation is made available to the applicable property for the purpose of meeting your reservation request. After making a reservation or completing your stay at a Westgate property, unless you tell us otherwise, the information you provide may be used by us and our Authorized Licensees for marketing of Westgate properties and certain other Westgate branded products. Westgate may use the services of third-party mail houses for the sole purpose of mailing materials.</p>
	<p>After your stay we retain your personally identifiable information including details of your stay, room type and accommodation type.</p>
    <h3>Accessing our Web site from a Mobile Device</h3>
    <p>You can access our website from a web-enabled mobile device to find a property (including clicking to call the hotel) or view a reservation. If you desire to view a reservation you will be required to enter your Westgate account user name and password, or Westgate confirmation number and zip/postal code or country. No other personally identifiable information will be requested. In addition, you can make a reservation from a web-enabled device. When you make a reservation you will need to provide certain personally identifiable information such as name, email address and credit card information. Additionally, you can make payments to Westgate, via credit card, by accessing our website from a web-enabled mobile device.  To review the security measures Westgate has in place regarding your credit card data, please review the section below titled Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information ASAS.</p>
    <h3>Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information</h3>
    <p>We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. When we ask you for credit card data, it is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line, provided you are using a SSL enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox. We also use SSL on other pages where you would enter personally identifiable information. This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted from your computer or web-enabled device. You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock or key icon in the lower right-hand or left-hand corner of the computer screen appears in the locked position. In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."</p>
	<p>After information reaches us, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Westgate. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our properties or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the Web sites covered by this privacy statement is generally processed and stored in the United States.</p>
    <h3>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h3>
    <p>Westgate may use the services of third party processors, such as market researchers, fulfillment houses, email service providers and mail houses that process mail for Westgate, Westgate's Authorized Licensees, persons authorized by you, as well as such entities and marketing companies that provide these services for Westgate, and Westgate's Authorized Licensees. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose Westgate specifies. We may provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us.</p>
	<p>Westgate does not permit the sale or transfer of personally identifiable information to entities outside of the Westgate family of companies, and properties and our third party service providers for any non-Westgate use without your approval.</p>
 	<p>If you would like to request a list of our third party service providers, please send a letter to:</p>
