Personally identifiable information can be accessed and updated by the visitor during and after the registration process with the assistance of a Starwood customer service representative. Security is provided concerning credit card information, names, addresses, e-mail addresses and any other personal information that visitors may provide within the Reservation, Registered Online Customer and Preferred Guest portions of our websites. Although "guaranteed security" does not exist either on or off the Internet, we safeguard our visitors' personally identifiable information by using industry standard practices. Currently, our websites utilize a variety of different security measures designed to protect personally identifiable information from unauthorized access by users both inside and outside Starwood, including the use of 56-bit encryption based on a Class 3 Digital Certificate issued by Verisign Inc. This allows for utilization of Secure Sockets Layer, which is a method for encrypting data. This protects confidential information - such as credit card numbers, online forms, and financial data - from loss, misuse, interception and hacking. Third party websites that are accessed through links on our websites have separate privacy and data collection practices, and security measures. We have no responsibility or liability for the practices, policies and security measures implemented by third parties on their websites. We encourage you to contact them to ask questions about their privacy practices, policies and security measures before disclosing personal information. </p>

                            <p>Sometimes Starwood runs sweepstakes and contests. We ask people who participate to give us their contact information (like their email address). If a visitor participates in a sweepstakes or contest, his/her contact information may be used to reach him/her in connection with the sweepstakes or contest, and for other promotional, marketing and business purposes. </p>
                            <p>All Starwood sweepstakes/contests entry forms will provide a way for participants to opt-out of any communication from the sweepstake's/contest's manager that is not related to awarding prizes for the sweepstake/contest. Entry forms will further provide contestants with a choice whether to receive email marketing materials from our carefully selected third parties. When a visitor enters a Starwood sweepstakes/contest, the information the visitor provides is not shared with any third party, unless the visitor agrees to such by checking the opt-in box on the sweepstakes/contest entry form. By accepting the prize, the winner agrees that Starwood (and those acting under its authority) may use the winner's name, picture/portrait, likeness and/or voice for advertising and other promotional purposes without further consideration, unless prohibited by law.</p>

                            <p>From time to time Starwood may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will only be used for research and reporting purposes, to help Starwood to better serve its visitors by learning more about their needs. The survey responses may also be used to determine the effectiveness of our websites, various types of communications, advertising campaigns, and/or promotional activities. </p>
                            <p>If a visitor participates in a survey, the information given by the visitor will be used along with that of other study participants (for example, Starwood might report that 50% of a survey's respondents are women). Starwood may share anonymous individual and aggregate data for research and analysis purposes. </p>
                            <p>Starwood may also contact participants through e-mail for other purposes if given permission to do so. For example, if participants indicate in the survey that they wish to join a Starwood online research panel. When a participant submits a survey, the e-mail address and the response to the "future contact" question described above, are automatically stored in a database that is intentionally separated from the participant's survey responses. Therefore, the participant's e-mail address is not tied back to the survey responses. Starwood will not share with third parties the personally identifiable information provided by a survey participant in response to survey questions. For all other purposes, only aggregate data that is devoid of all personally identifiable information will be used. </p>
                            <p>In the course of providing surveys to visitors, a cookie may be placed on their browser in order to control the research process, primarily to stop people from being asked to take the same survey twice - or being allowed to take the same survey twice. In addition, the types of advertising visitors view in emails received or on websites during the course of their web surfing, may be connected to the visitor's anonymous survey responses. </p>
                            <p>Participation in Starwood's surveys is voluntary. Participants who do not wish to receive email communications from Starwood may opt out of the receipt of such communication by notifying us as provided below. </p>
