	We respect our visitors’ privacy.  Personally identifiable information can be accessed and updated by the visitor during and after the registration process with the assistance of a Starwood customer service representative. Security is provided concerning credit card information, names, addresses, e-mail addresses and any other personal information that visitors may provide within the Reservation, Registered Online Customer and Preferred Guest portions of our websites. Although “guaranteed security” does not exist either on or off the Internet, we safeguard our visitors’ personally identifiable information by using industry standard practices.  Currently, our websites utilize a variety of different security measures designed to protect personally identifiable information from unauthorized access by users both inside and outside Starwood, including the use of 56-bit encryption based on a Class 3 Digital Certificate issued by Verisign Inc. This allows for utilization of Secure Sockets Layer, which is a method for encrypting data. This protects confidential information - such as credit card numbers, online forms, and financial data - from loss, misuse, interception and hacking. Third party websites that are accessed through links on our websites have separate privacy and data collection practices, and security measures. We have no responsibility or liability for the practices, policies and security measures implemented by third parties on their websites. We encourage you to contact them to ask questions about their privacy practices, policies and security measures before disclosing personal information.

It is essentially the visitor’s identification card when s/he returns to the Starwood website.  Cookies save visitors time because they help us to provide the visitor a customized experience without having to remind us of his/her preferences each time s/he returns to our web pages.  Starwood cookies cannot damage visitor files, nor can they read information from the visitor’s hard drive.  
	
	<br><br>
	
	Cookies help us provide our visitors with a personalized online experience in the following ways:
	<ul>
	  <li>They remember visitor names and passwords for future visits so log-in is easier and faster

	</li></ul>
	
	Starwood cookies do not follow visitors when traveling on the Internet after leaving Starwood websites. We track the usage of our websites in order to modify it according to our visitors' needs.

	<br><br>Within the reservation process, the Registered Online Customer process and on the Starwood Preferred Guest website, we provide a profile section.  Filling in this information makes it easier for visitors to conduct certain transactions, including making hotel reservations online. We respect our visitors’ privacy and maintain their profile information on a secure server.  Personally identifiable information can be accessed and updated by the visitor with the assistance of a Starwood customer service representative. Starwood will not  use our visitor’s confidential information for purposes which are not disclosed to or authorized by the visitor.  Visitors have the opportunity to review the information they provide and update it at any time. 
	<br><br>Occasionally, information that a visitor requests to be removed will be retained in certain files in order to properly resolve disputes or to troubleshoot problems.  In addition, information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including stored “back up” systems.  Therefore, visitors should not expect that all of their personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in response to their requests. 
	<br><br>Data collected by Starwood is an asset.  It is possible that Starwood, its subsidiaries, affiliates, joint venture companies, or any combination of the foregoing, could merge with or be acquired by another legal entity.  In such event, visitors should expect that Starwood may share some or all of the data collected from its visitors with such other entity; provided, that such other entity will be notified of the practices which apply to personally identifiable information under Starwood’s applicable privacy policy.
	<br><br>Questions or comments about Starwood or about our privacy policy should be directed as follows:

	<br><br><b>SWEEPSTAKES / CONTESTS:</b> 
	
	<br><br>Sometimes Starwood runs sweepstakes and contests. We ask people who participate to give us their contact information (like their email address). If a visitor participates in a sweepstakes or contest, his/her contact information may be used to reach him/her in connection with the sweepstakes or contest, and for other promotional, marketing and business purposes. 
	<br><br>All Starwood sweepstakes/contests entry forms will provide a way for participants to opt-out of any communication from the sweepstake’s/contest’s manager that is not related to awarding prizes for the sweepstake/contest. Entry forms will further provide contestants with a choice whether to receive email marketing materials from our carefully selected third parties. When a visitor enters a Starwood sweepstakes/contest, the information the visitor provides is not shared with any third party, unless the visitor agrees to such by checking the opt-in box on the sweepstakes/contest entry form. By accepting the prize, the winner agrees that Starwood (and those acting under its authority) may use the winner’s name, picture/portrait, likeness and/or voice for advertising and other promotional purposes without further consideration, unless prohibited by law.

	<br><br><a name="link7"><b>RESEARCH:</b> </a>
	<br><br>From time to time Starwood may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will only be used for research and reporting purposes, to help Starwood to better serve its visitors by learning more about their needs.  The survey responses may also be used to determine the effectiveness of our websites, various types of communications, advertising campaigns, and/or promotional activities. 
	<br><br>If a visitor participates in a survey, the information given by the visitor will be used along with that of other study participants (for example, Starwood might report that 50% of a survey's respondents are women). Starwood may share anonymous individual and aggregate data for research and analysis purposes.  
	<br><br>Starwood may also contact participants through e-mail for other purposes if given permission to do so. For example, if participants indicate in the survey that they wish to join a Starwood online research panel. When a participant submits a survey, the e-mail address and the response to the “future contact” question described above, are automatically stored in a database that is intentionally separated from the participant’s survey responses. Therefore, the participant’s e-mail address is not tied back to the survey responses. Starwood will not share with third parties the personally identifiable information provided by a survey participant in response to survey questions.  For all other purposes, only aggregate data that is devoid of all personally identifiable information will be used.  
	<br><br>In the course of providing surveys to visitors, a cookie may be placed on their browser in order to control the research process, primarily to stop people from being asked to take the same survey twice – or being allowed to take the same survey twice. In addition, the types of advertising visitors view in emails received or on websites during the course of their web surfing, may be connected to the visitor’s anonymous survey responses. 
	<br><br>Participation in Starwood’s surveys is voluntary.  Participants who do not wish to receive email communications from Starwood may opt out of the receipt of such communication by notifying us as provided below.
