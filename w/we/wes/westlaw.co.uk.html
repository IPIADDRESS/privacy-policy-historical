<h3>SWEET &amp; MAXWELL PRIVACY STATEMENT</h3>

<ol id="privacyPolicy">
<li>This website is published by Thomson Reuters (Legal) Limited (Company No. 1679046. Registered in
England &amp; Wales. Registered Office and address for service: 100 Avenue Road, London NW3 3PF), which
trades using various trading names, of which a list is posted on its website at <a href="http://www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/About/Index.aspx" title="link to About Sweet and Maxwell">www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/about/index.aspx</a>, and is part of Thomson Reuters.</li>

<li>Thomson Reuters (Legal) Limited ('the Company') is committed to respecting your privacy and we
recognise your need to know that your personal information is being lawfully processed and held in
accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. The Company is a registered data controller under number
Z7602050.</li>

<li>This Privacy Statement has been created in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998 data protection
principles and is designed to help you understand how we may use and safeguard the personal information you
provide to us via any of the Company's websites.</li>

<li>Company websites may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of
such other sites. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by us via Company
websites. This Privacy Statement also applies to any information you may provide directly to our customer
service teams. That information may include any personal contact information and other information we may
need to provide assistance and information to you.</li>

<li>In general you may browse Company websites (other than those provided on a subscription basis) without
providing any personal information. The information we collect on an aggregate basis, as you and others
browse Company websites, is not used to identify you in any way. If you want to interact with us via a
Company website or if you wish to register to use certain parts of a Company website, we may ask you to
provide us with some personal information.</li>

<li>You may be asked to provide us with details about yourself so that we can provide you with information
or services you have requested or send you information about our products and services. The details we ask
for may vary with the services you request. The relevant online entry page will give you more information
about how we might use and share those details.</li>

<li>Where we offer you the ability (and you wish) to purchase our products or services through a Company
website, you may need to provide us with information so that we can complete the transaction (including
your credit card details).</li>

<li>Cookies
 <p>In common with most professional online services, we may use cookies to speed up navigation through
 Company websites. A cookie is a piece of encoded information that is sent from the website and stored in
 your computer's memory. This piece of information identifies who you are and therefore avoids the
 time-consuming process of checking your details against our user database each time a new page is
 requested. A few points on cookies:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>cookies only contain as much information as was disclosed to the site that sent it</li>
  <li>cookies do not take information from your hard drive, delete files or contain viruses</li>
  <li>cookies are small files (100s of bytes) and do not pose a disk space problem</li>
  <li>the information in each cookie cannot be readily decoded or used in any other way</li>
  <li>if you choose you can usually change your web browser to disable storage of cookies.</li>
 </ul>
</li>

<li>Information Use<br>
 <p>Information<br>

 <ul>
  <li>process, validate and verify subscriptions and purchase orders</li>
  <li>contact the user when necessary</li>
  <li>send email notifications of new site features, newsletters and topic updates</li>
  <li>potentially tailor the user's experience on visiting the site by varying the content based upon known
  demographics and profiles</li>
  <li>monitor users' visits and generally collate aggregate site traffic information. Unless you agree
  otherwise, the information you provide to us will only be used to provide you with the products or
  services you have requested. However, we and other Thomson Reuters companies would like to use the
  details you give us via Company websites to provide you with additional information about our products
  and services. You will be asked to confirm your agreement to this when you enter your details.</li>

 third parties for marketing purposes under any circumstances.</p>
 <p>Opt outs<br>
 You may opt out of receiving information or advertisements from us or other Thomson Reuters companies
 to which we have passed your details by contacting Customer Services (details below).</p>
 <p>Some Company websites allow the user to opt-out of future mailings during the registration process or
 select 'web only' notification S9ome Company websites allow the user to edit/update their own personal
 details and opt-in or out of receiving product or service information in the future.</p>
 <p>Disposals and business reorganisation<br>
 Except when disposing of a particular publication, we do not rent, sell, share or trade any of your
 personal information on our e mail lists to any third parties outside of Thomson Reuters without your
