  <p><b>Privacy Statement</b></p>
  <p>Effective 02/10/2011</p>
  <p>WeShop, Inc.<br>
  32 E 31st Street<br>
  12th Floor<br>
  New York, NY 10016<br>
  Phone: 1-(888)-weshop1</p>
  <p><b>Privacy</b></p>
  <p>We NEVER reveal any
  personally identifiable information about you. Your information is just that – yours! WeShop keeps your information
  completely secure. We don't reveal it to anyone without your permission. </p>
  <p>This privacy statement
  describes how WeShop collects and uses the personal information you provide on
  our Web site: <a href="http://www.weshop.com">http://www.weshop.com</a>. It also describes the choices available
  to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access
  and update this information.</p>
  <p>WeShop has been awarded TRUSTe's
  Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been
  reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with 
  <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html">TRUSTe's program
  requirements</a> including transparency,
  accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal
  information. TRUSTe's mission, as
  an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and
  organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative
  trust solutions. If you have
  questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please
  contact us at <a href="mailto:info@weshop.com">info@weshop.com</a> or you can
  contact <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint">TRUSTe
  here</a>. The TRUSTe
  program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and
  does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded
  from the site.</p>
  <p><b>Transparency</b></p>
  <p>Whatever shopping data
  WeShop collects from you, you'll see.
  Anytime WeShop collects shopping data from you, you'll see it when you
  log in to your account. Shopping-based
  data is the only data WeShop's systems collect from a connected email
  address. That's it.</p>
  <p><b>Authority</b></p>
  <p>WeShop gives you the tools
  to take control of your purchasing information, and benefit from it! Details about the things you buy
  – clothes, food, music, tickets – are valuable to merchants and
  marketers to make you offers.
  WeShop believes this information is YOURS and yours alone. You should control it and how it is
  used. Access to your information should
  be on your terms and you should benefit by getting great offers in return for
  the things you want at the prices you want to pay. In addition, you should be able to share information about
  your purchases with other consumers, so you can find out where they bought the
  things you want and what they paid for them. In this way consumers can learn
  from each other where the great deals are, and what products and services are
  in demand, without constantly being pitched by merchants.</p>
  <p><b>Our Privacy Policy</b></p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes the manner in which WeShop,
  Inc., which operates the www.weshop.com site, uses and
  protects the information which you either send us as a result of ads,
  promotions, or communications, or which you allow us to learn as a result of
  your use of the WeShop site. We
  may update this privacy statement to reflect changes in our information
  practices. If we make any material
  changes we will notify you by email (sent to
  the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this
  Site prior to the changes becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the
  latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
  <p>Our aim is to adhere to the
  highest standards of online privacy, and to safeguard your information at all
  times. <b>We will never share any personally identifiable information about you
  with any person without your consent.</b></p>
  <p>By using the WeShop Sites
  you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy, and also to our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use.</a> Please note that this Privacy Policy does not cover
  the use and collection of information on any non WeShop Site, including any
  site linked to or accessible through any of the WeShop Sites.</p>
  <p>We collect information from
  you in three ways: (1) When you register with WeShop you provide us with your e
  mail address and password. Following registration, you then send us, or we
  acquire with your permission through certain technological interventions,
  various details on your shopping and purchasing transactions. If you choose to purchase a
  product from the site we will collect information
  such as name, address, and credit card information.;
  (2) When you visit the WeShop Sites, we automatically collect information such
  as your IP address, domain name, the type of browser you used, which site you
  came to us from, how long you spent on our site, and what pages you viewed; and
  (3) When you contact us directly, we collect any information you chose to share
  with us as part of such communication. </p>
  <p>We strive to give you as
  much control as possible over the way information is collected and used: (1) We
  use cookies which reside on your computer's hard drive to recognize
  automatically when you visit the WeShop Sites, and make your experience faster
  and more productive. You can set
  your browser not to accept such cookies, or you can delete the cookies that
  from time to time reside on your hard drive. However, deleting our cookies may substantially restrict the
  manner in which you can view or use the WeShop Sites, and your use of any
  WeShop services; and (2) Similarly, some of our advertisers, marketing partners
  and consultants (Òthird partiesÓ) may also use cookies for similar purposes
  which you may obtain from any of the WeShop Sites. We do not control or receive any information from such third
  party cookies, but we do record when you respond to third party messages
  carried on the WeShop Sites, and in certain cases through Òweb beaconÓ
  technology also record any further action (e.g. such as making a purchase) you
  take as a result of such third party messages. We also may use web beacon technology to inform us when you
  open an email communication from us. </p>
  <p><b>Links to Other Web Sites</b></p>
  <p>Our Site includes links to
  other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of WeShop,
  Inc. If you submit personal
  information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their
  privacy statements. We encourage
  you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.</p>
  <p><b>Agents/Service Providers</b></p>
  <p>We will provide your
  personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our
  business activities such as billing and shipping. These companies are authorized to use your personal
  information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>

  <p>In the event you compliment
  our services in a communication to us, we might use this testimonial on our
  site by quoting your compliment and attributing the testimonial to you (first

  testimonial removed by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@weshop.com">support@weshop.com</a>.</p>
  <p><b>Security</b></p>
  <p>The security of your
  personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry
  standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
  transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet,
  or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot
  guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on
  our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@weshop.com">support@weshop.com</a>.</p>
  <p><b>Accessing and Correcting Person</b></p>

  ask that you contact us at <a href="mailto:support@weshop.com">support@weshop.com</a> to change 
  the email address associated with your account.</p>
  <p><b>Choice/Opt-Out</b></p>

  account with us we will send you a daily email offer which you

  may choose to stop receiving your daily email offer, newsletter or
  marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in the
  emails you receive.</p>

  <p>We will retain your information for as long as your

  <p><b>Tell-A-Friend</b></p>
  <p>If you choose to use our
  referral service to refer a friend, send to a friend, email a page, or invite a
  friend to our site, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend
  a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. WeShop stores this information for the
  sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our
  referral program.</p>
  <p><b>Facebook Connect</b></p>
  <p>You can log in to our site using Facebook Connect. These
  services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share
  certain personal information with us such as

  the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your
  profile page to share with others within your network.</p>

  <p>We reserve the right to
  disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when
  we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply
  with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web
  site.</p>
  <p><b>Business Transactions</b></p>
  <p>In the event WeShop, Inc.
  goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another
