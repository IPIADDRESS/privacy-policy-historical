            <h4>WeShop operates by these important Principles.</h4>
			<br>

			<h5>Privacy</h5>
			We NEVER reveal any personally identifiable information about you.
			Your information is just that – yours!&nbsp; WeShop keeps your information completely secure.&nbsp; We don’t reveal it to anyone without your permission. Plus, you can leave the WeShop community and delete your information at any time.
			<br>
			<br>

			<h5>Transparency</h5>
			Whatever shopping data WeShop collects from you, you'll see.
			Anytime WeShop collects shopping data from you, you'll see it in your purchase stream.  Shopping-based data is the only data WeShop's systems collect from a connected email address.  That's it.
			<br>
			<br>

			<h5>Authority</h5>
			WeShop gives you the tools to take control of your purchasing information, and benefit from it!
			Details about the things you buy – clothes, food, music, tickets – are valuable to merchants and marketers to make you offers.&nbsp; WeShop believes this information is YOURS and yours alone.&nbsp; You should control it and how it is used.&nbsp; Access to your information should be on your terms and you should benefit by getting great offers in return for the things you want at the prices you want to pay.&nbsp; In addition, you should be able to share information about your purchases with other consumers, so you can find out where they bought the things you want and what they paid for them.&nbsp; In this way consumers can learn from each other where the great deals are, and what products and services are in demand, without constantly being pitched by merchants.
			<br>
			<br>

			<h4>Our Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes the manner in which WeShop, Inc., which operates the www.weshop.com site and various other sites and services related to the WeShop Consumer Network (the “WeShop Sites”), uses and protects the information which you either send us as a result of ads, promotions, contests, sweepstakes or other communications, or which you allow us to learn as a result of your use of the WeShop Sites. We may change the terms of this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will announce such changes on the WeShop Sites so our visitors and members can learn of such changes and decide whether or not to continue to visit our sites and use our services.</p>

			<p>Our aim is to adhere to the highest standards of online privacy, and to safeguard your information at all times. <b>We will never share any personally identifiable information about you with any person without your consent, unless required by law to do so*.</b></p>
			
			<p>By using the WeShop Sites you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy, and also to our <a href="/terms/">Terms of Use.</a> Please note that this Privacy Policy does not cover the use and collection of information on any non WeShop Site, including any site linked to or accessible through any of the WeShop Sites.</p>
			
			<p>We collect information from you in three ways: (1) When you register with WeShop you provide us with your e mail address and, if requested, your name and password. Following registration, you then send us, or we acquire with your permission through certain technological interventions, various details on your shopping and purchasing transactions; (2) When you visit the WeShop Sites, we automatically collect information such as your IP address, domain name, the type of browser you used, which site you came to us from, how long you spent on our site, and what pages you viewed; and (3) When you contact us directly, we collect any information you chose to share with us as part of such communication. In the event you compliment our services in a communication to us, we might use this testimonial on our site by quoting your compliment and attributing the testimonial to you (first name only plus the initial capital letter of your last name). <b>We strive to maintain the highest standards in data handling, storage and security practices to ensure that your data remains at all times private and confidential.</b> In the event you are a winner of a sweepstakes or contest we are running, we might also publicize your winning on the WeShop Sites according to the rules of the applicable contest or sweepstakes.</p>

			<p>We use the information collected as described above in the following ways: (1) to enter you into any applicable contest or sweepstake you are seeking to enter; (2) to populate your personal shopping dashboard with information about your purchasing transactions that you have sent to us or allowed us to collect; (3) with your permission, to send you marketing messages; (4) with your permission, to send you e mails; (5) to display specific messages and content on our site which may be of interest to you; (6) to send to others you have designated to receive such information (e.g. friends and family; you can change these personal privacy settings to add or delete those with whom you want to share information at any time); (7) to provide you services that you have requested which are related to such information, such as reminders and updates; and (8) only as regards aggregated, non-personally identifiable information, to share with advertisers and other commercial partners.</p>
			
			<p><b>We strive to give you as much control as possible over the way information is collected and used:</b> (1) We use cookies which reside on your computer’s hard drive to recognize you automatically when you visit the WeShop Sites, and make your experience faster and more productive. You can set your browser not to accept such cookies, or you can delete the cookies that from time to time reside on your hard drive. However, deleting our cookies may substantially restrict the manner in which you can view or use the WeShop Sites, and your use of any WeShop services; and (2) Similarly, some of our advertisers, marketing partners and consultants (“third parties”) may also use cookies for similar purposes which you may obtain from any of the WeShop Sites. We do not control or receive any information from such third party cookies, but we do record when you respond to third party messages carried on the WeShop Sites, and in certain cases through “web beacon” technology also record any further action (e.g. such as making a purchase) you take as a result of such third party messages. We also may use web beacon technology to inform us when you open an e mail communication from us.</p>
			
			<p>* There may be cases where we need to share personal information in the event of suspected illegal activity. Also, other situations may arise from the operation of our business where such information can be shared with other parties (for example, in the event our company is sold to another party) who are under strict non disclosure agreements restricting their use of such data.</p>
