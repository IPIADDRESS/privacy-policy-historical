  <p>We-Care.com  knows that you care about how  information about you is handled. We value  your trust and are committed to using private data respectfully and  transparently.</p>
<p>We-Care.comis wholly owned by Internet Marketing  Group, Ltd. Any provisions of this policy that apply to We-Care.com also apply  to Internet Marketing Group, Ltd. For the purposes of this policy,  "we" refers to We-Care.com and the "Site" refers to any of  We-Care.com's websites, the Shop &amp; Give Gadget, and the Badges available from our Downloads page.</p>
  <p>We-Care.com  collects limited amounts of personal information. This information allows us to  provide you with an optimal experience on our Site and ensures that donations  are properly credited and promptly paid. If you choose to participate in our  optional registration, information we collect also allows us to store your  preferences, contact you by email, and provide you with a record of your  donations. </p>
  <p>Though  some We-Care.com sites are co-branded with nonprofits, schools, and  associations, the sites are owned and operated by We-Care.com. Any information  collected is owned by We-Care.com and is not shared with co-branding partners  except as noted below.</p>
  <p>We-Care.com  does not sell your private information. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 class="FAQ">INFORMATION WE COLLECT FOR INDIVIDUALS</h1>
    <p>We-Care.com allows our  visitors the option of registering, allowing them to take advantage of enhanced  features. Registration is completely optional. The amount of information we  collect depends on whether or not you decide to register.</p>
  <p>As is true of most websites,  we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files,  regardless of whether or not you register. This information includes internet  protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),  referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and what pages  visitors use and what order they use them in. We use this information, which  does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site,  to track users' movements around the site, and to gather demographic  information about our user base as a whole.</p>
  <p>If you choose to register, we  also collect information you provide us, such as your name, email address,  country, and postal code. We use this information for the following reasons:</p>
   <ul class="bullet">
    <li><b>To       provide you with a record of your donations. </b>Registered users can view their account at       anytime to see a list of their transactions and how much they've donated. <b></b></li>
    <li><b>To set       site preferences. </b>We are       continually enhancing our site to provide users with a more customized       experience. Your account contains a record of your site preferences —       including the organization to which you are donating — so that you do not       need to reset them on each visit or when you access the Site from       different computers.<b></b></li>
    <li><b>To       provide you with information. </b>We       send out periodic emails to announce changes in our services or alert you       to special deals. (See Emails below.)<b></b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>We also store other  information you provide us, such as email inquiries sent to us. That  information is only used for purposes for which it is provided.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 class="FAQ">INFORMATION WE COLLECT FOR CAUSES</h1>
    <p>We-Care.com allows visitors  to donate a portion of their purchases from participating merchants to the  nonprofit, school, or association (collectively known as "Causes") of their  choice. </p>
  <p>Causes may be submitted by  representatives from the organization or by supporters. (Please note that when  a Cause is added by a supporter, We-Care.com does not have a formal  relationship with the organization. When a representative from the Cause  applies for inclusion in We-Care.com, they are entering into a formal  relationship with We-Care.com that allows for co-branding and co-promotions.  Please see our <a href="http://www.we-care.com/TOS">Terms of Service</a> for more  details on these relationships.)</p>
   <ul class="bullet">
    <li>When a Cause is submitted by a supporter, we       require a name and email address from that person so we can contact them       if there are any questions about the Cause they are submitting and to       alert them once their Cause has been successfully added to We-Care.com.</li>
    <li>When a Cause is submitted by an official       representative of the organization, we require their name and email       address, along with the following organizational information: phone       number, mailing address, type of organization (selected from a drop-down       menu), tax ID, and URL (if available). This information allows us to work       with the Cause in order to set up their We-Care.com site and to provide       payments to the Cause when money accrues.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 class="FAQ">EMAILS</h1>
    <p>If you are registered, we will occasionally send you information on special offers — generally deals that can save you money or provide a particularly high donation to your cause. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications through an opt-out link at the bottom of each HTML email. If we send a text email, where this link is not possible, we will instruct you to reply with the words "opt out" in the subject if you no longer wish to receive these offers. At any time, you can change your email preferences by visiting the My Account section of the site.</p>
    
<p>If you are registered, we  will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it  is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended  for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt out of  these communications, which are not promotional in nature, as they are  necessary for using the site. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 class="FAQ">COOKIES, WEB BEACONS, AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
<p>We-Care.com uses cookies to provide you with a more customized experience and ensure that your donations are credited to the intended organizations. </p>
  <p>Cookies are small pieces of information stored by your browser. Only We-Care.com can access cookies we set. Though they do <i>not</i> contain any personally identifiable information (e.g., your name or email address), they do contain a unique user ID and IDs for the causes you have supported through We-Care.com. If you choose to register, the user ID is also linked to your account, allowing you to track your donations.</p>
<p>We also employ a technology called clear web beacons (also known as clear pixels and clear gifs). Web beacons do <i>not</i> contain or collect personally identifiable information, but do have a unique identifier that tracks online movements. These are used for two purposes: 1) To help learn how visitors are using the Site so that we can improve the Site. 2) Let merchants know when and how often their coupons and offers are displayed.</p>
<p>We may also use  these technologies in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. </p>
  <p>If you are registered with our site, we may tie the information gathered through these technologies to your account to help us provide a better user experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 class="FAQ">INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES</h1>
    We never sell personally  identifiable information. <p></p>
  <p>We don't share personally  identifiable information with third parties except under the following  conditions:</p>
   <ul class="bullet">
    <li>We-Care.com may share personally identifiable       information with third parties that perform functions on our behalf.       Examples include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing       assistance, and providing customer service. They have access to this data       only to perform their operational or other support functions and may not use       it for other purposes.</li>
    <li>Registered members can request that their       information is shared with the Causes they support through We-Care.com.       Choosing to do this allows your Cause to build a more personal       relationship with you and keep you up to date with its work. This is       optional and you can choose whether or not we share your information when       you register with We-Care.com. You can change this option at any time, but       any information shared with organizations you support cannot be withdrawn       after it has been submitted. </li>
    <li>We-Care.com may provide information to regulatory       authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable       law or when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it.</li>
    <li>In the event of a sale of all or part of our       businesses, we may transfer user information related to that business to       the new owner as part of the transaction.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We-Care.com may use, share,  and publish aggregated data in forms that do not include personally  identifiable information. This data may be used for improving our services,  helping the organizations we work with better serve their supporters, and  marketing purposes.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 class="FAQ">THIRD-PARTY COOKIES, WEB BEACONS, SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES, AND PRIVACY POLICIES</h1>
    Our Privacy Policy only  applies to information gathered by We-Care.com.<p></p>
  <p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers, affiliate networks, and analytics services) also serve cookies, web beacons (also known as clear pixels and clear gifs) and similar technologies on the Site. All third-party data collected using these tracking technologies is anonymous and is not linked to your account. This anonymous data may be used to provide us with statistical information on site usage, customize advertisements that consumers see on participating websites, and analyze whether advertising resulted in sales, clicks, or other activity. These business partners include <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="window.open('http://www.google.com');return false;">Google</a>, <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="window.open('http://www.linkshare.com');return false;">Linkshare</a>, <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="window.open('http://www.cj.com');return false;">Commission Junction</a>, <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="window.open('http://www.gigya.com');return false;">Gigya</a>, and <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="window.open('http://www.didit.com');return false;">Didit</a>. To learn more about how they handle this anonymous data, please check their privacy policies. We-Care.com, our merchant partners, and our ad networks may use additional service providers not listed above.</p>
<p>When you leave the Site to  visit one of our merchants, you are leaving We-Care.com and visiting the  merchant's website. They may use cookies on their site for purposes that  include identifying you as a visitor from We-Care.com in order to pay the  commission on your purchase. (These commissions are the source of all donations  we make on your behalf.) Many merchants also use a third-party "affiliate  network" to do this on their behalf. We do not provide any personally  identifiable information to the merchant or their affiliate network. Any  information you provide to them is governed by their privacy policies.</p>
  <p>The Site also contains links  to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us — most commonly links  to Causes. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or  privacy practices of such websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave  our Site and to read the privacy statements of every website that collects  personally identifiable information.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 class="FAQ">SECURITY</h1>
    <p>The security of your personal  information is important to us. We collect only a minimal amount of personally  identifiable information, and we work hard to protect it. <!-- When you enter  personal information (such as an email address or password) on our forms, we  encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).--></p>
  <p>We follow generally accepted  industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both  during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the  internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Though we use  commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we shall  not be responsible for any actual or consequential damages that result from a  lapse in compliance with this Privacy Policy as a result of a security breach  or technical malfunction.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 class="FAQ">CHANGES IN THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</h1>
    We reserve the right to  modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If  we make material changes to this policy, we may also notify you by email or by  means of a notice on our homepage.<p></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    If you have questions or  suggestions about our privacy policy or wish to correct, change, or verify any  personal information we have about you, please <a href="/About/ContactUs?subject=Privacy+Policy">contact  us</a>.			<p></p>
