<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
	<br>
	Date of Last Revision: 3/3/2006<br>
	<br>

<a name="privacy"></a>
<p>At Wetpaint, we are committed to ensuring the privacy of our users.
This privacy policy explains Wetpaint's privacy practices for this Web site ("Site"), <a href="http://www.wetpaint.com">http://www.wetpaint.com</a>,
and any Wetpaint based Web site ("Sites"), for users of our
services. By using the Site, you consent to the terms of this
privacy policy.</p>

<a name="whatis_personalinfo"></a>
<h2>What is Personal Information?</h2>
<p>Personal information is information that specifically identifies an
individual, such as a user name, address, telephone number, e-mail
address, credit card or other account number, and information about that
individual’s activities when directly linked to that person.
Personal information also includes demographic information such as date
of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information
is linked to other personal information that identifies you.</p>

<a name="collected_personalinfo"></a>
<h2>Personal Information We Collect</h2>
<p>You may provide personal information to us in a number of ways when
you visit. For example, depending on the specific web site,
you may provide us with personal information when you:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Register as a member and set up an account;</li>
	<li>Subscribe to email notification of certain changes in Site
	functionality or content (e.g., page changes); or</li>
	<li>Contact us by email for any reason (such as to request customer
	service or provide us with your comments/feedback). We collect your
	name and email address in this manner.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that we are not responsible for any personal information
that you voluntarily provide as part of any edits or similar submissions
to the Sites and we discourage you from doing so, as such information is
publicly available.</p>
<p>When you visit our Sites, some information is also automatically
collected, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your
computer's operating system, the browser type, the address of a
referring web site, and the time and date of your visit and Site pages
visited. This information is collected through the use of "cookies."
Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by a web site
to give you a unique identification. We use cookies on our Sites to help
optimize your online experience. For example, we use cookies to track
your editing of, and submissions to, our Sites. We treat this
information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to
any of the personally identifying information mentioned above.
Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.</p>
<p>Wetpaint does not require that you accept cookies, however, some
functionality on our Sites may be disabled if you decline to accept
cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a
cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.</p>

<a name="using_personalinfo"></a>
<h2>How We Use Personal Information</h2>
<p>In general, we may use personal information to process your requests
or transactions and provide you with high-quality services or to inform
you about other products or services we think will be of interest. For
example, we use your information to provide online editing and
publishing services to you, and to display customized content and
advertising. We may also use personal information for certain auditing,
research and analysis to operate and improve Wetpaint technologies and
services. Your personal information may also be used to set up or
contact you regarding your account. When we use your personal
information, it may be processed on our services in the United States of
America and in other countries, and your information may be processed
on a server that lies outside your own country.</p>
<p>When we use personal information in our internal marketing efforts,
we provide you with choices (see Choice below) and do not disclose the
information to third parties except as described in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>We may receive information from third parties with whom we have
business relationships, and will combine this information with the other
personal information we maintain about you. In such cases, this privacy
policy governs this information.</p>

<a name="aggregateinfo"></a>
<h2>Use of Aggregate Information</h2>
<p>Personal information does not include “aggregate”
information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or
category of services or users, from which individual identities have
been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service
may be collected and combined with information about how others use the
same service, but no personal information will be included in the
resulting data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer
needs so that we can better consider new services and tailor existing
services to customer desires. We may share aggregated non-personal
information with third parties outside of Wetpaint.</p>

<a name="sharing_personalinfo"></a>
<h2>Sharing of Personal Information</h2>
<p>We do not sell, rent or share personal information with third parties
without your prior consent except in the limited circumstances described
in this privacy policy. We share personal information with third-party
vendors and contractors who assist us in performing internal functions
necessary to operate our business. These functions may include, for
example, analyzing data and providing marketing assistance. We require
our third party vendors to only use the information for the purpose it
was provided. We are not responsible for any additional information you
provide directly to third parties, and we encourage you to become
familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to
them.</p>
<p>We also reserve the right to disclose personal information when we
believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful
subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this privacy
policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill,
and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users' rights,
property or safety; to prevent or protect our users from fraudulent,
abusive, or unlawful use of our Sites; to ensure the security of our
network and services; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency
involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any
person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of
records without delay.</p>
<p>In addition, information about our users, including personally
identifiable information, may be disclosed as part of any merger,
acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the
event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally
identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of
the business assets of the company.</p>

<a name="external_links"></a>
<h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>
<p>Our Sites contain links to other web sites. Any personal information
you provide on the linked pages is provided directly to that third party
and is subject to that third party’s privacy policy. Except as described
above, we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security
practices and policies of web sites to which we link. Links from Sites
to third parties or to other sites are provided for your convenience. We
encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and
policies before providing them with personal information.</p>

<a name="children"></a>
<h2>Use of the Sites by Children</h2>
<p>We encourage parents to take an active interest in their children's
use of the Internet. We do not intend to collect information from
children who are under 13 years of age. If you are under 13, you will
not be allowed to register for our service and you should not provide
information on our Sites.</p>

<a name="security"></a>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We have put into place reasonable security measures in an effort to
protect personal information while it is under our control. For example,
your account information is accessible online only through the use of a
password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information on such
sites, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to
any other person. You are responsible for all uses of our Sites by any
person using your password. Please <a href="contact.html">contact
us</a> immediately if you believe your password has been misused.</p>

<a name="choice"></a>
<h2>Choice</h2>
<p>To opt-out of receiving communications from us or to request that we
correct or delete your personal information, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>, or edit your online profile
settings on this website.</p>

<a name="policy_changes"></a>
<h2>Policy Changes</h2>
<p>We will modify this privacy policy from time to time as our privacy
practices keep up to date with technology and legal developments. We will
notify you of the changes by posting the new policy on our Sites and
indicating at the top of the privacy policy the date it was last
updated. We encourage you to review our privacy policy each time you
visit our Sites to see if it has been updated since your last visit and
to make sure you understand how the information that you provide will be used.</p>

<a name="comments"></a>
<h2>Your Comments or Concerns</h2>
<p>We welcome your feedback. If you have any comments or concerns about
this privacy policy, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>
