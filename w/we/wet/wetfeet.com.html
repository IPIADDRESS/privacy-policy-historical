WetFeet, Inc., Privacy Statement
</b></font><br>

<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1&quot;" class="text">

<!-- Start Copy -->

WetFeet, Inc., a Universum company, has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our strong commitment to privacy. The following statement explains our information gathering and dissemination practices for our site on the World Wide Web at <a href="http://www.wetfeet.com">www.wetfeet.com</a> (the "Site"). This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. <p>

<b>Your Privacy</b><br>
When we gather information from insiders for Insider Guides and other career research products, we work hard to provide them anonymity. They are understandably concerned about their privacy, and we go to great lengths to ensure that their identity is never released by WetFeet, Inc., to anyone outside of WetFeet. </p><p>

WetFeet, Inc., values your privacy too. We only request information absolutely essential to the filling of your order or to understand you better so that we can improve our products and services. We will not release name or contact information to third parties without your consent, unless, of course, you're submitting your identity for a purchase from our Site with a credit card. In that case, we will share necessary billing information information with our credit car processor and shipping information with the shipper you designate. Billing information is sent from WetFeet to our credit card processor, CyberCash. We do not store your payment information on our site; it resides on the secure servers of CyberCash indefinitely.</p><p>

However, we may comply with any subpoena, order of court, or request by a regulatory or law enforcement agency to gain access to any of the information that we collect.</p><p>

<b>Cookies</b><br>
At times, we use a feature of your Web browser to send your computer a "cookie," a small data file that's stored on your hard drive. We do not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information from your computer. We use cookies to enhance your experience on our Site and to give you better, more personalized service once you've purchased or registered. Cookies allow us to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site. We use this information for internal use only; we don't share it with others. If you chose to refuse to accept cookies, you will be unable to purchase Insider Guides or access member-only areas, and you may experience other loss in site functionality.</p><p>

<b>WetFeet Insider and RecruitWatch Electronic Newsletters</b><br>
We also provide you with the opportunity to receive selected information about career and recruiting topics through our WetFeet Insider and RecruitWatch electronic newsletters and other free communications. As a registered user, you may opt out of receiving future mailings by changing your subscription preferences on our Site.</p><p>

Our Site uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. </p><p>

When you make a purchase with WetFeet, Inc., we collect your financial information including credit card number on the order form. We also collect your shipping and billing addresses. Contact information from WetFeet's registration forms is used to send orders and may be used to contact you if there is a problem with your order. </p><p>

<b>Privacy Policies of Other Websites</b><br>
Our Site contains links to other sites, including career-related sites. To provide a seamless experience, we may occasionally use framing. Though your browser may indicate that you are at WetFeet.com, you may be on a partner's site. To determine which site you are on, right-click on the site and then select "Properties."

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (e.g., advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising.</p><p>

<b>Security</b><br>
The WetFeet Site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. This includes the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which encrypts information the user inputs into the website. We store your information in a backend database. Only WetFeet website administrators have access to this information.</p><p>
