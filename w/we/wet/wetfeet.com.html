The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this website, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.</p><p>

<b>WetFeet's Privacy Policy</b><br>
WetFeet, Inc., has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our strong commitment to privacy. The following statement explains our information-gathering and - dissemination practices for our site on the World Wide Web at <a href="http://www.wetfeet.com">www.wetfeet.com</a> (the "Site"). This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. </p><p>

<b>Your Privacy</b><br>
When we gather information from insiders for Insider Guides and other career research products, we work hard to provide them anonymity. They are understandably concerned about their privacy, and we go to great lengths to ensure that their identity is never released by WetFeet, Inc., to anyone outside of WetFeet. </p><p>

WetFeet, Inc., values your privacy too. We only request information absolutely essential to the filling of your order or to understand you better so that we can improve our products and services. We will not release name or contact information to third parties without your consent, unless, of course, you're submitting your identity for a purchase from our Site with a credit card. In that case, we will share necessary billing information information with our credit car processor and shipping information with the shipper you designate. Billing information is sent from WetFeet to our credit card processor, CyberCash. We do not store your payment information on our site; it resides on the secure servers of CyberCash indefinitely.</p><p>

However, we may comply with any subpoena, order of court, or request by a regulatory or law enforcement agency to gain access to any of the information that we collect.</p><p>

<b>Online Forums</b><br>
WetFeet, Inc., offers Online Forums to its members. While WetFeet strives to protect your personal information, we cannot provide security for any of the information that you choose to submit to the Forums, as they are essentially open to the public. Please exercise good judgment and protect your passwords and other account information.</p><p>

<b>Cookies</b><br>
At times, we use a feature of your Web browser to send your computer a "cookie," a small data file that's stored on your hard drive. We do not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information from your computer. We use cookies to enhance your experience on our Site and to give you better, more personalized service once you've purchased or registered. Cookies allow us to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site. Cookies also help to optimize the user experience in our Online Forums by recognizing your username and flagging new forum activity since your last visit. We use this information for internal use only; we don't share it with others. If you chose to refuse to accept cookies, you will be unable to purchase Insider Guides or access member-only areas, and you may experience other loss in site functionality.</p><p>

<b>CareerWatch and RecruitWatch Electronic Newsletters</b><br>
We also provide you with the opportunity to receive selected information about career and recruiting topics through our CareerWatch and RecruitWatch electronic newsletters and other free communications. As a registered user, you may opt out of receiving future mailings by changing your subscription preferences on our Site.</p><p>

<b>E-mail-A-Friend</b><br>
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about content from our site, we ask them for the friend's name and e-mail address. WetFeet, Inc., will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site. WetFeet uses this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail and does not store the information after the e-mail is sent. </p><p>

We also ask you to provide us with some additional information, such as your educational background, to better match our information, products, and services with your needs. </p><p>

When you make a purchase with WetFeet, Inc., we collect your financial information including credit card number on the order form. We also collect your shipping and billing addresses. Contact information from WetFeet's registration forms is used to send orders and may be used to contact you if there is a problem with your order. </p><p>

<b>Privacy Policies of Other Websites</b><br>
Our Site contains links to other sites, including career-related sites. To provide a seamless experience, we may occasionally use framing. Though your browser may indicate that you are at WetFeet.com, you may be on a partner's site. To determine which site you are on, right-click on the site and then select "Properties."
