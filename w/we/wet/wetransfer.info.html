<p>By using or accessing the website WeTransfer.com or any website hosted at WeTransfer.com (the “Sites”), or by accessing or using any part of the WeTransfer proprietary file transmission services (together with the Sites, the “Service”), the User agrees to be bound by the WeTransfer Privacy Policy and the WeTransfer Terms and Conditions. If the User does not agree to these terms then there is no right to access or use the Service.</p>
<p>If you have  questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, you should first contact  WeTransfer at <a href="mailto:info@wetransfer.com">info@wetransfer.com</a>. This is the second update of the Privacy Policy of WeTransfer. WeTransfer can update this Privacy Policy from time to time and will handle your information in accordance with the version that was in place when you submitted it. WeTransfer will notify of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. WeTransfer reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently.</p>
<p>The WeTransfer service allows users to send files (up to 2 GB) to one or more recipients identified by a valid email address (the “Service”) either through the WeTransfer.com website (the “Site”).</p>
<p>The Privacy Policy is written for the Personal Information of the users of the service on the Site. Personal Information is data who can be traced to individual persons such as email address, name and the files. The Privacy Policy is also applicable of the use of the Service such as the statistics of the use. WeTransfer uses the Personal Information mainly to provide the Service, complete the transactions, and respond to inquiries. WeTransfer will not sell this Personal information to third parties.</p>
<h2>Log data</h2>
<p>When an user visits the Site or use the Service, our servers automatically record information about the use of the Service and the visit to the Site (“Log Data”). This Log Data includes the filename and file size of all files that you make available via the Service. The Log Data may also include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, the sender email address and receiver(s) email address, the browser type, what Software you were using, the web page you were visiting immediately prior to visiting our Site, pages of our Site that you visited, the time spent on those pages, information you searched for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. WeTransfer uses this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site’s technical administration, to improve our Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs. WeTransfer also uses this information to verify that users of the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Like many websites, WeTransfer uses “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. WeTransfer uses cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site. Second, we utilize session cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by WeTransfer Users and general web traffic on the Site. We link the information we store in cookies to the Personal Information you submit to us while you are on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. WeTransfer does not have access to or control of any cookies that its advertisers may store in your browser and this Privacy Policy does not apply to the use of cookies by advertisers. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the web sites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all the functionality of the Service.<br>
As part of the Service, WeTransfer subscribers may send a file to one or more recipients identified by a valid email address. The message created by a WeTransfer subscriber will be sent from WeTransfer on the WeTransfer subscriber’s behalf to the email addresses the WeTransfer subscriber enters into the online form. These email addresses will be stored in the address book the WeTransfer subscriber creates and will be used only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee. The recipient of a file may contact us at <a href="http://www.wetransfer.info/info@wetransfer.com">info@WeTransfer.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our  database.</p>
<h2>Information sharing and disclosure</h2>
<p>Other than as described in this section, WeTransfer does not rent or share information about you personal or the statistics with third parties, unless due to the performance of an agreement (the hosting-activities for the Service and invoicing) or a writ of execution from a judicial authority or due to the sale or transfer or otherwise share some of its assets of WeTransfer and the information part of the sale is.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>WeTransfer takes safeguarding your information very seriously. WeTransfer employs generally-accepted, industry-standard administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the Personal Information submitted to us from unauthorized access, both during transmission and once we receive it. Wetransfer is using the high-tec datacenter of <a href="http://www.leaseweb.com/" target="_blank">Leaseweb</a>. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic data storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. WeTransfer is not responsible for any harm or damage due to the security.<br>
We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable laws related to security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>
<h2>International transfer</h2>
<p>Your information may be transferred to “and maintained on” computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the Netherlands and European Union and choose to provide information to us, you should be aware that WeTransfer transfers Personal Information to the Netherlands and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to such transfer.</p>
<h2>Links to other sites</h2>
<p>Our Site contains links to other web sites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s web site. The fact that we link to a web site or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party web sites. These other web sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other web sites you visit.</p>
