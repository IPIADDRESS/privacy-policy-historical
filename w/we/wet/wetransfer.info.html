<p>Please be advised that this Privacy Policy is based on Dutch law. If the legislation in the jurisdiction you are living in prohibits or limits your use of the Service, you are responsible for abiding to this legislation.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is WeTransfer.com?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Personal Information is collected and processed by WeTransfer.com?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Log Data</em></strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Site and/or use the Service, our servers automatically record information about your use of the Service and your visit to the Site (“Log Data”). This Log Data includes the filename and file size of all files that you transfer by means of the Service. The Log Data may also include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, the sender email address and receiver(s) email address, the browser type, what software you are using, the web page you were visiting immediately prior to visiting our Site, pages of our Site that you visited, the time spent on those pages, information you searched for on our Site, access times and dates, other statistics and “cookies”.</p>
<p><strong><em>Account data</em></strong></p>
<p>If you have downloaded the Desktop Application from the Site, you must create an Account in order to use the Service. When you create such an Account, you are asked to fill out certain information about yourself. You can always adjust the information you have provided.</p>
<p><strong><em>Corporate Information </em></strong></p>
<p>If you have entered into a Corporate Subscription with WeTransfer.com you must create an Account, in order to use the Service. When you create such an Account, you are asked provide certain Personal Information. You can always adjust the information you have provided.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>3. </strong><strong>What are Cookies and how is WeTransfer.com using them? </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Like many websites, WeTransfer uses “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. WeTransfer uses cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site. Second, we utilize session cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by users of the Service and general web traffic on the Site. We link the information we store in cookies to the Personal Information you submit to us while you are on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser.</p>
<p>Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. WeTransfer does not have access to or control of any cookies that its advertisers may store in your browser and this Privacy Policy does not apply to the use of cookies by advertisers.</p>
<p>You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the web sites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all the functionality of the Service. In order to know more about the possibility to stop accepting cookies we advise you to consult your browser instruction or the “Help” function in your browser.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For what purpose will WeTransfer.com use your Personal Information?</strong></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Purposes</em></p>
<p>WeTransfer.com will use your Personal Information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>to provide the Service to you; and</li>
<li>to send information to you about WeTransfer.com’s own, similar services such as updates and promotional actions of WeTransfer.com; and</li>
<li>to draw up statistical data, to improve the Service and to protect the Service; and</li>
<li>to provide your information to third parties pursuant to legal obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Use by WeTransfer.com</em></p>
<p>In order to perform the Services that are requested by you through our Site, WeTransfer.com will necessarily use (some) the Personal Information you provided.</p>
<p>In addition thereto, WeTransfer.com will keep you informed of the development of its Service. If an expansion is on its way or an update is created, or in case of promotional actions of WeTransfer.com, WeTransfer.com will inform you thereof by email. If you do not want to receive any messages about the Service, you can unsubscribe via this email address [url]. In addition, each individual message includes the possibility to unsubscribe. Please do keep a close eye on the Site so that you know when there is a new update or expansion. Furthermore, please be advised that WeTransfer.com also sends emails in order to correctly provide the Service to you. These emails are essential to the Service. It is therefore not possible to unsubscribe for these emails.</p>
<p>WeTransfer.com uses the Log Data for statistical purposes as well as for protection of the Site and the Service. WeTransfer.com furthermore uses this Log Data to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site’s technical administration, to improve the Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to your needs. WeTransfer also uses this information to verify that users of the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests. These details can be provided to third parties insofar as they cannot be traced back to you personally (i.e. it will not contain any Personal Information).</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>As part of the Service, you may send a file to one or more recipients identified by a valid email address. The message created by you will be sent from WeTransfer.com on your behalf to the email addresses you have entered into the online form. These email addresses will be stored in the address book you have created and will be used by WeTransfer.com only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Use by third parties</em></p>
<p>Other than as described in the Privacy Policy, WeTransfer does not rent or share Personal Information to or with third parties without your explicit consent. However, WeTransfer.com can provide your details to third parties insofar as this is necessary for providing the Service to you, upon your request and/or insofar as these details cannot be traced back to you personally. Finally, WeTransfer.com can provide your details to third parties if they are obliged to do so pursuant to legal provisions, WeTransfer.com is forced to do so as a result of a legal proceeding and/or in the event that WeTransfer.com regards it necessary for the protection of its own rights.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what manner does WeTransfer.com protect your personal Information? </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>WeTransfer takes safeguarding your Personal Information very seriously. WeTransfer employs generally-accepted, industry-standard administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the Personal Information submitted to us from unauthorized access, both during transmission and once we receive it. WeTransfer is using a high-tec datacenter.</p>
<p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic data storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. WeTransfer is not responsible for any harm or damage due to the security.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>6. </strong><strong>Is Personal Information transmitted outside the EU?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>It may be required for technical and operational reasons that your Personal Information is transferred to (servers of) companies affiliated to us in the United   States or other countries outside Europe where the regulations in the field of privacy protection might not provide the same protection as in the European Union. By using the Service you are giving your consent to this.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>7. </strong><strong>Links to other sites</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Our Site contains links to other web sites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s web site. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other web sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. WeTransfer.com does not accept any responsibility or liability for (the operation and/or contents of) websites of third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other web sites you visit.</p>
<p><strong>8. </strong><strong>Transfer of company</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>In the event of a further growth and development of WeTransfer.com it may be that one or more parts of the assets of the company are transferred to a third party or that WeTransfer.com merges with a third party. In that case your Personal Information will also be transferred.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our policy towards minors</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>In principle everybody can use the Service. However, it is important that special legal rules apply to persons who have not yet reached the age of sixteen (16). If you are not yet sixteen (16) you are required to obtain the consent of your parents or legal guardian before you can use the Service. If you are below the age of sixteen (16) and you don’t have this consent, you are not allowed to use the Service.</p>
