      <p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on July 14, 2015.</p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy:</p>

<p>Welcome to the web site (the “Site”) of Wetravel, Inc. (“Wetravel”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Site is operated by Wetravel and has been created to provide information about our company and its services (the “Services”) to our users (“you”, “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Wetravel’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from Site visitors and users of the Services.</p>

<p>Information We Collect:</p>

<p>When you interact with us through the Site or the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p>

<p>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information such as when you register for access to the Services (for example, name, email address, and payment information), use certain Services, contact us with inquiries or respond to one of our surveys. Wherever Wetravel collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Wetravel and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States and abroad.</p>

<p>International Transfer</p>

<p>Your information may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Wetravel transfers personal information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this privacy policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

<p>Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data:</p>

<p>When you interact with Wetravel through the Site or Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Wetravel may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Wetravel affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Wetravel Service. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Wetravel often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. Wetravel may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally. Wetravel may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

<p>In operating this Site, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features.</p>

<p>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</p>

<p>Wetravel uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.</p>

<p>Wetravel and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users and to improve the Services. Wetravel and its Related Companies may use this information to communicate with you regarding the Services or to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below. Note however that as user of the Service you cannot opt-out of some administrative communications that are reasonably necessary to the Service, such as billing or service notifications.</p>

<p>If Wetravel intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.</p>

<p>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</p>

<p>Wetravel is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>

<p>Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</p>

<p>Related Companies: We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Wetravel, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>

<p>Third Party Services: Some portions of the Wetravel Service might implement software solutions from Third Parties (eg Google Maps). Your use of these Third Party Services is subject to the respective service’s term of use. </p>

<p>Legal Requirements: Wetravel may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Wetravel, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p>

<p>Log Data</p>

<p>When you visit the Service, whether as a Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a “Wetravel User”), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to the Service, pages of the Service that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on the Service, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Service and for the Service’s technical administration, to increase the Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Service to our visitors' and users’ needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to and users of the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Data or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying or Aggregated Data.</p>

<p>Listed trips</p>

<p>If you post a trip, we may publish that trip publicly via the Service and may enable third parties to publish your trip on their websites through the use of an HTML “widget” or other. We may also display the geographical location of your trip and your current location in the form of a map so that potential Travelers can see the general area and neighborhood of your Listing, but the actual street address will not be disclosed until you enter into a confirmed transaction with another Member. If you request to make a booking via the Service, Wetravel may share the following information about you with the applicable Wetravel Trip Organizer (“Trip Organizer”): your first and last name and a link to your Wetravel Account profile page. All of this information will enable the Trip Organizer to decide whether to confirm or reject your booking. When a Trip Organizer confirms a booking we may share pieces of the Trip Organizer’s Identify Information, including, but not limited to, full name, phone number, the Experience’s starting address and the Trip Organizer’s email address, with the applicable Traveler selected by the Trip Organizer and we may share pieces of the Traveler’s Identify Information with the Trip Organizer, including, but not limited to, full name, phone number and email address, so that the Traveler and Trip Organizer may contact one another directly. In no event is a Traveler's Billing Information shared with a Trip Organizer.</p>

<p>Testimonials</p>

<p>With your consent we may post your testimonial on the Service along with your name. If you want your testimonial removed please contact us.</p>

<p>Your Choices:</p>

<p>You can use the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain Services.</p>

<p>Exclusions:</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Wetravel other than Personal Data collected through the Site or Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Wetravel through this Site or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Site, such as bulletin boards (collectively, “Public Areas”), any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Wetravel shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute and exploit such Unsolicited Information without limitation or attribution.</p>

<p>Children:</p>

<p>Wetravel does not knowingly collect Personal Data from persons under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Site. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on this Site without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal Data to Wetravel through this Site, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>

<p>Links to Other Web Sites:</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. This Site may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Wetravel (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from this Site do not imply that Wetravel endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</p>

<p>Integrating Third Party Services within the Services:</p>

<p>The Service may allow you to enable various online third party services, such as social media and networking services (“Integrated Services”). By directly integrating these services, we make your online experiences richer and more personalized. To take advantage of this feature, we may ask you to provide us your username and password for the relevant Integrated Service. By enabling or logging in via such Integrated Services, you are allowing us to pass your log-in information to these service providers for this purpose. When you add an Integrated Services account to the Service or log into the Service using your Integrated Services account, we will collect your login information and other relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that Integrated Service and your data contained within that Integrated Service. As part of such integration, the Integrated Service will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to such Integrated Service, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, please remember that the manner in which Integrated Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such third parties, and Wetravel shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Integrated Services that may be enabled within the Service.</p>

<p>Security:</p>

<p>Wetravel takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Site from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet, email or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us in this way.</p>

<p>Other Terms and Conditions:</p>

<p>Your access to and use of this Site is subject to Wetravel’s Terms of Service which can be found on our Website.</p>

<p>Changes to Wetravel’s Privacy Policy:</p>

<p>The Site and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Wetravel to make changes to this Privacy Policy.
