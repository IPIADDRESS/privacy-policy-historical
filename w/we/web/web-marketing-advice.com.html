      <p><b><a name="1">01.</a> Statement of intent</b> <br>
        From time to time, you will be asked to submit personal information about 
        yourself (e.g. name and email address etc) in order to receive or use 
        services on our website. Such services include newsletters, competitions, 
        live chats, message boards and membership. <br>
        <br>
        By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable us and our 
        service providers to provide you with the services you select. Whenever 
        you provide such personal information, we will treat that information 
        in accordance with this policy. Our services are designed to give you 
        the information that you want to receive. We will act in accordance with 
        current legislation and aim to meet current Internet best practice. <br>
        <br>
        <b><a name="2">02.</a> Information on visitors</b> <br>
        During the course of any visit to our site, the pages you see, along with 
        something called a cookie, are downloaded to your computer (see point 
        3 for more on this). Most, if not all, websites do this, because cookies 
        allow the website publisher to do useful things like find out whether 
        the computer (and probably its user) has visited the site before. This 
        is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie 
        left there on the last visit. <br>
        <br>
        Any information that is supplied by cookies can help us to provide you 
        with a better service and assists us to analyse the profile of our visitors. 
        For example: if on a previous visit you went to, say, the education pages, 
        then we might find this out from your cookie and highlight educational 
        information on a second visit. <br>
        <br>
        <b><a name="3">03.</a> What is a cookie?</b> <br>
        When you enter a site your computer will automatically be issued with 
        a cookie. Cookies are text files that identify your computer to our server. 
        Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, just the computer 
        used. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their site in order to 
        track traffic flows. <br>
        <br>
        Cookies themselves only record those areas of the site that have been 
        visited by the computer in question, and for how long. Users have the 
        opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them 
        when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last 
        of these, of course, means that certain personalised services cannot then 
        be provided to that user. <br>
        <br>
        NB: Even if you haven't set your computer to reject cookies you can still 
        browse our site anonymously until such time as you register for our services. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><a name="4">04.</a> Use and storage of your personal information</b> 
        <br>
        When you supply any personal information to us (e.g. for competitions, 
        services or membership) we have legal obligations towards you in the way 
        we deal with that data. We must collect the information fairly, that is, 
        we must explain how we will use it (see the notices on particular webpages 
        that let you know why we are requesting the information) and tell you 
        if we want to pass the information on to anyone else. In general, any 
        information you provide to us will only be used by us and by our service 
        providers. It will never be supplied to anyone externally without first 
        obtaining your consent, unless we are obliged or permitted by law to disclose 
        it. Also, if you post or send offensive or inappropriate content anywhere 
        on or to us and then we consider such behaviour to be serious and/or repeated, 
        we can use whatever information that is available to it about you to stop 
        such behaviour. This may include informing relevant third parties such 
        as your employer, school or e-mail provider about the content and your 
        behaviour. <br>
        <br>
        We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you 
        use the service you have requested, and remove it in the event that the 
        purpose has been met, or, in the case of membership you no longer wish 
        to continue your registration as a member. For safety reasons, however, 
        we may store messaging transcript data (including message content, member 
        names, times and dates) arising from the use of our services for a period 
        of six months. Where personal information is held for people who are not 
        yet registered but have taken part in other services (eg competitions), 
        that information will be held only as long as necessary to ensure that 
        the service is run smoothly. We will ensure that all personal information 
        supplied is held securely, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 
        1998. <br>
        <br>
        If you are notified on our site that your information may be used to allow 
        us to contact you for "service administration purposes", this means that 
        we may contact you for a number of purposes related to the service you 
        have signed up for. For example, we may wish to provide you with password 
        reminders or notify you that the particular service has been suspended 
        for maintenance. We will not contact you for promotional purposes, such 
        as notifying you of improvements to the service or new services unless 
        you specifically agree to be contacted for such purposes at the time you 
        submit your information on the site, or at a later time if you sign up 
        specifically to receive such promotional information. <br>
        <br>
        <b><a name="5">05.</a> Access to your personal information</b> <br>
        You have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold 
        about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. <br>
        <br>
        <b><a name="6">06.</a> Users 16 and under</b> <br>
        If you are aged 16 or under, please get your parent/guardian's permission 
        beforehand whenever you provide personal information to our website. Users 
        without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information.

        <b><a name="7"></a></b><strong>7. Data collection by Conversion Tracking</strong> 
        (Data collection by Conversion Tracking) <br>
         Our site(s) use a cookie to measure advertising performance 
        for advertisers who have opted in to conversion tracking on Google and 
        its AdSense partners websites.The conversion tracking cookie 
        is set when a user clicks on an ad delivered by Google where the advertiser 
        has opted in to tracking. These cookies expire within 30 days and are 
        not personally identifiable. If this cookie has not yet expired when the 
        user visits certain pages of the advertiserâ€™s website, Google and the 
        advertiser will be able to tell that the user clicked the ad and proceeded 
        to that page. Each advertiser gets a different cookie, so no cookie can 
        be tracked across advertiser websites. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How we use the conversion cookie information <br>
          <br>
          We use the information collected by the conversion cookie to provide 
          aggregate conversion stats to advertisers who have opted in to conversion 
          tracking. Advertisers are able to see the total number of users who 
          have clicked on their ad and proceeded to a page tagged with a conversion 
          tracking tag, but they do not have access to personally identifying 
          information.<br>
          </li>
        <li>How to opt out of the conversion cookie <br>
          <br>
          If you want to disable conversion tracking cookies, you can set your 
          browser to block cookies from the googleadservices.com domain.
