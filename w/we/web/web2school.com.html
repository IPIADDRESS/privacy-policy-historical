<h1 style="color:#ff8040">Wicked Good Software Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>(As of: December 1, 2014)</p>

<p></p>

<p>At Wicked Good Software ("WickedGood", “WGS”, "we", "us" or
"our"), we respect your privacy, and we understand the importance of the
information you entrust to us. This Privacy Policy describes our practices
concerning the information collected through our website or any of our related
applications (the “Services”). Below we describe what information
we collect when you use the Services, how we protect that information, with
whom we share it, and what your privacy options are. By using the Services, you
consent to our collection and use of your data as described in this Privacy
Policy. This Privacy Policy only applies to properties we own and operate. Our
properties may provide links to third party websites and this Privacy Policy
will not apply to any information you may provide while on such third party
websites. We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy against new
technologies, business practices, and our users’ needs, and may make
changes to the Privacy Policy accordingly. Please check this page periodically
for updates. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will
post the updated Privacy Policy here, along with its effective date, and notify
you by email or by means of a notice on our website.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>The Information We Collect</h3>

<p>We explain the two ways that we collect and process information about
you.</p>

<p><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong></p>

<p><strong>Account Information:</strong> You may choose to create an account
and provide us with information in order to use certain services or to take
advantage of special offers. If you create an account on WickedGood, we may
store and use information such as your full name, email address, zip code,
gender and birth date. You may provide this information directly to us or you
may choose to register using your Facebook account in which case you would
authorize us to access certain Facebook profile information including, but not
limited to, your first name, last name, gender, birth date and email address.
Please be mindful that your username from your email address, as well as your
Facebook photo or any photo you submit through the registration process, will
be publicly displayed as part of your account profile. You can always edit some
of the information associated with your account here, or if you believe that an
unauthorized account has been created using your name, or likeness, you can
request its removal by using our online form <a href="http://wickdgood.com/contact.html">here</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Public Content:</strong> You may also choose to post content (such
as ratings, reviews, tips, photos or comments, likes, bookmarks, friends,
lists) that may be shared with others through our Services or through your
Facebook account. The information that you post to the Services is intended to
be available for other users of WickedGood to read, including your posted
content and reviews about businesses with which you transact through the
Services, and your account profile. We may display this information on the
Services, share it with businesses, and further distribute it to a wider
audience through third party sites and services.</p>

<p><strong>Contacts:</strong> You have the option to invite those of your
friends that you think would like to join the Services, by providing their
contact information. If you invite a friend to join and connect with you on the
Services, we will only use your friend’s contact information to process
your requests.</p>

<p><strong>Communications:</strong> If you participate in a survey, poll,
promotion, contest, or sweepstakes; submit a customer service or other inquiry
to us; request to receive certain communications from us; or contact us about
employment opportunities posted to the Services, we may collect contact
information such as your name, address, email address, or telephone number.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Information We Collect When you Use the Services</strong></p>

<p>When you use the Services, we automatically collect and store certain
information about your computer or device and your activities, including:</p>
<ol>
  <li>IP address of your computer</li>
  <li>Unique mobile device identifier</li>
  <li>Technical information about your computer or mobile device such as type
    of device, mobile device ID number, web browser (Internet Explorer 8,
    etc.), other browser information (e.g. size, connection speed and
    connection type), and operating system or platform (Mac, Windows XP,
  etc.)</li>
  <li>Your preferences and settings (time zone, language, etc.)</li>
  <li>If you are using a mobile device, your mobile device's geographic
    location (specific geographic location if you've enabled collection of that
    information, or general geographic location automatically). Please see the
    section "How to Disable the Collection of Mobile Device Location
    Information" below for further information.</li>
  <li>Internet provider (Verizon, Comcast, etc.) or mobile carrier name
    (AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, etc.)</li>
  <li>The URL of the last webpage you visited before visiting WickedGood</li>
  <li>Information about your activity on the Services (e.g., your search
    queries, comments, search results selected, clicks, pages viewed, how long
    you visited our Services, etc.)</li>
  <li>Communications between you and other users or merchants through our
    Services</li>
  <li>For mobile application users, the online or offline status of your
    application.</li>
</ol>

<p>How to Disable the Collection of Mobile Device Location Information. When
you use one of our location-enabled services (for example, when you access
Services from a mobile device), we may need to collect and process information
about your actual GPS location (including the latitude, longitude or altitude
of your mobile device) and the time the location information was recorded. Some
of these services require your personal data for the feature to work and we may
associate location data with your device ID and other information we hold about
you. We keep this data for no longer than is reasonably necessary for providing
our services. If you wish to use the particular feature, you will be asked to
consent to your data being used for this purpose. You can withdraw your consent
at any time by disabling the relevant feature. If you do not want your location
information collected when you use the Services from a mobile device, please
follow these instructions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are using an Apple device, click on “General,” then
    “Reset,” then “Reset Location and Privacy.” This
    will turn off location functionality for all of your applications so that
    the next time you download or use an application, you will be asked again
    to provide your consent for us and others to access your location
    information.</li>
  <li>If you are using an Android device, visit device settings, click
    “Location,” and then click the boxes for the particular
    applications for which you would like to disable location services.</li>
  <li>If your device changes the above methods of disabling the collection of
    mobile device location, please contact your device manufacturer or platform
    provider to determine how to disable the collection of this
  information.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h4>Cookies, Mobile Device IDs and Online Advertising:</h4>

<p><em><strong>Cookies:</strong></em> We, and third parties with whom we
partner, may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, mobile device IDs,
“flash cookies” and similar files or technologies to collect and
store information in in respect to your use of the Services and third party
websites(). A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer that
enables us to recognize you (for example, as a registered user) when you visit
our website, store your preferences and settings, enhance your experience by
delivering content specific to your interests, perform research and analytics,
track your use of our Services, and assist with security and administrative
functions. Cookies may be persistent or stored only during an individual
session. To understand more about cookies, go to http://allaboutcookies.org.</p>

<p><em><strong>Managing your Cookie Settings:</strong></em> Most browsers are
set to automatically allow cookies. <strong>Please note it may be possible to
disable some (but not all) Cookies through your device or browser settings, but
doing so may affect your ability to use the Service.</strong> In addition,
deleting or disabling cookies on one browser is unlikely to delete them on
other browsers or other computers. Thus, you may have to delete or disable
cookies in more than one location. Major browsers provide users with various
options when it comes to cookies. Users can usually set their browsers to block
all third-party cookies (which are those set by third-party companies
collecting information on websites operated by other companies), block all
cookies (including first-party cookies such as the ones WickedGood uses to
collect search activity information about its users), or block specific
cookies. To modify your cookie settings, please refer to the following support
pages for each browser you use to access the WickedGood website:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Internet Explorer help: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/278835</li>
  <li>Firefox help: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Cookies#Firefox</li>
  <li>Safari help: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH5042</li>

</ul>

<p>A pixel tag (also called a web beacon or clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a
unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email),
and is used to count or track things like activity on a webpage or ad
impressions or clicks, as well as to access cookies stored on users’
computers. WickedGood pixel tags are used to measure the popularity of our
various pages, features and services.Advertising company pixel tags are used to
measure the number of ad impressions and the performance of ads on our site,
and to access the advertising company’s cookies placed on your computer.
Data analytics company pixel tags are used to aggregate information about our
advertising and your engagement with our site for market research, product
improvement, revenue tracking and advertising optimization. Third parties whose
products or services are accessible or advertised through the Services,
including social networking services, may also use cookies or similar tools,
and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their
cookies and other practices.</p>

<p><em><strong>Online and Mobile Advertising:</strong></em> We may allow third
parties to use Cookies on the Service to collect the same type of information
for the same purposes as WickedGood does for itself. Advertisers and
advertising networks place ads on our website and mobile applications. These
companies as well as data analytics companies who service them may collect
information, such as your computer’s IP address, browser information,
mobile device ID, and search queries, as you use our Services. These companies
also may use cookies and pixel tags to collect data about you when you visit
our site. Cookies from advertising companies enable them to track your activity
across various sites where they display ads and record and associate your
activities, so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you. We do not,
as a matter of course, have access to, or control over the Cookies these third
parties use, but you may be able to opt-out of some of their practices, by
visiting the links listed below. Please note however that opting out will not
stop the display of advertisement to you.</p>

</ul>

<p>If you are using an WickedGood mobile application, we use your unique mobile
device ID number to recognize you when you use the application, to store your
preferences and settings and to track your use of our Services. Advertising
companies may also use and store your mobile device ID to track your use of the
Services, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and show
ads that they consider relevant to you in various mobile services that you
use.If you are using an iOS device and you do not want to receive tailored
in-application ads that relate to your interests, you may opt-out by accessing
the following link on your device: http://oo.apple.com. If you are using an
iOS6 device, you also may limit the delivery of tailored ads by: Open Settings
and tap “General” then tap “About”; Scroll to the
bottom of About and tap “Advertising”; Flip “Limit Ad
Tracking” to ON. If you are using an Android device and you do not wish
to receive tailored in-application ads, you can visit Google’s Ads
Preferences page from a browser on your device and make your choices there. We
do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control
receiving tailored in-application ads; thus, you should contact the platform
provider if the above options are no longer available.</p>

    enforcement authorities, courts, or regulators, or otherwise to comply with
    the law, we may disclose any information we have about our users. We also
    may disclose information collected about you in order to exercise or
    protect legal rights or defend against legal claims.</li>
