<b>Have You Told Your Visitors About Their Privacy?</b>

More and more, privacy is becoming an important issue 
with your visitors. They want to know exactly what you're 
planning to do with their personal information you collect. 

Create a page on your website called, "Privacy Statement,"
and let your visitors know your intentions. 

- How do you plan on using their information

- Is their information sold or shared with a third party

- Why do you collect their email address and how will it
be used

- Why do you track their IP address

- Let your visitors know that you're not responsible for 
the privacy issues of any outside websites you may be 
linking to

- Why do you use order forms and what do you do with the
information acquired

- Do you run contests and what do you do with the information

- Do you have a discussion forum or message board? Let your
visitors know that any information that is disclosed in these 
areas becomes public information and they should exercise caution 

- Do you have security measures in place to protect the loss, 
misuse and alteration of the information under your control? If
so, let your visitors know

- Let your visitors know how they can opt out of your mailing
lists

- Provide your visitors with your contact information, should
they have any questions in regard to your privacy statement.

                  </p><blockquote> 
                    <h3>Big Brother IS Watching You! Privacy Online!</h3>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By Mike Banks Valentine<br>
                    <br>
                    Did you know that you are willingly providing information 
                    to the world with every site you visit, every product you 
                    buy. Your mailing address, your phone number, your sexual 
                    preferences (based on sites you may have visited), your resumé 
                    are available, literally to the entire world?<br>
                    <br>
                    Personal privacy on the web is non-existent and detailed information 
                    on you and your family, your income, your tax information, 
                    employment history, legal documents and e-mail, are becoming 
                    easily accessible to anyone who wants them. Good guy, bad 
                    guy or even your own dear mother. <br>
                    <br>
                    It's all becoming more available to the world with each site 
                    you visit, each product you purchase and each e-mail you send. 
                    That's right, your e-mail is not private, and can be accessed 
                    by any bright kid with a modem and too much spare time on 
                    his hands.<br>
                    <br>
                    It's widely known that e-mail is being used as evidence in 
                    court cases to convict hackers, software moguls and corporate 
                    executives of various wrongdoings. You’re an innocent? 
                    You erased it? Doesn't matter, the receiver and those that 
                    were sent a copy of your message may have an edited, incriminating, 
                    misleading, archived copy. And it can be intercepted and read 
                    on route to it's destination!<br>
                    <br>
                    There are answers out there to keep your e-mail more secure, 
                    like the encryption key based "envelope" provided 
                    by services like <a href="http://www.privacyX.com">http://www.privacyX.com</a> 
                    to protect your identity and stop others from tracking and 
                    reading those notes you send that you believe are private.<br>
                    <br>
                    As you sign up for the PrivacyX service, though, read the 
                    "Terms of Service" (membership agreement) carefully. 
                    The TOS says "we can access your mail" So it's private 
                    from everyone except the provider. Better to be visible to 
                    one than many, but Chief Privacy Officer David Renardson of 
                    PrivacyX.com, Inc. insists not only that they don't collect, 
                    monitor or distribute any of your personally identifying information, 
                    but that they are seeking ways to <b>prove</b> that to members 
                    of their service.<br>
                    <br>
                    They don't admit to anything other than "providing it 
                    in aggregate to advertisers". Essentially the language 
                    used in most web site "Terms of Service" agreements means 
                    that they could do anything they like with your information. 
                    It's a kind of "Trust me" statement.<br>
                    <br>
                    And therein lies the problem with privacy policies and even 
                    in third party audits. You have to trust someone. Third party 
                    seal programs like <a href="http://www.bbbonline.com/">BBBonline</a> 
                    and <a href="http://www.truste.com/">Truste.com</a> have come 
                    under fire repeatedly for refusing to ban offending members 
                    for privacy infractions. They insist on an audit and review 
                    of the bad guys, before they will penalize or revoke their 
                    membership. Meanwhile, the seals remain posted reassuringly 
                    at sites that don't honor their own privacy policies or those 
                    of the seal programs! No wonder public trust in any privacy 
                    claims is waning. 
                    <p> Another option for safer surfing is a software solution 
                      by <a href="&#10;http://www.zeroknowledge.com/clickthrough/click.asp?partner_id=4489&#10;">ZeroKnowledge</a>. Although we have not tested this software personally, it 
                      is well recognized as a viable solution for web privacy 
                      protection.
                    </p><p> Then there are the sites like Lexis-Nexis "People 
                      Locator"<br>
                      <a href="http://www.lexis-nexis.com/lncc/general/privacy_info2.html">http://www.lexis-nexis.com/lncc/general/privacy_info2.html</a> 
                      At this site they provide "subscribers" of their 
                      service with "publicly available" information 
                      as well as "some non- publicly available" information. 
                      Fortunately there is a way to "opt-out" of their 
                      database, by sending your name, address and phone number 
                      <a href="mailto:removal@prod.lexis-nexis.com">mailto:removal@prod.lexis-nexis.com</a> 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Whew! Now you're outta there! But wait! At Lexis-Nexis there's 
                      a reference to the "IRSG" or Individual Reference 
                      Services Group, which is a business consortium that make 
                      a living off of selling your information to anyone willing 
                      to pay for it. In their own words, the group is made up 
                      of "commercial services that provide data to help identify, 
                      verify, or locate individuals".<br>
                      <br>
                      Now you have to go to each of the members of the IRSG and 
                      check each member privacy policy (links kindly provided) 
                      <a href="http://www.irsg.org/html/irsg_members.htm">http://www.irsg.org/html/irsg_members.htm</a> 
                      by the members. (Although the privacy policy links for two 
                      of these IRSG members return a "404 not found" 
                      error. Hmmmm. And when I visited the "TransUnion" 
                      privacy policy page I got a "HTTP/1.1 Application Restarting" 
                      message repeatedly.<br>
                      <br>
                      Some provide opt-out options, others don't, but you can 
                      approach each of the credit reporting agencies, locator 
                      services and other information verification companies through 
                      the contact information they provide and give them a piece 
                      of your mind if you like.<br>
                      <br>
                      Don't expect to get far with services like CDB InfoTech 
                      (recently become ChoicePoint) as when you reach their privacy 
                      policy page link you'll find that they . . . "do not 
                      allow individuals to "opt-out" of our databases." 
                      because CDB "only serves legitimate businesses and 
                      government agencies that have an appropriate need for the 
                      information we report." Hmmmm. I guess it's up to them 
                      what's legitimate and who's appropriate.<br>
                      <br>
                      Now all of the foregoing was interesting, but there is one 
                      particular issue that relates specifically to the web and 
                      your surfing, buying and e-mailing habits. You should know 
                      by now that every site you visit can place a "cookie" 
                      on your hardrive which will record a few&lt; crumbs of information 
                      about you.<br>
                      <br>
                      This is harmless enough at first glance when all they seem 
                      to care about is the time, date, length of stay and pages 
                      you visited at their site. But when you know that advertisers 
                      that serve ads from the sites you visit can also track your 
                      visit, link it to other stored data about you gathered at 
                      other sites and finally to any other information they have 
                      stored about you, how do you feel? <br>
                      <br>
                      This means that the harmless little "session number" 
                      or "state data" gathered about you from every 
                      site you've ever visited, every product you've ever purchased 
                      online and every banner you've ever clicked on is stored 
                      in the database of the ad server and distributed to it's 
                      clients!<br>
                      <br>
                      It is possible to set your browser to the "Do Not Accept 
                      Any Cookies" option. I recommend you try it once, if 
                      only for the enlightenment about how many sources are collecting 
                      information about you. Some web pages will send as many 
                      as a dozen requests for cookies and many web sites tell 
                      you flatly that in order to use their online service "cookies 
                      must be enabled on your browser" to use the site.<br>
                      <br>
                      It gets tiring and frustrating clicking the "OK" 
                      button in the warning box that appears each time your browser&lt; 
                      detects a request to set a cookie on your hard drive, if 
                      you've checked the "notify me" option in preferences. 
                      If you want to know who's collected information about you 
                      online, I've discovered a neat little free download that 
                      will keep you informed. Cookie Viewer software:<br>
                      <br>
                      <a href="http://www.winmag.com/library/1998/0901/how0063.htm">http://www.winmag.com/library/1998/0901/how0063.htm</a><br>
                      <br>
                      If you want to get a clearer picture of how cookies can 
                      be used to invade your privacy, I recommend an amazing demonstration 
                      of how you can be followed around the web without your knowledge. 
                      Privacy.net has set up a demo at:<br>
                      <br>
                      <a href="http://www.privacy.net/track/">http://www.privacy.net/track/</a><br>
                      <br>
                      You'll see how providing information in bits and pieces 
                      to multiple web sites creates a cumulative database on your 
                      travels, habits and preferences online. Prepare to be mildly 
                      miffed or fully outraged, depending on your level of concern 
                      with invasion of privacy.<br>
                      <br>
                      The final frontier (one becoming legislated by the FTC) 
                      is that of information gathered by web sites in order to 
                      provide “services” to you online such as chat, 
                      email, directories, instant messaging and other membership 
                      type services. It has become routine for each of these online 
                      service providers to ask detailed information about you 
                      when you register with them.<br>
                      <br>
                      The Federal Trade Commission ( http://www.ftc.gov ) has 
                      already established the “Children’s Online Privacy 
                      Protection Act” or COPPA to require those businesses 
                      that collect information from children under 13 to make 
                      that information restricted to third parties such as advertisers. 
                      The FTC also requires businesses to obtain “verifiable 
                      parental consent” in order to collect any&lt; information 
                      from kids and provide parents access to and allow them to 
                      edit or delete any information there.<br>
                      <br>

                      It all adds up to one very daunting task if you seek anonymity 
                      online, although one web site also provides “safe surfing” 
                      by offering a service by which your information is disguised 
                      through a proxy server:<br>

                      <br>
                      and a software download to provide privacy ratings:<br>

                      <br>
                      What it all comes down to is this, you must be fully informed 
                      about what information is gathered about you, how it will 
                      be used and to whom it is made available. Practice Safe 
                      Surfing!<br>
