	  <br>
	  <h2>last Updated - July 18, 2006</h2>
	<p>As part of Web Profits' business practice, we support the protection of 
	people's privacy rights. We are committed to maintaining the highest 
	standard of privacy and security in the way we conduct our business, from 
	both the company and the associate (employee) level. Web Profits and its 
	associates pledge to conduct our business according to the following 
	principles.</p>
	<p><b>Privacy Practices for Web Profits</b></p>
	<p>Web Profits recognises that consumers have rights regarding the use and 
	dissemination of information about themselves. Web Profits adheres to the 
	National Privacy Principles and is fully compliant with the Privacy 
	Amendment (Private Sector) Act of 2000 of Australia.</p>
	<p>In undertaking developments for our clients, we design and implement 
	based on these privacy considerations. Each site we develop has its own 
	privacy policy that is the responsibility of our clients.</p>
	<p>On the Web Profits site we collect information that is used for our 
	marketing and communications activities. The following information pertains 
	to that data:</p>
	<p><b>Web Profits Site</b></p>
	<p>On this site we may ask for and collect personally identifiable 
	information in order to provide a customised experience and communicate with 
	you. You are given notice of this request and have the ability to choose the 
	information you wish to share with Web Profits. You will be informed about 
	how Web Profits may use such information, including whether it will be 
	shared with carefully selected third parties. In most cases, the information 
	you provide is added to our database in order for Web Profits to provide 
	personally tailored messages which are delivered online and offline. You 
	will always be offered the choice not to provide personally identifiable 
	information or to have it shared with others.</p>
	<p>Please note that Web Profits does not control and will not be responsible 
	for the privacy policies of third party sites, including site not controlled 
	or authorized by Web Profits. Third party site that are accessed through 
	links on our site have separate privacy and data collection practices, and 
	security measures. We have no responsibility or liability for the practices, 
	policies and security measures implemented by third parties on their site. 
	We encourage you to contact them to ask questions about their privacy 
	practices, policies and security measures before disclosing personal 
	information to them.</p>
	<p><b>Security</b></p>
	<p>We respect our visitors' privacy. Personally identifiable information can 
	be accessed and updated by the visitor during and after the registration 
	process. Security is provided concerning names, addresses, email addresses 
	and any other personal information that visitors may provide within the 
	subscription and contact portions of our site. Although "guaranteed 
	security" does not exist either on or off the Internet, we safeguard our 
	visitors' personally identifiable information by using industry standard 
	practices.</p>
	<p><b>Cookies and Invisible Pixels</b></p>
	<p>A cookie is a very small text file that is sent to a user's browser from 
	a web server and stored on the user's computer hard drive. It assigns the 
	computer a unique identifier. It is essentially the user's identification 
	card when he/she returns to the Web Profits site. Cookies save you time 
	because they help us to provide a customized experience without having to 
	remind us of your preferences each time you return to our web pages. Web 
	Profits cookies cannot damage files, nor can they read information from the 
	hard drive of a computer.</p>
	<p>Cookies can help us provide our visitors with a personalized online 
	experience in the following ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They ensure visitors are provided with the appropriate content</li>
		<li>They ensure visitors obtain the information requested</li>
		<li>They help us deliver communications that are relevant and targeted 
		to our visitors' interests</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Web Profits cookies do not follow visitors when travelling on the 
	Internet after leaving the Web Profits site. We track the usage of our site 
	in order to modify it according to our visitors' needs. We pay attention to 
	what information is requested and attempt to make it easier to find such 
	information in the future.</p>
	<p>If visitors do not want the benefits of these cookies they can set their 
	browser to reject the cookies. Visitors should consult the instructions for 
	their particular browser on how to do this. However, visitors should 
	understand that rejecting cookies might affect their ability to perform 
	certain transactions on our site and our ability to recognise their browser 
	from one visit to the next.</p>
	<p>Web Profits also uses invisible pixels, sometimes called web beacons, to 
	count how many people visit certain web pages. Information collected from 
	invisible pixels is used and reported in the aggregate without personally 
	identifiable information. Web Profits may use this information to improve 
	marketing programs and content.</p>
	<p><b>Access to Individual Profiles</b></p>
	<p>Within the subscription process we provide a profile section. Filling in 
	this information allows us to understand and provide services to visitors. 
	We respect our visitors' privacy and maintain their profile information on 
	secure servers. Personally identifiable information can be accessed and 
	updated by the visitor with the assistance of a Web Profits representative. 
	Web Profits will not use our visitor's confidential information for purposes 
	which are not disclosed to or authorised by the visitor. Visitors have the 
	opportunity to review the information they provide and update it at any 
	time.</p>
	<p>Occasionally, information that a visitor requests to be removed will be 
	retained in certain files in order to properly resolve disputes or to 
	troubleshoot problems. In addition, information is never completely removed 
	from our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including stored 
	"back up" systems. Therefore, visitors should not expect that all of their 
	personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our 
	databases in response to their requests.</p>
	<p>Data collected by Web Profits is an asset. It is possible that Web 
	Profits, its subsidiaries, affiliates, joint venture companies, or any 
	combination of the foregoing, could merge with or be acquired by another 
	legal entity. In such event, visitors should expect that Web Profits may 
	share some or all of the data collected from its visitors with such other 
	entity; provided, that such other entity will be notified of the practices 
	which apply to personally identifiable information under Web Profits 
	applicable privacy policy.</p>
	<p><b>Email</b></p>
	<p>From time to time, and including during the subscription process Web 
	Profits asks visitors for their email address in order to provide relevant 
	information such as newsletters, replies to requests and other special 
	offers. Email addresses may be joined with other information provided at our 
	website and may also be augmented with other data sources. By providing 
	their email address to us, visitors may receive email. Visitors will always 
	have the ability to accept or decline email communications from Web Profits.</p>
	<p>Email communication is sent only to people who have consented to receive 
	email from Web Profits or by our carefully selected third parties. At the 
	time of email capture, Web Profits will advise the visitor that we will use 
	the email address for service and product information, as well as marketing 
	and promotional communications. At any time a visitor may opt-out of 
	receiving email communication by following the directions posted in every 
	email, or by following the directions at Web Profits website or by 
	contacting the Web Profits Systems Administrator to opt out of email 
	communication.</p>
	<p>Visitors may receive periodic offers and information from Web Profits 
	about our products and services, as well as offers and information from Web 
	Profits carefully selected marketing partners. Visitors may also receive 
	offers and information directly from these selected third parties. Visitors

	<p><b>Direct Mail and Outbound Telemarketing</b></p>
	<p>As part of the service that Web Profits provides visitors to its site, 
	Web Profits may mail or call visitors to inform them of enhancements, 
	changes in offerings, special events, or other relevant information

	<p>by phone: +61 2 9911 7780<br>
	by fax: +61 2 9516 2845</p>
	<p>Writing to us at:<br>
	Web Profits Pty Ltd<br>
	GPO Box 856<br>
	Sydney NSW 2001</p>
	<p>In all cases please attention your questions or comments to the Privacy 
	Administrator.</p>
	<p><b>Sweepstakes and Contests</b></p>
	<p>Sometimes Web Profits runs sweepstakes and contests. We ask people who 
	participate to give us their contact information (like their email address). 
	If a visitor participates in a sweepstakes or contest, his/her contact 
	information may be used to reach him/her in connection with the sweepstakes 
	or contest, and for other promotional, marketing and business purposes.</p>
	<p>All Web Profits sweepstakes/contests entry forms will provide a way for 
	participants to opt-out of any communication from the sweepstake's/contest's 
	manager that is not related to awarding prizes for the sweepstake/contest. 
	Entry forms will further provide contestants with a choice whether to 
	receive email marketing materials from our carefully selected third parties. 
	When a visitor enters a Web Profits sweepstakes/contest, the information the 
	visitor provides is not shared with any third party, unless the visitor 
	agrees to such by checking the opt-in box on the sweepstakes/contest entry 
	form. By accepting the prize, the winner agrees that Web Profits (and those 
	acting under its authority) may use the winner's name, picture/portrait, 
	likeness and/or voice for advertising and other promotional purposes without 
	further consideration, unless prohibited by law.</p>
	<p><b>Research</b></p>
	<p>From time to time Web Profits may perform research (online and offline) 
	via surveys. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information 
	collected will only be used for research and reporting purposes, to help Web 
	Profits to better serve its visitors by learning more about their needs. The 
	survey responses may also be used to determine the effectiveness of our 
	site, various types of communications, topical opinion, marketing research, 
	advertising campaigns, and/or promotional activities.</p>
	<p>If a visitor participates in a survey, the information given by the 
	visitor will be used along with that of other study participants (for 
	example, Web Profits might report that 50% of a survey's respondents are 
	women). Web Profits may share anonymous individual and aggregate data for 
	research and analysis purposes.</p>
	<p>Web Profits may also contact participants through email for other 
	purposes if given permission to do so. For example, if participants indicate 
	in the survey that they wish to join a Web Profits online research panel. 
	When a participant submits a survey, the email address and the response to 
	the "future contact" question described above, are automatically stored in a 
	database that is intentionally separated from the participant's survey 
	responses. Therefore, the participant's email address is not tied back to 
	the survey responses. Web Profits will not share with third parties the 
	personally identifiable information provided by a survey participant in 
	response to survey questions. For all other purposes, only aggregate data 
	that is devoid of all personally identifiable information will be used.</p>
	<p>In the course of providing surveys to visitors, a cookie may be placed on 
	their browser in order to control the research process, primarily to stop 
	people from being asked to take the same survey twice - or being allowed to 
	take the same survey twice. In addition, the types of advertising visitors 
	view in emails received or on site during the course of their web surfing, 
	may be connected to the visitor's anonymous survey responses.</p>
	<p>Participation in Web Profits surveys is voluntary. Participants who do not 
	wish to receive email communications from Web Profits may opt-out of the 
	receipt of such communication by notifying us in the contact us section 
	provided below.</p>
	<p><b>Periodic Review and Modifications<br>
	</b><br>
	This privacy policy was created on July 18, 2006. Web Profits recommend that 
	visitors review this Privacy Statement periodically, as Web Profits may 
	revise it from time to time.</p>
