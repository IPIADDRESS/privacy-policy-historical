      <h1>Webmaker Privacy</h1>
      <h3>June 15, 2013</h3>
      <p>We care about your privacy. When Mozilla (that’s us) collects information 
        about you from Webmaker, our <a href="https://webmaker.org/privacy">privacy policy</a> 
        describes how we handle that information.</p>

      <h2>Things you should know</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>This site and the ones linked to it or embedded in it uses web 
          technologies that may store data in your browser, including “cookies”, 
          which are small pieces of data stored in your browser.
          <ul>
            <li>Webmaker uses cookies to provide its functionality 
              (such as remembering you between sessions) and to help us understand 
              how users use the service through aggregate analytics.</li>
            <li>Other users may embed content from other online services which 
              may include cookies and other web technologies. You should check the 
              privacy policies of those services to understand their privacy practices.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You may elect to receive email from us and can unsubscribe from any 
          email marketing communications you elected to receive.</li>
        <li>You must create an account to publish content. All the content you 
          publish will be accessible publicly. Profile information you choose to 
          place on public portions of Webmaker (like your username) may be viewed 
          by others.</li>
        <li>Webmaker may allow you to schedule a time and place for events 
          (such as hackathons) or find out where these types of events are 
          occurring. Mozilla does not have any control over events organized 
          by users so please take care if you attend an event.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mozilla Privacy Policy</h2>

      <p>Your privacy is an important factor that Mozilla (that's us) considers 
        in the development of each of our products and services. We are committed 
        to being transparent and open and want you to know how we receive information 
        about you, and what we do with that information once we have it.</p>

      <h2>What do we mean by "personal information?"</h2>

      <p>For us, "personal information" means information which identifies you, 
        like your name or email address.</p>
      <p>Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information."</p>
      <p>If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, 
        we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove 
        all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is 
        non-personal information.</p>

      <h2>How do we learn information about you?</h2>
      <p>We learn information about you when:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>you give it to us directly;</li>
        <li>we collect it automatically through our products and services;</li>
        <li>someone else tells us information about you; or</li>
        <li>when we try and understand more about you based on information you've given to us.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What do we do with your information once we have it?</h2>
      <p>When you give us personal information, we will use it in the ways for 
        which you've given us permission. Generally, we use your information to 
        help us provide and improve our products and services for you.</p>

      <h2>When do we share your information with others?</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>When we have gotten your permission to share it.</li>
        <li>For processing or providing products and services to you, but only 
          if those entities receiving your information are contractually obligated 
          to handle the data in ways that are approved by Mozilla.</li>
        <li>When we are fulfilling our 
          <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/about/manifesto/">mission of being open</a>. 
          We sometimes release information to make our products better and 
          foster an open web, but when we do so, we will remove your personal 
          information and try to disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk 
          of you being re-identified.</li>
        <li>When the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we receive 
          requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit. We'll 
          notify you when we're asked to hand over your personal information in 
          this way unless we're legally prohibited from doing so. When we receive 
          requests like this, we'll only release your personal information if we 
          have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. Nothing in 
          this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that 
          you may have to a third party's request to disclose your information.</li>
        <li>When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else. 
          We will only share your information in this way if we have a good faith 
          belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property 
          or safety of you, our other users, Mozilla or the public.</li>
        <li>If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a 
          restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your 
          information to a successor or affiliate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How do we store and protect your personal information?</h2>
      <p>We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have 
        it. We implement physical, business and technical security measures. 
        Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll notify 
        you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.</p>

      <p>We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we 
        need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for. 
        Once we don't need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are 
        required by law to keep it longer.</p>

      <h2>What else do we want you know?</h2>
      <p>We're a global organization and our computers are in several different 
        places around the world. We also use service providers whose computers 
        may also be in various countries. This means that your information might 
        end up on one of those computers in another country, and that country 
        may have a different level of data protection regulation than yours. 
        By giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of your 
        information. No matter what country your information is in, we comply 
        with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make 
        in this privacy policy.</p>

      <p>If you are under 13, we don't want your personal information, and you 
        must not provide it to us. If you are a parent and believe that your 
        child who is under 13 has provided us with personal information, please 
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/policies/firefox-os/#top">contact us</a> 
        to have your child's information removed.</p>

      <h2>What if we change this policy?</h2>
      <p>We may need to change this policy and when we do, we'll notify you.</p>
