            <h1>Privacy policy</h1>


            This Privacy Policy governs our policies and practices with respect to the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") and other data that is collected by Webfluential. ("Webfluential", "we", "us" and/or "our") in connection with our website, located at https://webfluential.com (the "Site") and our mobile applications and related services (together with the Site, the "Service(s)").
            <br><br>
            By using our Services you are consenting to our processing of your Personal Information and data as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended. As used herein, "processing" means using or accessing information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, combining and disclosing information. Our servers are located in the Cape Town South Africa. Accordingly, if you reside outside the South Africa, by using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Information will be transferred to South Africa, and processed and stored in the South Africa. By using our Services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.
            <br><br>
            Information Collection and Use.
            <br>
            <h3>How Webfluential Works.</h3>

            Our Service analyzes data that is made available publicly through the Internet in order to measure influence and create a score for Internet users, including, but not limited to, our registered users. Webfluential presents some of this data on the Site and our mobile application(s), such data may also be available on other websites and Webfluential may share this data with our third party partners (as described in more detail below). Webfluential analyses non-public data from private networks (in other words, networks that are password-protected) only when you authorize us to access such data.
            <br>
            <h3>Opting Out.</h3>
            If you are a current user of Webfluential, you can opt-out by logging into your account, navigating to 'settings',then by clicking the 'Disable Account' button. If you confirm your account will become inactive in the form of keeping only your user information in a dormant state and permanently deleting any social media data associated with your account (including access tokens).

            <h3>Information Collected Upon Registration.</h3>

            If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Services and/or to have access to or use of certain parts of the Services, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain Personal Information to Webfluential. Personal Information that we may collect in such instances may include your full user name, password, email address, city, telephone number, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in your public profile.
            With respect to the Webfluential Service specifically, providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find opportunities within the system.

            <h3>Geo-location Data.</h3>

            Webfluential receives location information from the Social Media Services (as defined below) that you enable within the Services.
            We use Geo-location Data to:
            complete your profile (for example, to indicate where you are located);

            <h3>Log Data.</h3>

            When you interact with the Site or use our Services, our servers automatically receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information ("Log Data"). This Log Data is collected passively and may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the Site pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider, the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to provide you with the Services (for example, to provide push notifications on your mobile device) and pool it with other information to monitor the use of the Services, and for the technical administration of the Services. We do not associate your IP address with any other Personal Information to identify you personally, except in cases where we are asked to comply with a subpoena or other legal demand or where we suspect that there has been a violation of our policies, our Terms of Service and/or applicable law.
            <br><br>
            Webfluential uses the Personal Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. We will use your Personal Information in order to provide you with access to and use of our Services, to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services and to better understand our users. If you contact us by email through the Services, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you. In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about our products and services and the products and services of our partners that we believe may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such marketing information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.
            <br><br>
            In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of our Services, Webfluential also often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Information and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Webfluential may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents, advertisers and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Webfluential will also disclose influencer statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes including providing influencer profiles and scores as well as advertising use cases to actual or potential advertisers.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure.</h3>

            We consider your information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below.

            <h3>Service Providers.</h3>

            We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your Personal Information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services.



<!--            <h3>Partners.</h3>-->
<!---->
<!--            From time to time, Webfluential may partner with third parties to improve your experience. For example, with respect to the Service, Webfluential may offer rewards or "Perks" for third party products and services, which may be redeemed by you based on your Score. To redeem certain Perks, our partners may request that you provide Personal Information to them directly; please be aware that the privacy policy of such partners will govern their use of your-->

            <h3>Personal Information.</h3>

            Furthermore, in connection with the operation, promotion, advertising or marketing of our Services, we may provide certain of our partners (e.g., special reward providers; etc.) with Personal Information (e.g., your name or webfluential username) and other content or information related to you (e.g., your profile picture or Score, etc.), or provide certain of our partners with access to our application programming interfaces ("APIs") in order to access such information using information (such as Twitter handles) already in their possession.
            Please note: each time we provide any of your Personal Information to our partners, we only provide information to these partners that is publicly available or publicly viewable in your Webfluential profile at the time we provide it.

            <h3>Social Media Services.</h3>

            You can choose to access certain third party social media Web sites and services through our Services (such as Twitter or Instagram) ("Social Media Services"). When you do so, you are sharing information with those Social Media Services, and the information you share will be governed by their privacy policies and terms of service. You may also be able to modify your privacy settings with these Social Media Services to, for example, control what information the Social Media Services disclose to third parties like Webfluential. When you add Social Media Service accounts to the Services or log into the Services using your Social Media Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable our Services to access that Social Media Service, but you will provide your login information, like your password, directly to such Social Media Service (and not to Webfluential). As part of such integration, the Social Media Service will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to such Social Media Service, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and, if and to the extent applicable, the policies of such Social Media Services. In addition, we may provide certain information about you or your activities on the Services, or that you have otherwise provided to us, to such Social Media Services as part of such integration
            However, please remember that the manner in which Social Media Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such third parties, and Webfluenital shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Social Media Services that may be enabled within the Service. Specifically, with Facebook, the Services utilize the following data and permissions: the ability to access your data “offline”, your email address, to read your stream or feed, likes, birthdate, education, location, work history, and hometown.
            Business Transfers.
            <br><br>
            Webfluential may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.

            <h3>Disclosures for Legal Purposes.</h3>
            Webfluential may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Webfluential, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
            Security.
            <br><br>
            Webfluential is very concerned about the security of your Personal Information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored Personal Information to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
            Links to Other Websites.
            <br><br>
            Our Services may contain links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personally identifiable information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

            <h3>Our Policy Towards Children.</h3>

            If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without his/her consent, he or she should contact us at hello@webfluential.com . We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information via the Services without their permission.

            <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy.</h3>

            The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary to make changes to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may be updated or modified from time to time for any reason without prior notice. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site or by emailing you. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
            <h3>Other Terms and Conditions.</h3>

            Your access to and use of the Services is subject to the Terms and conditions at http://webfluential.com
