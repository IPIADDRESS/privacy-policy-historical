<b>WebcamNow.com Inc. (hereinafter referred to as "WebcamNow") is committed to protecting your privacy. We understand that both personal and financial information is especially sensitive and that you may have concerns about sharing other personal information with us as well. We believe you should control the amount of information we receive about you. Where possible, we allow you to give as much or as little personal information to us as you feel comfortable providing.
</b><br><br>
WebcamNow hopes that you will want to provide information about yourself to us, because it will make your experience here more valuable to you. If you are comfortable sharing some basic information, you may receive enhanced services that are not offered to unregistered visitors to our website.
<br><br>
However you choose to interact with WebcamNow, you have our pledge to protect your privacy.
<br><br>

<b>Signing up with WebcamNow</b>
<br>

To set up a basic WebcamNow account, you are asked to provide an ID name/member name, password, your first and last names, email address, mailing address, zip code, country, and birthdate. When you create a WebcamNow account, we use information you provide to deliver personalized services, including customized product offerings, information, and special offers. Registration is free. 
<br><br>
WebcamNow may conduct voluntary surveys from time to time to help us identify customer interests, and to allow for delivery of personalized information that will be most useful to you. Information collected on reader surveys may be shared with third parties to illustrate, on an aggregate basis only, profiles of WebcamNow users, but we will not individually identify you.
The personally identifiable information you provide during membership registration will not be given to third parties without your consent except in the limited circumstances described in the section of this Privacy Policy entitled "<a href="#infoshare">Information Sharing Policy</a>".
<br><br>
<b>WebcamNow's information gathering system</b>
<br><br>
<b>IP Address</b>
<br>
Your IP address is a number that is assigned by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) to your computer to identify its location. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. We also sometimes use IP addresses to communicate with members and subscribers and possibly even ban those members who are not complying with our <a href="/conditions.html">Terms of Service</a>.
<br><br>
Further, we gather traffic patterns and site usage information such as browser type, referring URL (if any), and your IP address, to help us develop the design and layout of the site and to personalize your WebcamNow experience. This information is not linked to any personally identifiable information about you. 

<br><br>
<b>Cookies</b>
<br>
As a standard practice, WebcamNow assigns a random number to each user to anonymously track content preferences and traffic patterns. This random number lets us keep track -- on an aggregate basis -- of how many times customers are doing specific things, like visiting our site each month, without specifically knowing who those customers are. This random number is kept in a file on your computer and is called a "cookie."
<br><br>
Cookies are small packets of information that a site's computer stores on your computer. They are used on the WebcamNow website to "remember" your password and preferences so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.
<br><br>
These cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the identity of any user. Unless you specifically tell us, WebcamNow will not know who you are. In some cases and from time to time, WebcamNow may have arrangements with third parties who provide or track usage of sponsored links that we believe may be of value to our customers. WebcamNow does not permit these third parties to collect personal information from our customers without the customers' explicit permission.
<br><br>

<b>How WebcamNow Uses Your Information</b>
<br>
WebcamNow is always trying to provide you with a compelling reason to return to our site. We monitor customer traffic patterns and try to analyze what our customers like and don't like about our current offerings, so that we can design better services for you.
<br><br>
The personally identifiable information that you provide to us may be used to process your order (if any) and to offer you a customized and valuable user experience, such as personalized special offers and relevant information, products, and services.

<br><br>
We may share aggregate statistical information regarding our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and site usage with potential partners. For example, we may develop summary, not individual, reports for potential advertisers or sponsors. We never tell our partners who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements, unless you have specifically told us this is acceptable. We also may use this information in conjunction with generally available marketing databases so that we better understand our customers and can tailor our products, services and content to meet our customers' needs and preferences. This information is for Webcamow's use only and is never shared with third parties.
<br><br>
WebcamNow does, from time to time, contract with vendors to provide specific services to WebcamNow, such as data analysis, data storage, email processing, customer service, sweepstakes or promotion fulfillment. We will require our vendors to adhere to WebcamNow's confidentiality standards and to destroy any customer data in their possession once the services are completed.
<br><br>
Except as explained in this policy, WebcamNow will not share your personal information with any third party without first receiving your permission, unless we believe in good faith that the law or professional duty requires it.  See <a href="#infoshare">Information Sharing Policy</a>.
Please remember that any information you disclose in a "Friends &amp; Family" or "Public" Community becomes public information and is immediately accessible on WebcamNow, so it is important for you to exercise discretion and appropriate caution when deciding to reveal personal information in these areas. We therefore encourage you to use care in protecting your identity when you choose a member name and to keep your member name as well as your password confidential. 
We encourage WebcamNow members to update and edit their personal information and keep it current.  You can correct or update personal information at any time after logging into "My Settings" on our home page.
<br><br>

<b>Security Technology (for Speedster service)</b>
<br><br>
<b>What is Speedster?</b>
<br>

WebcamNow allows its users to experience live webcam video with a refresh rate of approximately 1 frame every 10 seconds. To experience faster video speed, users may subscribe to Speedster, a service of WebcamNow. With Speedster, users can view all of the live cams at up to 10-times faster video speed for $9.95 per month.
<br><br>
When you sign up for our Speedster service, we use state-of-the-art technology to protect your data from unauthorized third parties. When WebcamNow processes your order for the Speedster service, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to protect your data and secure your transactions. SSL encrypts all your personal information, including your credit card number, name and address as it is transmitted over the Internet. 
<br><br>
<b>Using a Secure Server</b>
<br>
A secure server safeguards "shopping" transactions over the Internet by encoding information passing between computers at different locations. Using our secure server means that your credit card number, name, address, and other information is guarded as it travels to our store. This is accomplished using a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
<br><br>
<b>Standard Server</b>
<br>
Some older browsers are incompatible with secure servers. If you try to use our secure server and get an error message, you can use our standard server instead. A standard server transports information without encoding it first. 
<br><br>
<b>Cancelling Speedster Service</b>
<br>

To cancel Speedster service, simply log into your account by going to <a href="/login.html">My Settings</a>.  There, you will find a button labeled "Speedster Settings" that will offer the option to cancel your account.
<br><br>

<b>Your Consent</b>
<br>
By using our Website, you consent to the collection and use of the information you provide to us. If we ever change our privacy policy, we will post any changes on this page so that you are always aware of the information that we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
<br><br>

<b>Guidelines Regarding Children</b>
<br>
Personal information about children is a concern for all of us. At WebcamNow, we take the protection of children's privacy very seriously. WebcamNow does not encourage participation or visitation by children. Visitors who are known to be under the age of 13 are prohibited from becoming a member and if it comes to WebcamNow's attention through reliable means that a registered user is a child under 13 years of age, WebcamNow will cancel that user's account immediately.  Visitors who are known to be under the age of 18 are prohibited from accessing the "Public" Community.  A visitor who is known to be under the age of 18 may only access the "Friends &amp; Family" Community and may do so only with parental or guardian consent, as per the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").  Parents or guardians of users under 18 have the right to review their child's personal information at any time and may delete said information if so requested (email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@webcamnow.com">privacy@webcamnow.com</a> with further questions about COPPA and your rights, or visit <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm</a>).  Anyone under the age of eighteen is discouraged from participating in any sex related chats, must adhere to the Terms of Service (link) and we ask that no one less than eighteen years of age become a community volunteer.

<br><br>

<a name="infoshare"><b>Information Sharing Policy</b></a>
<br>
WebcamNow does not sell or otherwise share personally identifiable information with third parties without your consent except in the following instances: (i) we have your consent to share the information; (ii) unless required by applicable law or pursuant to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; (iii) as deemed necessary, in WebcamNow's discretion, to protect the legal rights or the property of WebcamNow, a member or third party, or to prevent personal injury; and/or (iv) in the event WebcamNow is required to transfer personally identifiable information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger, assignment, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock of WebcamNow or its affiliated entities (including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). 
<br><br>
In addition, WebcamNow reserves the right to allow access to its systems to third parties providing necessary technical services when such access is required in order to provide those services and to provide your personally identifiable information to third parties who provide services on behalf of WebcamNow, provided that such third parties are bound by WebcamNow's Privacy Policy. Please note, however, that WebcamNow reserves the right to share any personally identifiable or other information about you which you provide to (or which is gathered by) WebcamNow with any or all of its subsidiaries and affiliates and will also have access to any such information which you provide to (or which is gathered by) the web sites of any WebcamNow subsidiary or affiliate.
