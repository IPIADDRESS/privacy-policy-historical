    <br><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">

    </font></p><p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">At WebRing, we respect your privacy whether you're a first-time Visitor or a dedicated
    Member. We do collect information from you, but our policy is to ensure that all personal
    information remains private to the extent that Members and Visitors wish it to remain private.
    To earn your trust and confidence in the Internet and in WebRing, we are disclosing our privacy
    practices and the uses of the information we gather.</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">To protect your privacy, WebRing:</font>
    </p><ul>
      <li><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">Provides a notice and a link to this Privacy
      Notice on all pages where we collect personal identifying information.</font></li><br><br>
      <li><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">Will use personal identifying information about
      you in a manner consistent with this Privacy Notice.</font></li><br><br>
      <li><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">Will not knowingly collect personal identifying
      information from children under 13 or knowingly use such information without express parental
      consent.</font></li>
    </ul><p></p>

    <p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">As you may know, WebRing serves as an Internet
    navigation and linking service, allowing people to find out information about topics of
    interest and to link with others having interest in similar topics. WebRing does not operate
    or control the individual Web sites which are part of WebRings. RingMasters and Ring Members
    may be Members of or subscribers to other Internet services which have their own privacy and
    content guidelines or restrictions. WebRing does not control what appears on the Web sites
    contained in Rings.</font></p>

    <p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
    A. WEBRING'S COLLECTION AND USE OF GENERAL INFORMATION FROM MEMBERS AND VISITORS</strong></font></p>

    <p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">WebRing collects information from all Visitors to
    our site, including IP address, operating system, and browser software. Using your IP address,
    we can determine your Internet Service Provider and your geographic location. This information
    reflects the population as a whole rather than focusing on individuals, and we use it to
    identify the most popular Rings, portals and other areas on our Web site and evaluate the
    effectiveness of our promotional activities.</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">We also use this information to perform statistical
    analyses of collective characteristics and behavior, so we can measure overall Visitor
    demographics and interests regarding the Site. For example, we disclose the aggregate data
    to advertisers to inform them of the number (and characteristics) of people who have seen
    and clicked on their advertisements.</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">WebRing does not collect the e-mail addresses of
    people who communicate with us via e-mail; we use the addresses only to respond to them.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
    B. WEBRING'S COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION FROM ITS MEMBERS AND VISITORS</strong></font><p></p>

    <p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">Personal identifying information includes: </font>
    </p><ul>
      <li><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">Home or other physical address</font></li><br><br>
      <li><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">Phone number</font></li><br><br>
      <li><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">Any other information that identifies a specific
      individual</font></li><br><br>
      <li><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">Any information which, when tied to the above listed
      specific information, can identify a specific individual.</font></li>
    </ul>

    <p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">The only personal identifying information we currently
    collect is the first and last name and e-mail address of RingMasters and Ring Members. We
    collect this information at various locations throughout the site, including Create a New
    Ring and Join an Existing Ring processes. We give notice at each location that asks for
    personal identifying information, and such information will be used only for the purposes
    stated at the location of the collection, and/or within this Privacy Statement. When we
    collect personal identifying information, you will always have the choice of whether or
    not to provide it. However, you may not be able to receive certain of WebRing?s services
    without providing the information requested.</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">We use this information for administrative and other
    purposes that we believe are necessary to maintain, improve and enhance our services. Such
    uses include data transmission, surveys of our Members conducted by third parties, sending
    e-mail messages to all of our Members. We may use third parties to provide these services.
    </font></p>

    <p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">WebRing fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies
    in identifying those persons who use our services for illegal activities, and we reserve the
    right to release personal identifying information about Members when we believe our
    services are being used unlawfully even without a subpoena, warrant or court order.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">We do not control the actions of our Members or
    Visitors. If you disclose personal information on your Ring or to others, it may be collected
    and used by others. WebRing does not assume any responsibility for actions of those other
    parties. </font></p>

    <p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">When you join a Ring, personal identifying information
    is also collected by the RingMaster. RingMasters are independent of WebRing, and are only
    permitted to use the information collected in order to administer the Ring, and to send
    messages to Ring Members. If you believe that any RingMaster is misusing personal
    identifying information please contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@webring.org">privacy@webring.org</a>.

    <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
    C. WEBRING DOES NOT KNOWINGLY COLLECT INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN</strong></font><p></p>

    <p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">We believe that it is especially important to protect
    children's privacy online. </font></p>

    <p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">Note: WebRing defines children as minors under the age
    of 13 years.</font></p>

    information WebRing maintains about you, or change or delete any information within WebRing's
    active database please direct your browser to
    <a href="http://www.webring.org/manage.html">Ring Management</a></font></p>

    <p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">If you leave WebRing, we may delete your information
    from our active database. Residual information will remain within our archived database and
    records.</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica">WebRing does not control the acts of its RingMasters
    or Members. All RingMasters, Members and Visitors should be aware that, when they disclose
    personal identifying information to others, the information may be collected and used by
    others to send that person unsolicited e-mail from other parties, outside WebRing. If you
    encounter any WebRing Member or RingMaster who is improperly collecting or using
    information about users, please contact: <a href="mailto:privacy@webring.org">privacy@webring.org</a></font></p>
