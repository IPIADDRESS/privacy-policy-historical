    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>WebRing and the Privacy of our Visitors and Members</strong></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At WebRing, we respect your privacy whether you're a

    first-time visitor or a dedicated member. We do collect information from you, but our

    policy is to ensure that all personal information remains private to the extent that

    members and visitors wish it to remain private. To earn your trust and confidence in the

    Internet and in WebRing, we are disclosing our privacy practices and the uses of the

    information we gather.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To protect your privacy, WebRing:</font></p><ul>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Provides a notice and a link to this Privacy Notice on all

        pages where we collect personal identifying information.<br>

        <br>

        </font></li>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Will use personal identifying information about you in a

        manner consistent with this Privacy Notice.<br>

        <br>

        </font></li>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Will not knowingly collect personal identifying information

        from children under 13 or knowingly use such information without express parental consent.</font></li>

    </ul>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As you may know, WebRing serves as an Internet navigation

    and linking service, allowing people to find out information about topics of interest and

    to link with others having interest in similar topics. WebRing does not operate or control

    the individual Web sites which are part of WebRings. RingMasters and ring members may be

    members of or subscribers to other Internet services which have their own privacy and

    content guidelines or restrictions. WebRing does not control what appears on the Web sites

    contained in rings.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Notice,

    please contact us at:<a href="mailto:privacy@webring.org">privacy@webring.org</a></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>A. WEBRING'S COLLECTION AND USE OF GENERAL

    INFORMATION FROM MEMBERS AND VISITORS</strong></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">WebRing collects information from all visitors to our site,

    including IP address, operating system, and browser software. Using your IP address, we

    can determine your Internet Service Provider and your geographic location. This

    information reflects the population as a whole rather than focusing on individuals, and we

    use it to identify the most popular rings, portals and other areas on our Web site and

    evaluate the effectiveness of our promotional activities.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We also use this information to perform statistical

    analyses of collective characteristics and behavior, so we can measure overall visitor

    demographics and interests regarding the Site. For example, we disclose the aggregate data

    to advertisers to inform them of the number (and characteristics) of people who have seen

    and clicked on their advertisements.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">WebRing does not collect the e-mail addresses of people who

    communicate with us via e-mail; we use the addresses only to respond to them.</font></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>B. WEBRING'S COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL

    IDENTIFYING INFORMATION FROM ITS MEMBERS AND VISITORS</strong></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Personal identifying information includes: </font></p><ul>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Home or other physical address; <br>

        <br>

        </font></li>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Phone number;<br>

        <br>

        </font></li>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Any other information that identifies a specific individual;<br>

        <br>

        </font></li>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Any information which, when tied to the above listed

        specific information, can identify a specific individual;</font></li>

    </ul>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The only personal identifying information we currently

    collect is the first and last name and e-mail address of RingMasters and ring members. We

    collect this information at various locations throughout the site, including Create a New

    Ring and Join an Existing Ring processes. We give notice at each location that asks for

    personal identifying information, and such information will be used only for the purposes

    stated at the location of the collection, and/or within this Privacy Statement. When we

    collect personal identifying information, you will always have the choice of whether or

    not to provide it. However, you may not be able to receive certain of WebRing?s services

    without providing the information requested.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We use this information for administrative and other

    purposes that we believe are necessary to maintain, improve and enhance our services. Such

    uses include data transmission, surveys of our members conducted by third parties, sending

    e-mail messages to all of our members. We may use third parties to provide these services.

    </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">WebRing fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in

    identifying those persons who use our services for illegal activities, and we reserve the

    right to release personal identifying information about members when we believe our

    services are being used unlawfully even without a subpoena, warrant or court order.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We do not control the actions of our members or visitors.

    If you disclose personal information on your ring or to others, it may be collected and

    used by others. WebRing does not assume any responsibility for actions of those other

    parties. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When you join a ring, personal identifying information is

    also collected by the RingMaster. RingMasters are independent of WebRing, and are only

    permitted to use the information collected in order to administer the ring, and to send

    messages to ring members. If you believe that any RingMaster is misusing personal

    identifying information please contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@webring.org">privacy@webring.org</a>.

    </font></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">C. WEBRING DOES NOT KNOWINGLY COLLECT INFORMATION

    FROM CHILDREN</font></strong></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We believe that it is especially important to protect

    children's privacy online. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Note: WebRing defines children as minors under the age of

    13 years.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We do not knowingly collect any personal identifying

    information from children. For this reason, children are not knowingly permitted to be

    RingMasters. </font></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">D. MEMBERS? ABILITY TO CHANGE/REMOVE INFORMATION</font></strong></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If, at any time you would like to find out the information

    WebRing maintains about you, or change or delete any information within WebRing's active

    database please direct your browser to Ring Management at: <u><a href="http://www.webring.org/manage.html">http://www.webring.org/manage.html</a></u></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you leave WebRing, we may delete your information from

    our active database. Residual information will remain within our archived database and

    records.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">WebRing does not control the acts of its RingMasters or

    members. All RingMasters, members and visitors should be aware that, when they disclose

    personal identifying information to others, the information may be collected and used by

    others to send that person unsolicited e-mail from other parties, outside WebRing. If you

    encounter any WebRing member or RingMaster who is improperly collecting or using

    information about users, please contact: <a href="mailto:privacy@webring.org">privacy@webring.org</a></font></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">E. SECURITY OF INFORMATION COLLECTED BY WEBRING</font></strong></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Information collected by WebRing is stored on secure

    servers and access is limited to authorized personnel only.</font></p>

    <p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">F. OUTSIDE PARTY COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION</font></strong></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Please be aware that WebRing does not control the acts of

    its members or visitors. All members and visitors should be aware that, when they disclose

    personal information, on their Web site or elsewhere on the site, the information might be

    collected and used by others. Additionally, members should be aware that when they link,

    or click on ad banners, they might go to other sites not operated by WebRing. These

    outside parties may have different privacy policies from those of WebRing. If you are

    asked to divulge personal identifying information at any point outside WebRing, please be

    aware that privacy policies other than webring may apply to the collection and use of that

    information. WebRing does not control and does not assume any responsibility for any

    actions of third parties.</font></p>
