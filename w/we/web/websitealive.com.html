                  <p><strong> Our Basic Privacy Policy</strong> </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our 
                      commitment to combine the highest-quality products and services 
                      with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our 
                      clients and partners. The Policy is designed to assist you 
                      in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal 
                      information you provide to us and to assist you in making 
                      informed decisions when using our site and our products 
                      and services. This statement will be continuously assessed 
                      against new technologies, business practices and our customers' 
                      needs.</p>
                    <p>What Information Do We Collect? When you visit our Web 
                      site you may provide us with two types of information: personal 
                      information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected 
                      on an individual basis and Web site use information collected 
                      on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p><strong>1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide</strong></p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>Credit Card Information. If you choose to purchase products 
                      or services from us or our partners, you may need to give 
                      personal information and authorization to obtain information 
                      from various credit services. For example, you may need 
                      to provide the following information: </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Name</li>
                      <li>Mailing Address </li>
                      <li>E-Mail Address </li>
                      <li>Credit Card Number </li>
                      <li>Home and Busines Phone Number </li>
                      <li>Other Personal Information (i.e. Mother's Maiden Name) 
                      </li>
                      <li>E-Mail Information. In addition to providing the foregoing 
                        information to our partners, if you choose to correspond 
                        further with us through email, we may retain the content 
                        of your email messages together with your email address 
                        and our responses. We provide the same protections for 
                        these electronic communications that we employ in the 
                        maintenance of information received by mail and telephone. 
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p><strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong></p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes 
                      a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation 
                      below, "What Are Cookies?") and Web server logs 
                      to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information 
                      gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include 
                      the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent 
                      at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and 
                      just after our Web site. This information is collected on 
                      an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated 
                      with you as an individual.</p>
                    <p>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us? Broadly 
                      speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering 
                      our business activities, providing customer service and 
                      making available other products and services to our customers 
                      and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use 
                      the information we collect to notify you about important 
                      changes to our Web site, new services and special offers 
                      we think you will find valuable. The lists used to send 
                      you product and service offers are developed and managed 
                      under our traditional corporate standards designed to safeguard 
                      the security and privacy of our customers' personal information. 
                      As a customer, you will be given the opportunity, at least 
                      once annually, to notify us of your desire not to receive 
                      these offers.</p>
                    <p>What Are Cookies? Cookies are a feature of Web browser 
                      software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer 
                      used to access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data 
                      that are stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard 
                      drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses 
                      on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with 
                      that Web site by the same user or to use the information 
                      to streamline the user's transactions on related Web pages. 
                      This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to 
                      Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the 
                      Internet.</p>
                    <p>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies? We use 
                      Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web 
                      server logs to gather information about our Web site users' 
                      browsing activities, in order to constantly improve our 
                      Web site and better serve our customers. This information 
                      assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the most 
                      user-friendly manner and to continually improve our Web 
                      site to better meet the needs of our customers and prospective 
                      customers. Cookies are also used within our AliveChat application 
                      to help identify return visitors, and gather user information 
                      which is useful to the operator.</p>
                    <p>Cookies help us collect important business and technical 
                      statistics. The information in the cookies lets us trace 
                      the paths followed by users to our Web site as they move 
                      from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count 
                      how many people visit our Web site and evaluate our Web 
                      site's visitor capacity. We do not use these technologies 
                      to capture your individual email address or any personally 
                      identifying information about you although they do permit 
                      us to send focused online banner advertisements or other 
                      such responses to you.</p>
                    <p>How Do We Secure Information Transmissions? When you send 
                      confidential personal credit card information to us on our 
                      Web site, a secure server software which we have licensed 
                      encrypts all information you input before it is sent to 
                      us. The information is scrambled en route and decoded once 
                      it reaches our Web site.</p>
                    <p>Other email that you may send to us may not be secure unless 
                      we advise you that security measures will be in place prior 
                      to your transmitting the information. For that reason, we 
                      ask that you do not send confidential information such as 
                      Social Security or account numbers to us through an unsecured 
                      email.</p>
                    <p>How Do We Protect Your Information? Information Security. 
                      We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the 
                      confidentiality of personal information and passwords we 
                      collect from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental 
                      loss, alteration or destruction.</p>
                    <p>Evaluation of Information Protection Practices. Periodically, 
                      our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance 
                      with corporate policies and procedures governing the security, 
                      confidentiality and quality of our information.</p>
                    <p>Employee Access, Training and Expectations. Our corporate 
                      values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed 
                      to the protection of customer information. In general, our 
                      business practices limit employee access to confidential 
                      information, and limit the use and disclosure of such information 
                      to authorized persons, processes and transactions.</p>
                    <p>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information? You may 
                      request access to all your personally identifiable information 
                      that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing 
                      techsupport@websitealive.com.</p>
                    <p>Do We Disclose Information to Outside Parties? We do not 
                      provide aggregate information about our customers, sales, 
                      Web site traffic patterns and related Web site information 
                      to our affiliates or reputable third parties; this information 
                      includes personally identifying data, except as otherwise 
                      provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?<br>
                      We may disclose information when legally compelled to do 
                      so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that 
                      the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights.</p>
                    <p>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site? We are 
                      not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites 
                      linked to or from our Web site nor the information or content 
                      contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided 
                      solely as pointers to information on topics that may be 
                      useful to the users of our Web site.</p>
                    <p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our 
                      Web site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer 
                      in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other Web 
                      site, including Web sites which have a link on our Web site, 
                      is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please 
                      read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>
                    <p>Your Consent. By using our Web site you consent to our 
                      collection and use of your personal information as described 
                      in this Privacy Policy. If we change our privacy policies 
                      and procedures, we will post those changes on our Web site 
                      to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we 
                      use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.</p>

                      for use of the Pay Services.</p>
                    <p>Confidentiality. Registration Data is the property of WebsiteAlive, 
                      subject to and protected by the Electronic Communications

                      otherwise disclose your Registration Data to any third party. 
                      WebsiteAlive maintains a secured area on the Site for transmission 
                      of Registration Data, and stores all Registration Data in 
                      a private database which is not connected to the Internet.</p>
                    <p> Uses of Registration Data. Unless you select the "Opt-Out" 
                      option as described below, WebsiteAlive reserves the right 
                      to use your Registration Data to send you information about 
                      WebsiteAlive, the Site, WebsiteAlive products and services, 
                      and other topics in which you have indicated an interest.</p>
                    <p>Opt-Out Right. If you do not wish to receive any special 
                      offers or other communications from WebsiteAlive, you have 
                      the right to select the "opt out" option during 
                      the registration process or at any time afterwards. You 
                      may "opt out" by clicking on the box marked "I 
                      DO NOT WISH TO RECEIVE SPECIAL COMMUNICATIONS FROM WebsiteAlive" 
                      when you register for an account or at any time afterwards 
                      by going to the "Special Offers" area of the Site.</p>
                    <p>User Access to Information Collected. You may access your 
                      Registration Data at any time through the Subscriber services 
                      section of the Site. This area is password-restricted for 
                      your protection.</p>
                    <p>Lost or Stolen Information. If your credit card or password 
                      is stolen or used without your permission, immediately notify 
                      WebsiteAlive. Upon notification WebsiteAlive will cancel your 
                      credit card number and/or password and update its records. 
                      You may be unable to access certain services while WebsiteAlive

                    <p>Cancellation. You may cancel your account at any time by 
                      sending an e-mail to newaccounts@websitealive.com. Once 
                      WebsiteAlive has finished processing the cancellation, WebsiteAlive 
                      will delete all your Registration Data from its database. 
                    </p>
                    <p>No Liability for Acts of Third Parties. Although WebsiteAlive 
                      will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality 
                      of the Registration Data, transmissions made by means of

                      will have no liability for disclosure of Registration Data 
                      due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third 
                      parties.</p>
                    <p>Use of Aggregated Information. WebsiteAlive reserves the 
                      right to disclose to third parties information about Subscriber 
                      usage of the WebsiteAlive Web site and any related services, 
                      including information gathered during your use of the Site. 
                      Any information disclosed will be in the form of aggregate 
                      data (such as overall patterns or demographic reports) that 
                      does not describe or identify any individual user.</p>
