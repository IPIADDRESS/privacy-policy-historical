        <p class="Mainbody">Webix™ is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of visitors to our web sites as well as the privacy of our actual customers. </p>
        <p class="Mainbody">For visitors, we've structured our web sites so that, in general, you can visit us on the web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information.</p>
        <p class="Mainbody">For customers, once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your customer relationship with Webix.<br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class="Mainbody"><strong>Visitors to Our Website</strong></p>
        <p class="Mainbody"><br>
        What information do we collect?</p>
        <p class="Mainbody"><br>
        When you visit our web site, our web server collects basic user information about you that includes your ISP's domain, the time you accessed our web site, and the pages from within our web site that you visit.</p>
        <p class="Mainbody"><br>
        We may at times also use cookies, which are small pieces of information that a web site can store in a designated file on your computer. Cookies allow a web application to respond to you as an individual. By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, the web application can tailor its operation to your needs, likes, and dislikes.</p>
        <p class="Mainbody"><br>
        Our web server does not collect your e-mail address or aggregate information on what other pages on the Web you have accessed or visited.</p>
      <p class="Mainbody">How do we use this information?<br>
            <br>
          The basic user information collected is used to help us analyze web traffic and to improve the content of our web site. Cookies may be used to facilitate your customer interaction with us. For example, we may use a cookie on the landing page of products sold online which record the customer information that is required on the order form, and then forward this information to our internal sales tracking database.</p>
        <p class="Mainbody">We may from time to time disclose to third parties aggregate information on our web site's traffic profile. For example, Internet advertising companies may require this data to help us better target our advertisements on our web site(s) and/or other web sites.</p>
        <p class="Mainbody"><br>
          Note that our site provides links to products and services offered by other companies; the company's web site that you link to will be able to determine that you linked from our web site.<br>

        What information do we collect?</p>
        <p class="Mainbody"><br>
        When you sign up for Webix's services, you provide us with both contact and payment information. Contact information typically includes your name, address, and phone number. Payment information typically includes your billing information and/or credit card number.</p>
        <p class="Mainbody">While you are a Webix customer, we manage information with regard to your account status, choice of services, and customer logs. In addition, we may store customers' electronic mail and other communications as a necessary incident to the transmission and delivery of those communications.</p>
        <p class="Mainbody"><br>
        How do we use this information?</p>
        <p class="Mainbody"><br>
        We use the contact information you provide us to establish our service for you. We use payment information for payment processing purposes only. We create and maintain other information such as customer account status, choice of services, and customer logs in the normal course of providing service.</p>
        <p class="Mainbody"><br>
        Webix may share customer information with selected partners/third parties, for example, to provide you with information about products which might be of interest to you or to enable you to take advantage of special partner programs. Webix may also use customer information to provide customers with system information or information about new or upgraded products.</p>
        <p class="Mainbody"><br>
        We will not otherwise disclose customer personal and account information unless we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of Webix, our customers, or others, or where Webix has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure.</p>
        <p class="Mainbody"><br>
        Webix also will not, except for reasons stated below, disclose to third parties the contents of any electronic mail or other electronic communications that Webix stores or transmits for its customers. The circumstances under which Webix will disclose such electronic customer communications are when:</p>
        <p class="Mainbody"><br>
          1. It is necessary in order to provide service to the customer;<br>
          2. It is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Webix and its customers;<br>
          3. It is required to cooperate with interception orders, warrants, or other legal process that Webix determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable; and<br>
          4. It is necessary to provide to a law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently obtained by Webix and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime.</p>
        <p class="Mainbody"><br>
        Webix disclaims any intention to censor, edit, or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by customers or others. Webix will, however, review, delete, or block access to communications that may harm Webix, its customers or third parties. The grounds on which Webix may take such action include, but are not limited to, actual or potential violations of Webix's Terms of Use.</p>
        <p class="Mainbody"><br>
        Customers may opt out of receiving newsletters and/or notices of new or upgraded products from Webix by submitting a request. In this request, customers must identify their domain name and contact information.</p>
        <p class="Mainbody"><br>
        Please note, however, that Webix reserves the right to send bulletins and other important information regarding our services at our discretion.</p>
