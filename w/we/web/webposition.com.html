<p>In general, you can browse the <a href="http://www.webposition.com/">www.webposition.com</a> web site (the “Site”) without providing us any personal information. Ordering software products or services, requesting support and other activities on the Site may require you to be registered or provide us with some personal information -- for example, to download a trial of the software or services we make available on the Site. </p>
<p>Please note that this policy only applies to our data collection and use practices for the Site and does not apply to the data collection and use practices of other companies or organizations whose products, services or Web sites you may use or gain access to through the Site. For information on the data collection and use practices of those third parties, please refer to their respective policies and procedures. </p>
<p>

</p><p><strong>Types of Information We Collect and Use</strong></p>
<p>In general, we collect and use both anonymous and personal user information and access and use data. We collect this information and data from a variety of sources, including access and use of the Site, and user registrations, transactions and correspondence. </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Anonymous User Information.</strong> When you visit the Site, our servers record the information that your browser automatically sends whenever visiting a web site, including your web request, the Internet Protocol address and browser configuration of your computer, the date and time of your request, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the referring and exiting Web sites, and we place one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We generally collect this anonymous (i.e. non-personally identifying) in server log files and use this information for a variety of purposes, including the administration and operation of our Web sites and other properties, identifying and preventing fraud and misuse of our Web sites, designing and developing new products and services and generally improving the overall quality of your experience.</li>
	<li><strong>Personal User Information.</strong> In addition to the anonymous user information above, we may occasionally request from you or you may otherwise voluntarily provide us information that personally identifies you. We receive personal user information when you register on the Site, when you place an order for the software products, services and support we make available on the Site, and from other user requests and correspondence.  Depending on the activity, the personal information we collect may include contact information (such as first and last name, mailing address, email address and telephone number), demographic information (such as age, gender, occupation and household income) and billing information (shipping and billing address, credit card information). Specifically, as part of the registration process we collect some personal information and use that information for several purposes, including to enable us to properly identify you, provide you with our products and services, tell you about products, seminars and services if you so request, fulfill your requests, contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information or regarding customer satisfaction surveys. To place and fulfill online orders for software products, services and support, we may require you to enter personal information, including credit card information and a shipping and/or mailing address. If you subscribe to our newsletter, we ask you to provide your business email address. In general, when we request personal information from you, we will inform you of the type of information we need and the purpose of our use. Except as specifically described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use your personal information for the purpose it was collected.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Site, one or more cookies, web beacons or action tags may be sent to your computer or otherwise used in connection with your visit or use. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your computer when you visit a Web site or use a service. When stored on your computer, a cookie uniquely identifies your browser and records your preferences and other data about your visit or use. Cookies are also sometimes used to complete transactions requested by users. Web beacons, also known as web bugs, are small, graphic images that transparently reside on a Web site or other web-based service and are designed to allow the Web site or service owner to monitor who is visiting the Web site or using the service. Action tags assist in delivering cookies and embed a random identifying number on a user's browser.  We use information collected from cookies and web beacons to track which pages our users view, which browsers they use and other information about user activity when visiting the Site or using our products and services. We may also use cookies to help us provide you with personalized features and preferences in a manner that is linked to personal user information you elect to share with us. We use action tags to compile statistics and other data about our users on an aggregate basis.  </p>
<p>We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For a session cookie, once you close your browser the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie stays stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can change the settings on your browser to refuse or notify you prior to accepting cookies and to remove them from your computer. However, some features, products and services may not function properly without cookies. </p>
<p>We may engage third party advertisement networks that may place cookies on computers accessing and using the Site that collect non-personal information regarding the content accessed by the computer on the Site.  This information may be used by InfoSpace and its third party advertising network partners to identify and target related advertising to the user of such computer, when on Web sites within the third party’s advertising network of sites.  Some of these third party advertising networks may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and subject to the NAI Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Preference Marketing by Network Advertisers, available at www.networkadvertising.org (the "NAI Principles"). If you would like to opt-out from these services, you may go to the NAI Non-PII Opt-Out Page, located at http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, or the opt-out page of the particular third party advertising network identified in the cookie.  In addition, these companies may offer you a way to directly opt out of ad targeting based on their cookies by visiting their Web sites and following their opt out procedures.</p>

<p><strong>How We Use Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>In general, we only use your personal information for the purpose it was collected, including internally to serve you the Web sites, products and services you request, to enhance and extend our relationship with you, and to improve our products and services. We also use personal information for fulfillment and billing purposes, to complete transactions you have requested, to anticipate and resolve problems with our products and services, to respond to customer support inquiries, to create and inform you of new products and services, and to comply with applicable laws. </p>

<p><strong>Inter-Company Transfers</strong></p>
<p>We may internally transfer the information we collect, including your personal information, to and from the United States and any other country in which we or our agents maintain facilities for the purposes identified above, as well as for storage, processing or other business use as permitted under this Privacy Policy. The data protection laws in these countries may be more or less extensive than laws in the country in which you reside. By accessing or using the Site you consent to the transfer of your personal information among these facilities, including those located outside of your country of residence.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing Information With Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>In general, we do not sell, rent or otherwise trade your personal information with third parties. However, we may disclose and share your personal information with third parties under the following limited circumstances:
</p><ul>
	<li>Consent. We have received your consent or permission.</li>
	<li>Transaction Processing. As necessary to complete a requested transaction, such as verification of your credit card information. In some instances we rely on channel partners and third party vendors to fulfill transactions, product trials and information requests, and provide customers and prospective customers with information about our products and services. To do this, such channel partners or third party vendors may collect or we may transfer to them your information solely for that purpose, in which case they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. </li>
	<li>Third Party Service Providers. Occasionally, we engage third parties to provide us with certain products and services, such as support, consulting, statistical analysis and marketing research, packaging, mailing and delivering items, sending postal mail, providing technical support, and processing event registrations that may require access to or use of your personal information. In such event, the third party will be obligated to maintain the privacy of any personal information disclosed or shared as part of its provision to us of the product to service and to only use such information for the limited purpose of providing the product or service. </li>
	<li>Business Transfers. Information about our users and the access and use of the Site and our products and services is one of our most important business assets. As such, information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed and transferred as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide products and services, the sale or pledge of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets.</li>
	<li>Protection of InfoSpace; Compliance with Law. We will disclose personal information or remove, destroy or alter personal information in our possession or control when we believe it is necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, its employees, customers or the public.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>We may use, disclose and share any anonymous, non-personally identifiable information and data we collect with any third party in our sole discretion. </p>

<p><strong>Third Party Information Collection and Use; Links</strong></p>
<p>The Site and our products and services use and provide access to products, services and content of third parties (collectively, "Third Party Properties"). Please be aware that we do not control and are not responsible for the information collection and use practices and policies of these third parties, and that by accessing or using Third Party Properties they may collect information regarding your use and access. In general, clicking on third party links on the Site, whether part of an advertisement or other content, will allow the third party provider of the result, link or content to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information about your browser and activity. We encourage you to be aware when you use a Third Party Property or leave the Site and review any such third party's data and information collection and use practices and policies with regard to their Web site, products or services. </p>

<p><strong>Information Storage and Security</strong></p>
<p>We have implemented and use a variety of industry accepted physical, electronic and managerial policies and procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect to help prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction and to maintain its accuracy and correct use. We generally store the information and data we collect on our own servers in a secure environment and restrict access to your personal information to employees and agents who use that information in order to provide you with access and use of the Site and our products and services, operate and maintain the Site and our distribution network and as otherwise set forth and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. While we have taken efforts to safeguard and secure your personal information, we cannot guarantee that your information may not be disclosed, altered or destroyed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.</p>

<p><strong>Choice</strong></p>
<p>Typically you will have the choice of whether or not to provide us with personal information. However, you may not be able to access or use some features of the Site and some of our other products and services if you chose not to provide us with the information required for those products and services. Unless the cost, burden or expense of such access is unwarranted, or the rights of a third party would be violated, we will provide you with the ability to access, correct, update and/or delete the personal information we collect and store from you by contacting us at the contact information provided below.</p>

<p><strong>Special Notification with respect to Children's Privacy (Users under the Age of 13)</strong></p>
<p>In response to concerns about protecting children's privacy online, Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with InfoSpace policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT:
</p><ul>
	<li>Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable information online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; or</li>
	<li>Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties; It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately delete the information from our servers.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Questions regarding children's privacy should be directed to us at the contact information provided below.</p>

Our privacy practices with respect to personal data collected from individuals residing in the EU are self-certified to the Safe Harbor Program developed by the US Department of Commerce and the European Commission.
