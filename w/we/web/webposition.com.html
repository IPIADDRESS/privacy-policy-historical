		        <p>Please note that this policy only applies to our data collection and use practices 
		        for the Sites and does not apply to the data collection and use practices of other companies or 
		        organizations whose products, services or Web sites you may use or gain access to through the Sites. 
		        For information on the data collection and use practices of those third parties, please refer to their 
		        respective policies and procedures.</p>
		        
		        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Types of Information We Collect and Use</p>
		        <p>In general, you can browse the Sites without providing us any personal information. 
		        Ordering products or services, requesting support and other activities on the Sites may require you to be 
		        registered or provide us with some personal information – for example, to participate in a trial of the 
		        software or services we make available on the Sites, or to post a comment.</p>
		        <p>The information we collect about you generally falls into the following categories: 
		        Personally Identifiable Information (“Personal Information”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information 
		        (“Anonymous Information”).<br></p>
		        <p>Personal Information refers to information that identifies or can be used to identify 
		        the person to whom the information relates, for example your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, 
		        employer and job title.<br></p>
		        <p>Anonymous Information refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific 
		        individual. </p>
		        <p style="font-style: italic;">Personal Information </p>
		        <p>We collect your email address if you communicate with us by email, as well as other 
		        information that you might supply voluntarily, such as through a contact form or a survey.</p>
		        <p>If you purchase Services on the Sites, we collect information such as your name, email 
		        address, and other demographic information (such as age, gender, occupation and household income). In addition, 
		        our secure third party payment processing provider collects credit card and other billing information.</p>
		        <p>Billing is accomplished through the use of a secure and Payment Card Industry Data 
		        Security Standards compliant third party billing services, securing your sensitive financial and billing information. </p>
		        <p>We may use Personal Information to respond to an email or other inquiry or request, 
		        to help improve our Sites or our Services, to customize your experience at the Sites, or to send updates or 
		        notices about our Services or other products that we offer and think may be of interest to you. We may also 
		        combine this information with other generally or publicly available information to help us identify visitors’ 
		        preferences or interests. We may provide information that identifies you to companies that assist us in these 
		        activities, such as helping to fulfill your request for a product, service or information. In addition, we 
		        collect information about keywords for search engine optimization efforts. These keywords are collected and 
		        stored for you, for your own analytical purposes.</p>
		        <p style="font-style: italic">Anonymous Information</p>
		        <p>When you visit our Sites, our servers record the information that your browser 
		        automatically sends whenever visiting a Web site, including your Web request, the Internet Protocol address 
		        and browser configuration of your computer, the date and time of your request, the Uniform Resource Locator 
		        of the referring and exiting Web sites, and we place one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your 
		        browser. We generally collect this Anonymous Information in server log files and use this information for a 
		        variety of purposes, including the administration and operation of our Web sites and other properties, 
		        identifying and preventing fraud and misuse of our Web sites, designing and developing new products and 
		        services and improving the overall quality of your experience.</p>
		        <p style="font-style: italic">Cookies</p>
		        <p>We may automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies” or 
		        clear gifs. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user’s hard drive at the request of a Web site 
		        to enable the Sites to recognize users who have previously visited them and retain certain information such 
		        as customer preferences and history. Clear gifs (also known as web bugs or web beacons) are small, invisible 
		        graphic images that may be used on the Sites or in emails relating to the Sites to collect certain information 
		        and monitor user activity on the Sites. If we combine cookies with or link them to any personally identifiable 
		        information, we treat this information as Personal Information.</p>
		        <p>We use information collected from cookies and clear gifs to track the pages our users 
		        view, the browsers they use and other information about user activity when visiting the Sites or using our 
		        Services. We may also use cookies to help us provide you with personalized features and preferences in a manner 
		        that is linked to personal user information that you voluntarily share with us. We use action tags to compile 
		        statistics and other data about our users on an aggregate basis.</p>
		        <p>We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Sites. These third parties may place 
		        cookies, clear gifs or other devices on your computer to collect Anonymous Information, and information provided 
		        by these devices may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better 
		        understand the usage and visitation of our Sites and the other sites tracked by these third parties. Our Privacy 
		        Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies in third party ads. Please refer to the 
		        advertiser’s privacy policy for information on how such information will be used.</p>
		        <p>You can change the settings on your browser to refuse or notify you prior to accepting 
		        cookies and to remove them from your computer. However, some features, products and services may not function 
		        properly without cookies.</p>
		        <p style="font-style: italic">Information in Public Areas</p>
		        <p>Please keep in mind that if you voluntarily post information or comments in public areas 
		        of the Sites, that information can be viewed and possibly used by others. Do not disclose contact information, 
		        including phone number, email address, street address or any other information that you do not wish to share. We 
		        may edit information that you post to public areas for formatting, size, and/or content. We may also highlight 
		        content that you post to the public areas by featuring your content in a prominent location.</p>
		        
		        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">How We Use Your Personal Information</p>
		        <p>We use your Personal Information for the purpose for which it was collected, 
		        including, but not limited to, internally to serve you the Sites and Services requested by you, to 
		        enhance and extend our relationship with you, and to improve our products and services. We also use 
		        Personal Information for fulfillment and billing purposes, to customize the content that you see, to 
		        complete transactions you have requested, to anticipate and resolve problems with our products and 
		        services, to respond to customer support inquiries, to create and inform you of new products and 
		        services, to prevent illegal activities, and to comply with applicable laws.</p>
		        <p>Personal Information may be linked together or merged with other personal 
		        information so that we may better understand your needs and inform you about our products or services 
		        and those of our partners. </p>
		        <p>We do not sell, lease or rent your information to third parties. By purchasing 
		        the Services, you consent to the use of your email address and other contact data to be kept up to date 
		        on products and services. By providing us with Personal Information, you consent to our processing this 
		        information for the above purposes. You also consent to our transferring this information to countries 
		        or jurisdictions that do not provide the same level of data protection as within the United States, if 
		        necessary, for the above purposes. If we make such transfers, we will make commercially reasonable 
		        efforts to ensure your Personal Information is protected, unless otherwise required by applicable 
		        law or provided for herein.</p>
		        
		        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Sharing and Disclosure</p>
		        <p>The Sites and the Services may use and provide access to products, services 
		        and content of third parties (collectively “Third Party Properties”). Please be aware that we do not 
		        control and are not responsible for the information collection and use practices and policies of these 
		        third parties, and that by accessing or using Third Party Properties, they may collect information 
		        regarding your use and access. In general, clicking on a third party link on the Sites, whether part 
		        of an advertisement or other content, will allow the third party provider of the result, link or content 
		        to collect Anonymous Information about your browser and activity. We encourage you to be aware when you 
		        use a Third Party Property or leave the Sites, to review any such third party’s data and information 
		        collection and use practices and policies with regard to their Web site, products or services. We are 
		        not responsible for the actions of third parties with respect to Personal Information that you may share 
		        with such third parties directly.</p>
		        <p>We may need to disclose the Personal Information we collect from you when required 
		        by law or otherwise necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, criminal investigation, court 
		        order, or other legal process. We may also share your Personal Information if we believe it is necessary 
		        in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations 
		        involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or violations of our terms of use.</p>
		        <p>To the extent we use third party service providers or have co-sponsors of any 
		        survey, promotion or content, the information we collect from you may be accessed or shared as part of 
		        the service or event with any such third party or co-sponsor, provided that any such disclosure will be 
		        subject to written agreement with such third party or co-sponsor to only use such information for the 
		        purpose of the service or event and to not share or make any other use of the information.</p>
		        <p>We may use, disclose and share any Anonymous Information we collect with any third party in our sole discretion.</p>
		        
		        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Safe Harbor</p>
		        <p>We follow the U.S. Department of Commerce’s European Union safe harbor framework 
		        (“U.S. Safe Harbor”) regarding adequate privacy protection respecting the collection, use and retention 
		        of personal data received from the European Economic Area. In the event of a dispute regarding personal 
		        information transferred from the European Economic Area to the U.S., we shall endeavor to resolve such 
		        dispute directly with the complainant. Such disputes that are not capable of direct resolution shall be 
		        resolved depending upon the nature of the personal information, by either resorting to applicable European 
		        Data Protection Authorities or by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in 
		        accordance with its applicable arbitration rules. For more information on the U.S. Safe Harbor, go to 
		        www.export.gov/safeharbor.</p>
		        
		        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Children’s Privacy</p>
		        <p>The Sites are intended for adults. We do not knowingly collect personal 
		        information from children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly use or share personal information 
		        from users under 13 years of age with third parties. It is possible that by fraud, deception or 
		        mistake, we may receive information given to us by or pertaining to children under the age of 13. 
		        If we are notified of this, we will immediately delete the information from our servers.</p>
		        
		        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Storage and Security</p>
		        <p>We have implemented and use a variety of industry accepted physical, 
		        electronic and managerial policies and procedures to safeguard and secure the information we 
		        collect to help prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction and to 
		        maintain its accuracy and correct use. We generally store the information and data we collect 
		        on our own servers in a secure environment and restrict access to Personal Information to 
		        employees and agents who use that information in order to provide you with access and use 
		        of the Sites and Services, operate and maintain the Sites and our distribution network and 
		        as otherwise set forth and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. While we have taken efforts 
		        to safeguard and secure your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee that your information may 
		        not be disclosed, altered or destroyed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of 
		        others.</p>
		        
		        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Transfer; Merger</p>
		        <p>Information about our users and the access and use of the Sites and Services 
		        is one of our most important business assets. As such, information about our users, including Personal 
		        Information, may be disclosed and transferred as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a 
		        separate business to provide products and services, the sale or pledge of company assets, as well 
		        as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which Personal Information would be 
		        transferred as one of the business assets.</p>
		        
		        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Choice</p>
		        <p>You have the choice of whether or not to provide us with Personal 
		        Information. You may access, correct, update and/or delete the Personal Information we collect 
		        and store about you by contacting us using the contact information provided above. Be advised, 
		        however, that access to and use of the Sites and/or the Services may be adversely affected, 
		        restricted or unavailable if you choose not to provide us with or to restrict the use of information 
		        that is required for use of the Sites or Services. </p>
