  demographic information. We ask that you do not enter personal information or

  font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">We may review all demographic information.
  We may use public information to enable other users to find your profile, to
  determine whether they are a match for you and to communicate with you. We
  may use demographic information to tailor the Service and communications to
  your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on
  an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers your
  identity). One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood
  that our advertisers’ goods and services will appeal to Webdate.com’s users,
  so that we may target specific ads at specific demographic groups. Our
  sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., we do
  not tell advertisers which particular Webdate.com users are members of which
  demographic groups), subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When you
  respond to an advertisement, however, we ask you to remember that if that ad
  that is targeted to a demographic group and you decide to give the advertiser
  your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify you as
  being a member of that demographic group. Please also be aware that when we
  disclose your financial information or personal information to a Co-Branded
  Company, as described above, we may also disclose to that Co-Branded Company
  your demographic information, other than the content of one-on-one
  communications between you and other members. Please also be aware that we
  may disclose your demographic information on a non-anonymous basis as
  described above in the paragraph titled "Special Cases in which we Share
  Personal and Financial Information." Also, to read further details about
  how we may use your public information, see our </span></span><span class="cssglobalsystextdarkgray1"><span style="font-size:8.5pt"><a href="http://www.webdate.com/terms.php"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Terms
