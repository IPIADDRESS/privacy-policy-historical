	At www.weber.com we don't just stand behind our merchandise. We also do our best to provide a safe and convenient online 
	shopping experience.<br><br>
	
	If you're not quite comfortable shopping online, or would prefer to make your purchase via telephone, just give us a 
	call at 1-800-446-1071. Our Customer Service representatives are standing by 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They'll 
	be happy to take your www.weber.com order right over the phone. <br><br><strong>Credit Card Safety</strong><br>
	Protecting the safety of your credit card information is important to us. <br><br>
	
	We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your credit card information as it is 
	transmitted to us. <br><br>
	
	SSL is the gold standard in Internet encryption technology, which is a fancy way of saying that it's a highly 
	sophisticated method of scrambling data as it travels from your computer to our website's servers.<br><br>
	
	At www.weber.com we don't just stand behind our merchandise. We also do our best to provide a safe and convenient 
	online shopping experience.<br><br>

	<br><a href="#top">TOP</a><br><br><a name="q10"><strong>Q. How do I know my credit card information is secure?</strong></a><br>
	To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower 
	right-hand corner of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL 
	is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or Location line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure 
	server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from "http" to "https." <br><br>
	
	Some browser versions and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to 
	process orders at www.weber.com. If for any reason you cannot access the secure server, please feel free to place your 
	order with us by phone at 1-800-446-1071. Our Customer Service representatives will be happy to assist you.
