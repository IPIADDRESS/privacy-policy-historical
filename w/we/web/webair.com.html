These third party specialists that provide support to our Website and Content are our operational service providers and we use them to efficiently provide the full range of Content, services, promotions, advertising, downloading and other features and functions we offer or make available to you.  We request that our operational service providers also protect your privacy and not disclose your Personal Information to third party marketers that are not associated with us.  Additionally, these operational service providers are not permitted to use your Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes. </p>
				<p> We will make your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties in the following limited circumstances: </p>
				<ul>
                  <li> When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g. to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process); </li>
				  <li> If we believe your actions violate any law, regulation, any term or condition of the Terms of Use, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy, or any Additional Terms or rules applicable to Content or if you threaten the rights, property or safety of us, our parent, subsidiaries or affiliated companies, our Website, services, any of our operational service providers, suppliers, advertisers, customers, other users, customers or any other party; </li>
				  <li> If in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries to protect our business and assets, to defend our interests, or to comply with any legal and regulatory obligations; or </li>
				  <li> In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us. </li>
			  </ul><br class="clear">
				<h3><strong>Cookies and Similar Technology.</strong></h3>
				<p> We use cookie technology to collect data regarding your visits to our Website and your use of our Website. This data is stored in aggregate form and is not used to identify any particular user or individual.  We use cookies and similar tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including: </p>
				<ul>
                  <li>Saving your user ID or other information so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit or use our Website;</li>
				  <li>Keeping count of your return visits to our Website, advertisers or partners' sites;</li>
				  <li>Accumulating and reporting aggregate, statistical information in connection with our Website and Content; and</li>
				  <li>Determining which Websites, Content, features and functions users like best.</li>
			  </ul>
				<p> Although we may track the numbers of users to inform us on how best to update and enhance our Website, Personal Information is not extracted in this process.  We use tracking information on an aggregated basis to help us operate, enhance, and improve our Website and display advertising and marketing information.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie or image tag is being sent or you can choose to turn off all such mechanisms. This is done through your browser.  If you turn cookies off, you may not have access to many features and functions of our Website that make your experience more efficient and enjoyable and our Website may not function properly.  					Our Website may contain advertisements, references and links to other services, websites and organizations.  We may also use third parties to display or serve advertising and to communicate to you.  Often these third parties employ cookie and web bug technologies to measure advertising effectiveness.  You should be aware that different rules apply to the collection, storage, maintenance, use and disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other websites you encounter on the Internet.  The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not ours and even if we have a relationship with a third party, we do not control their websites, their technology or policies and practices regarding your information.  This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Personal Information that a third party, an advertiser or ad server may collect from you. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard. </p>
				<h3><strong>Security and Protection of Personal Information.</strong></h3>
				<p> We maintain commercially reasonable standards of security and confidentiality to protect and ensure the security of your Personal Information.  We also take commercially reasonable measures to prevent any open proxies, open relays and the dissemination of computer viruses, worms, or trojan horses in connection with our e-mail network.  However, for most Internet websites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission.  We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of our Website in the same way. We also limit access to our Website by our own employees to individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes.  We request that our operational service providers follow the same policy.  
								If you do not understand or are not sure what Personal Information may be collected or used for particular purposes, you should contact our Privacy Administrator via email at privacy@webair.com and be prepared to provide verification of your identity.  If you become aware of any abuse or misuse of Personal Information in connection with our Website, through e-mail communications which appear to be from us or violations of our Privacy Policy, please report such issues to us at <a href="mailto:abuse@webair.com">abuse@webair.com</a>. </p>
				<h3><strong> Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information. </strong></h3>
				<p>Generally, you may review, update or delete any of your Personal Information collected by or through our Website. You may also correct factual inaccuracies.  However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information, but cannot be deleted and if you delete or attempt to delete such information, it may result in the suspension of any and all rights you may have to use our Website, your registration as a user and/or other aspects of our Website or services we make available to you.  If you have registered for our Website or provided any information as part of an account or profile in connection with our Website, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information and you should go to our Website and follow the instructions there that will explain how you can edit, change, update and, with some exceptions noted, delete your Personal Information.  	
				</p><p> We reserve the right to deny, suspend, deactivate, terminate and/or cancel any registration, use of or access to our Website and any services, content, activities, features or functions, if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to use or access any portion of our Website, to receive any services from us, to use or access any information or to use a user ID.  If the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide you access to such information.  In such cases, we will provide you with an explanation of why access cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries. </p>
				<h3><strong>Privacy Rights of California Residents:</strong></h3>
				<p> Residents of the State of California, under the California Civil   Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in   California, a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct   marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an   Opt-Out or Opt-In choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated   companies) for marketing purposes, the company may, instead, provide you with information on how to exercise your   disclosure choice options.  					Webair qualifies for the alternative option: it has a comprehensive   Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either decline to permit (Opt-Out) or consent to (Opt-In)   the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to   maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during   the preceding year.  					If you are a California resident and request information about how   to exercise your third party disclosure choices, you must send a request to the following address with a preference on   how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:privacy@webair.com">privacy@webair.com.</a> or you may contact us via postal mail at: </p>
