				</p>

				<h3>Disclosure to Third Parties.</h3>
				<p>
					We do not sell, rent, lease or disclose your Personal Information to non-affiliated entities 
					(i.e., entities that are not subsidiary or affiliated companies) or entities that are not our advertisers or operational 
					service providers, except in the limited circumstances disclosed in this Privacy Policy.  If we plan to disclose your 
					Personal Information to any non-affiliated entities, we will ask for you to Opt-in, in which case their use of your 
					information is subject to their privacy policies.  We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information to third 
					parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining our Website and our operations. These third party specialists 
					that provide support to our Website and Content are our operational service providers and we use them to efficiently 
					provide the full range of Content, services, promotions, advertising, downloading and other features and functions we 
					offer or make available to you.  We request that our operational service providers also protect your privacy and not 
					disclose your Personal Information to third party marketers that are not associated with us.  Additionally, these 
					operational service providers are not permitted to use your Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional 
					purposes.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will make your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties in the following limited circumstances:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court 
						orders or legal process);
					</li>
					<li>
						If we believe your actions violate any law, regulation, any term or condition of the Terms of Use, including, without 
						limitation, this Privacy Policy, or any of Additional Terms or rules applicable to Content or if you threaten the rights, 
						property or safety of us, our parent, subsidiaries or affiliated companies, our Website, services, any of our operational 
						service providers, suppliers, advertisers, customers, other users, customers or any other party;
					</li>
					<li>
						If in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible 
						problems or inquiries to protect our business and assets, to defend our interests, or to comply with any legal and 
						regulatory obligations; or
					</li>
					<li>
						In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination 
						involving us.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Cookies and Similar Technology.</h3>
				<p>
					We use cookie technology to collect data regarding your visits to our Website and your use 
					of our Website. This data is stored in aggregate form and is not used to identify any particular user or individual.  We 
					use cookies and similar tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including:
				</p>
				<ul> 
					<li>Saving your user ID or other information so you dont have to re-enter it each time you visit or use our Website;</li>
					<li>Keeping count of your return visits to our Website, advertisers or partners sites;</li>
					<li>Accumulating and reporting aggregate, statistical information in connection with our Website and Content; and</li>
					<li>Determining which Websites, Content, features and functions users like best.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					Although we may track the numbers of users to inform us on how best to update and enhance our Website, Personal 
					Information is not extracted in this process.  We use tracking information on an aggregated basis to help us operate, 
					enhance, and improve our Website and display advertising and marketing information.  You can choose to have your computer 
					warn you each time a cookie or image tag is being sent or you can choose to turn off all such mechanisms. This is done 
					through your browser.  If you turn cookies off, you may not have access to many features and functions of our Website that 
					make your experience more efficient and enjoyable and our Website may not function properly.
					Our Website may contain advertisements, references and links to other services, websites and organizations.  We may also 
					use third parties to display or serve advertising and to communicate to you.  Often these third parties employ cookie and 
					web bug technologies to measure advertising effectiveness.  You should be aware that different rules apply to the 
					collection, storage, maintenance, use and disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their 
					advertisements, promotions, and other websites you encounter on the Internet.  The use of such technology by these third 
					parties is within their control and not ours and even if we have a relationship with a third party, we do not control 
					their websites, their technology or policies and practices regarding your information.  This Privacy Policy does not cover 
					any use of Personal Information that a third party, an advertiser or ad server may collect from you.  We encourage you to 
					investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard.
				</p>

				<h3>Security and Protection of Personal Information.</h3>
				<p>
					We maintain commercially reasonable standards of security and 
					confidentiality to protect and ensure the security of your Personal Information.  We also take commercially reasonable 
					measures to prevent any open proxies, open relays and the dissemination of computer viruses, worms, or trojan horses in 
					connection with our e-mail network.  However, for most Internet websites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully 
					intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission.  We conduct financial 
					transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of our Website in the same way.  We also 
					limit access to our Website by our own employees to individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such 
					information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our 
					disciplinary processes.  We request that our operational service providers follow the same policy.
					Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information.  Generally, you may review, update or delete any of your Personal 
					Information collected by or through our Website.  You may also correct factual inaccuracies.  However, Personal 
					Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, may be modified with sufficient 
					verification of the correct information, but cannot be deleted and if you delete or attempt to delete such information, it 
					may result in the suspension of any and all rights you may have to use our Website, your registration as a user and/or 
					other aspects of our Website or services we make available to you.  If you have registered for our Website or provided any 
					information as part of an account or profile in connection with our Website, you may review, update or delete your 
					Personal Information and you should go to our Website and follow the instructions there that will explain how you can 
					edit, change, update and, with some exceptions noted, delete your Personal Information.
					If you do not understand or are not sure what Personal Information may be collected or used for particular purposes, you 
					should contact our Privacy Administrator via email at privacy@webair.com and be prepared to provide verification of your 
					identity.  If you become aware of any abuse or misuse of Personal Information in connection with our Website, through 
					e-mail communications which appear to be from us or violations of our Privacy Policy, please report such issues to us at 
					<a href="mailto:abuse@webair.com">abuse@webair.com</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					We reserve the right to deny, suspend, deactivate, terminate and/or cancel any registration, use of or access to our 
					Website and any services, content, activities, features or functions, if we believe there is a question about the identity 
					of the person trying to use or access any portion of our Website, to receive any services from us, to use or access any 
					information or to use a user ID.  If the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is 
					disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not 
					to provide you access to such information.  In such cases, we will provide you with an explanation of why access cannot be 
					provided and a contact person for further inquiries.
				</p>

				<h3>Privacy Rights of California Residents:</h3>
				<p>
					Residents of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, have 
					the right to request from companies conducting business in California, a list of all third parties to which the company has 
					disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides 
					that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an Opt-out or Opt-in choice for use of your Personal 
					Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may, 
					instead, provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.
					Webair qualifies for the alternative option: it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how 
					you may either decline to permit (Opt-out) or consent to (Opt-in) the use of your Personal Information by third parties 
					for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that 
					received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.
					If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, you 
					must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email 
					or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:privacy@webair.com">privacy@webair.com.</a> or you may contact us via postal mail 
					at: 
				</p>

					</strong>
				</p><p>
				
				</p><p>
					All requests sent via postal mail must be labeled Your California Privacy Rights on the envelope or post card and clearly 
					stated on the actual request. For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. (Your 
					street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email. Please include your zip code for
