					<div class="entry-content">

If  you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the  content of your email messages together with your email address and our  responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic  communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received  by mail and telephone.<br>
<strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong><br>
Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard  technology called “cookies” (see explanation below, “What Are Cookies?”)  and web server log files to collect information about how our Web site  is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may  include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our  Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web  site.</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</strong></p>
<p>Broadly  speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our  business activities, providing the products and services you requested,  to process your payment, ,        to       monitor the use of the service, our marketing and        promotional efforts and       improve       our content and service  offerings, and customize our       site’s content, layout, services and  for other       lawful purposes. These uses improve       our site and  better tailor it to meet your       needs.</p>

You may notify us at any time if you  do not wish to receive these offers by emailing us at the link provided  on the newsletter.</p>
<p><strong>What Are Cookies?</strong><br>
A  cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous  unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site’s computer asks  your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard  drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its  own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but  (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access  the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by  other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you  would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of  your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser  refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not  function as effectively when viewed by the users.<strong>A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</strong><br>
As  you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to  differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies  to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for  security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server’s log files, allow  us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site  and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather  feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our  clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information  about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information  that your browser provided to us in your cookies.</p>
<p><strong>IP Addresses</strong><br>
IP  addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the  Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the  network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically  collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data  known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request)  can be sent to you.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing and Selling Information</strong><br>
We <strong>do not</strong> share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely  identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details) with  anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or  provide services that you have requested.</p>
<p><strong>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</strong><br>
You  may request access to all your personally identifiable information that  we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us at the  usual address.</p>
<p><strong>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of       Information?<br>
</strong> We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in  other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or  for the protection of our legal rights. We  may also disclose account information when we have reason to believe  that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or  bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of  Service or to protect the safety of our users and the Public.</p>
<p><strong>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</strong><br>
We  are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to  or from our Web site or the information or content contained therein.  Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to  information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site.</p>
<p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to  another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your  browsing and interaction on any other web site, including web sites,  which have a link on our Website, is subject to that Web site’s own  rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before  proceeding.</p>
<p><strong>Your Consent</strong><br>
By  using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your  personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the  right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without notice.</p>
<p><em><strong> Our Commitment To Data Security:</strong></em></p>
<p>Please  note that your information will be stored and processed on our  computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the  United States may be less stringent than the laws of your Country of  residence or citizenship. To  prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the  correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,  electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the  information we collect online.</p>
<p><strong>Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out<br>
</strong> This site allows visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not  receive future messages. After unsubscribing we will discontinue sending  the particular messages as soon as technically feasible.</p>
<p><strong>Surveys &amp; Contests</strong></p>
<p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys  or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely  voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose  this information. Information requested may include contact information  (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such  as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the  winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes  of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>
<p><strong>A Special Note About Children</strong></p>
<p>Children are not eligible to use our services unsupervised  and we ask that children (under the age of 14) do not submit any  personal information to us. If you are a minor, you can use this service  only in conjunction with permission and guidance from your parents or  guardians.</p>
<p><strong>Acquisition or Changes in Ownership</strong></p>
<p>In the event that the web site (or a substantial portion of its assets)  is acquired, your information would be considered part of those assets,  and may be part of those assets that are transferred.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Modifications<br>
</strong>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes  are made to this privacy policy, we will email users who have given us  permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check  back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy  changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you  have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is  materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior  consent.</p>
