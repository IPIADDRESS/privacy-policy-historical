<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span>When 	you interact with our advertising and applications on third-party 	websites and services, if those applications or advertising include 	links to this policy.</span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span><strong>Who we are</strong></span></span></p>
<p><a></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span>Webit stands for a global community and a series of events, the largest of which welcomes over 15 000 attendees from 110 countries.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span><strong>Collection of Personal Data</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span>Under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) personal data is defined as: </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“<span>any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span>By "Usage Information" or "Usage Data" we mean information about an individual’s online activity that, by itself, does not identify the individual, such as browser type, operating system,  top viewed and visited pages and links on our web site, top entry and exit points, number of form completions, time spent on pages, top downloads, top keywords used offsite to lead customers to our website, information collected via cookies, and other device event information such as system activity, crashes, and hardware settings.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span>Generally, we do not consider Usage Data as Personal Information because Usage Data by itself usually does not identify an individual. Personal Information and Usage Data may be linked together. Different types of Usage Information also may be linked together and, once linked, may identify an individual person. In such cases it is treated and protected as Personal Data. Also, some Usage Data may be Personal Information under applicable law.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong>Legal Basis for The Processing of Personal Data from EEA Residents </strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you reside within the European Economic Area (EEA), our processing of your personal information will be legitimized as follows: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Whenever we 	require your consent for the processing of your personal information 	such processing will be justified pursuant to Article 6(1) lit. (a) 	of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”). </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>If the 	processing of your personal data is necessary for the performance of 	a contract between you and Webit Foundation or for taking any 	pre-contractual steps upon your request, such processing will be 	based on GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (b).”). If this data is not 	processed, Webit Foundation will not be able to register you for a 	selected event. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Where the 	processing is necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation, we 	will process your information on basis of GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (c)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>And where the 	processing is necessary for the purposes of Webit Fondation’s 	legitimate interests, such processing will be made in accordance 	with GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (f). “Legitimate Interests” means 	the interests of our company in conducting and managing our business 	to enable us to give you the best service and and most secure 	experience. For example, we have an interest in making sure our 	events  are relevant for you, so we may process your personal data 	to send you information that is tailored to your interests. It can 	also apply to processing that is in your interests as well.</span></p>
</li>

<p><span>For example, we may process your information to protect you against fraud when transacting on our website, and to ensure our websites and systems are secure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When we process your personal information for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative), and your rights under data protection laws.
