Privacy Policy</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="bodtet">We
have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate
our firm commitment to privacy. This Privacy Policy
explains our practices with respect to the collection,
use, and disclosure of personal and non-personal information
provided by visitors to our web site. By using this
site, you signify your assent to these our privacy
practices and the terms and conditions of our web site. </span> </font></p>
<p class="bodtet" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">If
this policy is not agreeable to you, please do not use
this site.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b> <span class="inditites">WHAT
TYPE INFORMATION IS COLLECTED?</span></b><br>
<br>
<span class="bodtet">Personal Information:<br>
<br>
We only collect personal information from visitors to our web site when
they voluntarily provide it to us by completing our registration form
or electing to use one of our services. We may require visitors to provide
us with information including, but not limited to, their name, physical
address, email address, birth date, credit card number, credit card expiration
date, username, password, and on occasion a unique identifier (such as
their motherâ€™s maiden name). </span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b> <span class="inditites">Non-Personal
Information</span></b><br>
<br>
<span class="bodtet">When visitors access our web site,
certain non-personal information may be collected from
them including, but not limited to, their browser type
(e.g., FireFox or Internet Explorer), operating system
(e.g., Windows or Macintosh), IP address, and the domain
name from which they accessed the site (e.g. google.com).
In addition, we may collect information about visitors'
browsing behavior, such as the date and time they visit
the web site, the areas or pages of our web site that
they visit, the amount of time spent viewing the site,
the number of times the visitor returns to the site,
and click-stream data. We use transparent tracking
pixels to determine the number of web site visitors
that have been sent to us through our affiliate network.
We do not track any information about visitors once
they leave our site. We may use cookies (small text
files that are stored on visitors computers when they
access our web site) to collect this information. Information
collected through cookies may be combined with visitors'
personal information. We may also allow unaffiliated
third parties, such as advertisers, to serve cookies
to visitors of our web site. Visitors are always free
to decline cookies, but in doing so they may not be
able to use certain features on our web site. The "help" segment
of the toolbar on most browsers explains how to configure
a browser to not accept new cookies, how to have the
browser inform a user when they receive a new cookie,
and how to erase cookies from their hard drives. </span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b> <span class="inditites">IN
WHAT WAY DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL
INFORMATION?</span></b><br>
<br>
<span class="bodtet">Our goal in collecting personal information
is to provide visitors with the most personalized web experience
possible and our advertisers with an efficient means to reach
the right audience. By knowing a little about our visitors,
we are able to deliver more relevant content and advertisements,
and provide better services. We may use information collected
from visitors to our web site for any of the following purposes:
(1) to send visitors information and promotional materials
about our company, (2) to send visitors information and promotional
materials from our marketing partners and third parties (such
as advertisers on our web site), (3) to deliver targeted
display advertisements and offers by email (by matching criteria
provided by our advertisers with information collected from
our visitors), (4) to contact visitors to our web site when
necessary, (5) to allow one-click purchases or access to
proprietary content by pre-populating fields, within registration
or other transaction screens, with a visitor's name, billing
address, and credit or charge card information (among other
things), as provided by that visitor, (6) to help diagnose
problems with our server, (7) to administer our web site,
(8) to conduct internal reviews of our site (e.g., to determine
the number of visitors to the site), (9) to help us better
understand visitors' use of our site, and (10) to protect
the security or integrity of our site. Non-personal information
will be used for purposes of conducting internal reviews
of the site, monitoring the site, and providing a greater
online experience for our visitors. </span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b> <span class="inditites">DO
WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION?</span></b><br>
<br>
<span class="bodtet">We may transfer or disclose information
collected from visitors to our web site to our employees
and independent contractors, to our parent company,
subsidiaries and affiliates, and to our consultants,
other business associates, and suppliers, if the disclosure
will enable that party to perform a business, professional,
or technical support function for us, or if required
to do so by law. We may also disclose information we
collect from our site visitors to our marketing and
business partners, who may use the information in connection
with their business operations, such as to send marketing
and other communications to visitors of our site. <br>
We may also share, rent, sell, or transfer any personal information (including
financial information) provided by our visitors to third parties. During
the registration process, and at certain times during any member user
session, we may present additional offers from third party service providers.
Our third party service providers have their own terms and conditions
and privacy policies. We suggest that visitors access these third party
sites and review their terms and conditions and privacy policies before "subscribing" to
any third party offer. If a visitor subscribes to a third party offer
during our registration process, we will transfer the financial data
they provided to us as part of the registration process to that third
party company, which will then process the transaction using that financial
data. We may also share non-personal information we collect from visitors
to our site, such as their browsing behaviors, with third parties. For
example, we may tell a third party advertiser that a certain number of
people have visited a certain area on our web site. </span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b> <span class="inditites">WHAT
SECURITY MEASURES DO WE TAKE TO PROTECT YOUR DATA?</span></b><br>
<span class="bodtet"><br>
To help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data integrity, and ensure
the appropriate use of information, we have put in place certain physical,
electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information
we collect from visitors to our web site. We use SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
technology to protect any credit card information you provide us. We
allow access to personal information only to persons and entities engaging
in activities provided for by this Privacy Policy. Visitors should consider
any communication that they transmit to us (such as data, questions or
answers, comments, suggestions, or communications submitted to a chat
room) to be non-confidential. We will not be liable or responsible if
information that belongs to a visitor is intercepted and used by an unintended
recipient. </span></font></p>

may be transferred to a third party, including personal
information collected from visitors to our web site. </span></font></p>
