<h2 class="headline">Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Protecting your privacy is important to us at fido.net. We strive to keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand the FidoNet Customer Privacy Policy, we can provide you with a better service. Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information.

</p><h3>Why we collect personal information</h3>

<p>FidoNet collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services, and to make a wider ranger available to you. In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, system updates, special offers, and other information we think you'd like to hear about. This may occasionally include information from other technology companies about products and services that can add value to your service. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you to participate in a market research survey, so that we can guage customer satisfaction and develop better products.

</p><h3>How we collect personal information</h3>

<p>We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, call us to make a purchase or request service, register to attend a seminar, or participate in an online survey. In addition, when you register a new product by signing up for new Internet services, or ask to be included in an email mailing list, we collect and store the information you provide in a secure database.

</p><h3>When we disclose personal information</h3>

<p>FidoNet works with other companies that help us provide products and services to you, and we may provide your personal information to these companies. For example, we give shipping companies this information so they can deliver your products efficiently. The information they receive is for shipping and delivery purposes only, and we require that the companies safeguard your personal information in accordance with FidoNet's policies.

</p><p>At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest.

</p><h3>How we protect your personal information</h3>

<p>FidoNet safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic and managerial procedures. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.
 
</p><p>The FidoNet Store uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all Web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases from the FidoNet Store, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.

</p><h3>Collecting other personal information</h3>

<p>When you browse the FidoNet Web site, you are able to do so anonymously. Generally, we don’t collect personal information when you browse - not even your email address. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us the type of computer and operating system you are using.
 
</p><p>Like many Web sites, the FidoNet Web site uses “cookie” technology. When you first connect to our site, the cookie identifies your browser with a unique, random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about you, except perhaps your first name so we can welcome you on your next visit. Cookies help us understand which parts of our Web sites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site even better.
 
</p><p>In some of our email to you, we use a “click-through URL”. When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our Web server before arriving at the Web site that is your destination. We track click-throughs to help us determine your interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.


</p><h3>Our Company-wide committment to privacy</h3>

<p>FidoNet's Web site contains links to other sites. FidoNet does not share your personal information with those Web sites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.
 
</p><p>If we are going to use your personal information differently from that stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email using the most recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information in a new manner.
 
</p><p>The FidoNet Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes.
