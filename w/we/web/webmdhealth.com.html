    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		<h3></h3>
		<div id="blurbText">
WebMD, Inc. ("WebMD") is committed to protecting your privacy.  This Privacy 
Policy will tell you what information we collect about you and about your use of 
the wbmd.com site (the "Site").  It will explain the choices you have about how 
your personal information is used and how we protect that information.  We urge 
you to read this Privacy Policy carefully. 
<br><br>


Other WebMD sites that link from this Site, including WebMD.com, Medscape.com 
and TLBB.com, have their own privacy policies which can be viewed by clicking on 
their links.  Please be aware that this Privacy Policy and any choices you make 
on the Site will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have 
provided to WebMD in the context of other WebMD sites.
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Information We Collect</span><br>

We may collect personal information about you (such as your name, postal 
address, telephone number and email address) that you provide voluntarily. We 
use your personal information that you provide to respond to your questions, 
provide you the specific services you select and send you emails about Site 
maintenance and updates.

<br><br>

Even if you do not provide us with personal information, we collect non-personal 
information about your use of our Site.

<br><br>

We may use "Cookies" and "Web Beacons" to collect anonymous, non-personally 
identifiable information about your use of our Site.  For example, we may use 
cookies to help you navigate our Site more efficiently and statistically monitor 
how many people are using our Site.  "Cookies" are small text records used by 
our system that allow us to track user requests and tailor the resulting user 
experience while on our Site.   "Web Beacons" are tiny graphic image files, 
embedded in a web page in GIF, jpeg or HTML format, that provide a presence on 
the web page and send back to its home server (which can belong to the host 
site, a network advertiser or some other third party) information from your 
browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the beacon is 
located, the type of browser that is accessing the Site and the ID number of any 
Cookies on your computer previously placed by that server.  Web Beacons may also 
be used to place a Cookie on your computer.
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Protection of Children's Personal Information</span><br>
The Site is a general audience site and is not designed or intended to attract 
children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information 
from any person we actually know is under the age of 13. 
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Use of your Personal Information</span><br>

The personal information collected on this Site will be used to provide the 
services you have requested or authorized.
<br><br>


We may use non-personal information for research purposes, and we may provide 
this information in the aggregate to third parties.  For example, we might 
inform third parties regarding the number of users of our Site and the 
activities they conduct while on our Site. 
<br><br>


We contract with other companies and individuals to help us provide services. 
For example, we may host some of our Site on another company's computer, or we 
may hire a company to answer customer questions, send information about our 
products and other services.  In order to perform their jobs, these other 
companies may have limited access to some of the information we maintain about 
you.  We require all such companies to comply with the terms of our Privacy 
Policy, to limit their access to any personal information to the minimum 
necessary to perform their obligations, and not to use the information they may 
access for purposes other than fulfilling their responsibilities to us. 
<br><br>


If we transfer a business unit (such as a subsidiary) or an asset (such as a web 
site) to another company, we will require them to honor the applicable terms of 
this Privacy Policy.  In the event that WebMD or substantially all of its assets 
are acquired by a third party, personally identifiable information will be among 
the transferred assets.
<br><br>


We may release personal information to third parties: (1) to comply with valid 
legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court 
order; or (2) in special cases, such as in response to a physical threat to you 
or others, to protect property or defend or assert legal rights. In the event 
that we are legally compelled to disclose your personal information to a third 
party, we will attempt to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or 
court order.  When we share information with third parties, we ask that they 
agree in writing to abide by our Privacy Policy.
<br><br>


Other than the cases described above, we will not release personal information 
about you to a third party without your consent. 
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Security of your Personal Information</span><br>

We have implemented technology and security policies, rules and other measures 
to protect the personal data that we have under our control from unauthorized 
access, improper use, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction, and 
accidental loss. We also protect your information by requiring that all our 
employees and others who have access to or are associated with the processing of 
your data respect your confidentiality.

<br><br>

Although WebMD makes every reasonable attempt to secure your information, there 
is always some risk in transmitting information over the Internet. There is 
always a risk that thieves could find some way to circumvent our security 
systems. Although we take appropriate measures to protect your information, we 
cannot guarantee that the personal information that we collect will never be 
disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">General</span><br>

If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, wish to access your 
personal information or request that we not use your personal information for a 
particular purpose, 
<script type="text/javascript">
	var emailAdd=('privacy@' + 'webmd.net')
	document.write('please contact us at <A href="mailto:' + emailAdd + '">' + emailAdd + '</a>.')
</script>please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@webmd.net">privacy@webmd.net</a>.
<noscript>then <span style="color: #ff0000;"> please enable JavaScript in your browser. We have used Java Script on this page to help protect our email addresses from spam and you must have Java Script enabled in your browser settings to see them.</span></noscript>
We try to answer all inquiries within a reasonable time, but may not always be able to do so.   

<br><br>

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time.  When we do, we 
will post changes to the Privacy Policy on our Site only and we will also revise 
the "last updated" date at the bottom of the Privacy Policy.  Your continued use 
of this Site constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy.  

<br><br>

This Privacy Policy does not apply to content, business information, ideas, 
concepts or inventions that you send to this Site by email. If you want to keep 
content or business information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or 
proprietary, do not send them in an email to this Site.
