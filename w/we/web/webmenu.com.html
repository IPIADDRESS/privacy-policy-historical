          the following types of information:</p>
        <p> <strong><em>Information you provide</em></strong> - When you sign

          We may combine the information you submit under your account with information 
          from other WebMenu services or third parties in order to provide you 
          with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services.

          combining such information.

          with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and 
          security measures.<br>
          * We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure

          (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of 
          potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address

          sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality 
          of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide 
          notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject 
          to a different privacy policy.</p>
        <p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal 
          information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular 
          term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. 
          Such information does not identify you individually.</p>
        <p>Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions 
          about the management or use of personal data.<br>
          Information security</p>
        <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized 
          access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. 
          These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing 
          practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures 
          to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal 
          data.</p>
        <p>We restrict access to personal information to WebMenu employees, contractors 
          and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop 
          or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality 
          obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination 
          and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.<br>
          Data integrity</p>
        <p>WebMenu processes personal information only for the purposes for which 
          it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable 
          service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage 
          and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process 
          the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or 
          as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to 
          ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, 
          and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal 
          information whenever necessary.<br>
          Accessing and updating personal information</p>
        <p>When you use WebMenu services, we make good faith efforts to provide 
          you with access to your personal information and either to correct this 
          data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it 
          is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business 
          purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information 
          requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such 
          requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably 
          repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, 
          jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical 
          (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), 
          or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we 
          provide information access and correction, we perform this service free 
          of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. 
          Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or 
          delete users' personal information. We provide the details for these 
          procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services.<br>
          Enforcement</p>
        <p>WebMenu regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy.
