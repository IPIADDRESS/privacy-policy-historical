You must register to access all of the services. However, you may be able to access certain limited areas without disclosing any personal and identifiable piece of information. The information we get here is not traced back to any individual and is not used on its own to identify anyone. We do not make use of cookies.

You will also have a choice regarding the newsletters and other information that you may want to receive. If you are required to provide additional information to gain more access, or if we would like to use personally identifiable information about you, we adhere to the strict Privacy Policy. It is our responsibility to explain how we intend to use it and we will require your consent.</p>
<p><strong>3. From Outside Sources</strong><br>
We reserve the right to collect additional information about registered users from third party sources to further assist us in our services. We will use such information to verify and update registration information and confirm licensure status.</p>
<h4>Other Information</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion Boards</strong>: When you post a message to a discussion board, your basic profile will be available for all registered users to see. This said basic profile includes name, specialty, and geographic information. You have the choice to display additional information. Just make sure that you do not post any information about you or any other person to a discussion board or other public forum if you want to keep such information private. Information posted is considered public information and may be used by us and by third parties.</li>

The survey may be administered by one of our companies or a third party market research establishment. Should you choose to participate, provide a response to the survey questions. You may then again be asked to provide further personally identifiable information. Refer to the section on Uses and Disclosures We Make of Your Information for this.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Use of Cookies and Web Beacons</h4>

<ul>
<li>Track usage across the Professional Sites and Services</li>
<li>Help us dynamically generate advertising and content to users</li>
<li>Assess which professional site pages and services you access</li>
</ul>

<p>Most browser software can be set to reject all cookies. If your browser is set to reject, websites that are cookie-enabled will not recognize you when you return to our site. It’s important to note that some website functionality may be lost.</p>
<p>Refer to the help section of your browser to access options.</p>
<p>We may use web beacons and cookies to serve you targeted advertisements when you visit other sites owned and operated by us. We may also use web beacons to track emails. Web beacons are tiny graphic image files, embedded in a website page that notify the home server (which can belong to the host website, a network advertiser, or some other third party) on a non-personally identifiable basis. This may also result in a cookie.</p>
<p>Our contracts with third parties whose web beacons may be placed on our sites to assist us in targeting its advertising are not owned and operated by the people on our end. These web beacons place cookies to enable third parties to collect non-personally identifiable information about you. These third parties have agreed not to use incriminating or personal information. Again, if your browser is set to reject cookies, this non-personally identifiable information will not be sent.</p>
<p>With sale of advertising, we may allow a third party to place a cookie on your browser to enable advertisers to recognize your browser on a non-personally identifiable basis. One again, the same procedures apply.</p>
<p>We do not control the third parties’ use of cookies or web beacons, or how they manage the non-personally identifiable information. However, we do require sponsors, advertisers, and Ad Servers. They have been authorized to collect cookie or web beacon information through the services. They have agreed not to collect any personally identifiable information. Further, they have also agreed not link any non-personal cookie or web beacon.</p>
<p>Certain Ad Servers and third party firms allow you to prevent them from collecting data or serving advertisements through the use of their cookies. You can opt of it. You can also do this for Cookies for several Ad Servers and analytic firms by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative gateway opt-out website. Head over to this site will also allow you to review the privacy policies.</p>
