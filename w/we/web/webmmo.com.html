  <h2 class="welcome">Privacy Policy</h2>
    <h3>This site is owned and operated by www.WebMMO.com. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At www.WebMMO.com, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.</h3>
<p class="lftTxt1">Because we gather certain types of information 
about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms 
and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy 
statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. INFORMATION www.WebMMO.com GATHERS AND TRACKS, www.WebMMO.com gathers two types of information about users:  Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic 
newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, 
and from participation in polls and surveys:<br><br>Information 
www.WebMMO.com gathers through aggregated tracking information derived 
mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us 
to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and 
sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because 
www.WebMMO.com derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and 
advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping 
our service free to users. Under no circumstances does www.WebMMO.com 
divulge any information about an individual user to a third party. www.WebMMO.com Gathers User Information In 
The Following Processes:<br>
Optional Voluntary Information</p>
<p class="lftTxt1">We offer the following free services, which 
require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by 
users:</p>
<p class="lftTxt1">Privacy Policy Sample</p>
<p class="lftTxt1">The following is a list of different policies 
which can be edited to remove the parts of the policy that are not needed. You 
should also add anything to this <strong>policy template</strong> that you may 
have on your site.</p>
<p class="lftTxt1">1. Electronic newsletters policy 
(Dispatches)<br>We will offer a free electronic newsletter to 
users. www.WebMMO.com gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily 
subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the 
link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription 
management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of 
registration.<br><br>
2. Message boards/forums policy<br>
Users of the site's Message Boards and Forums must 
register separately for these services (both are free of charge) in order to 
post messages, although they needn't register to visit the site. During 
registration the user is required to supply a username, password, and email 
address.<br><br>
3. "E-mail this to a friend" policy<br>
Our site users can choose to electronically 
forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a 
friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the 
recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, 
of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not 
used for any other purpose.<br><br>
4. Polling<br>
We may offer interactive polls to users so they 
can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience 
thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are 
aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. www.WebMMO.com 
may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only 
once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about 
individual users.<br><br>
5. Surveys<br>
www.WebMMO.com may occasionally conduct user 
surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the 
aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, 
advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific 
individuals with any third party.</p>
<p class="lftTxt1">
<b>Privacy Policy Template changes</b><br>
The policy clause about children below is 
becoming more important as it is nearly impossible to tell the age of any 
visitor. We recommend adding this sample line to all your forms that request 
information.</p>
<p class="lftTxt1"><b>Usage tracking</b><br>
www.WebMMO.com tracks user traffic patterns 
throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with 
data about individual users. www.WebMMO.com does break down overall usage 
statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by 
reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every 
user's browser).<br><br>
www.WebMMO.com sometimes tracks and catalogs 
the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is 
never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine 
which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those 
areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page 
performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for 
you.<br><br>
<b>Cookies</b><br>
We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the 
browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal 
Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to 
information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only 
personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A 
cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other 
sites. www.WebMMO.com uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as 
described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better 
track ad impressions and click rates.</p>
<p class="lftTxt1">You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your 
browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you 
will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have 
cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to participate 
actively in message boards, forums, polling and surveys.</p>
<p class="lftTxt1"><b>Privacy Policy Use</b><br>
How the information you gather is used if relevant.</p>
<p class="lftTxt1"><b>USE OF INFORMATION</b><br>
www.WebMMO.com uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of 
sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or 
to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.<br>
As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable 
users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out 
newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), 
and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be 
particularly interested in something we are doing. www.WebMMO.com never 
shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, 
sponsors or partners.</p>
<p class="lftTxt1">When we use tracking information to determine 
which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those 
areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page 
performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We 
track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what 
interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user 
enters.</p>
<p class="lftTxt1">www.WebMMO.com creates aggregate reports on 
user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. 
This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users 
to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't 
track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will 
never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any 
information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or 
valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the 
public.</p>
<p class="lftTxt1"><b>SHARING OF THE INFORMATION</b><br>
www.WebMMO.com uses the above-described 
information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers 
better understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping our 
service free. We will not share information about individual users with any 
third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to 
protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</p>
<p class="lftTxt1"><b>SECURITY</b><br>
www.WebMMO.com operates secure data networks 
protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our 
security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as 
necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information 
provided by our customers.</p>
<p class="lftTxt1"><b>OPT-OUT POLICY</b><br>
We give users options wherever necessary and 
practical. Such choices include:
<br><br>Opting not to register to receive our 
electronic newsletters. Opting not to participate in certain interactive 
areas, which completely alleviates the need to gather any personally 
identifiable information from our users.</p>

<p class="lftTxt1"><b>YOUR CONSENT</b><br>
By using this site, you consent to the collection 
and use of this information by www.WebMMO.com. If we decide to change our 
privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always 
aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
circumstances we disclose it. </p>    <br class="spacer">
