</p><p align="center">("Replicon" or "we", "us", "our", etc.)</p>

<span class="header"><center>GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY</center></span>

<p>Replicon is committed to maintaining the privacy of individuals and protecting personal
information in its custody or control in accordance with privacy legislation applicable to
Replicon. This Policy is intended to comply with the requirements of Alberta's <i>Personal
Information Protection Act</i> ("PIPA"). However, in certain circumstances, other
legislation may be applicable.</p>

<p><b>Application</b></p>

<p>This Policy describes and summarizes the practices of Replicon and its affiliates with
respect to our collection, use and/or disclosure of personal information related to all
individuals other than employees and individual contractors of Replicon; those
individuals are subject to a separate policy. Employees of Replicon dealing with
personal information are expected to be familiar with this Policy.</p>

<p><b>Definitions</b></p>

<p>In this Policy, the following terms have the meanings below:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Personal information</b> means information about an identifiable individual, which
does not include information of an aggregate or anonymous nature where a
specific individual or individuals cannot be identified. Personal Information also
does not include <b>business contact information</b>, as long as business contact
information is used to contact an individual in their capacity as an employee or
official of an organization, and for no other purpose. Information about a
corporation, firm, trust, union or other non-individual entity is not personal
information.</li><p></p>
<li><b>Business contact information</b> means an individual’s name and position or title as
an official or employee of an organization, as well as their business telephone
number, business address, business e-mail, business fax number and other
business contact information.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Privacy and our Website</b></p>

<p>We do not collect any personal information from individuals who simply visit our
website. However, individuals should be aware that most web servers do collect some
information about visitors, such as the browser and version being used, the operating
system, and the "IP" or internet address of the visitor, which may identify the individual's
Internet Service Provider or computer but not necessarily the individual using it.</p>

<p>Replicon's website server also use cookies, which are small text files containing
information sent to the computer of a visitor to our website. Cookies are used to help our
web server track such things as user preferences that the user may submit in order to

Information stored in cookies is used to pre-populate form fields and to remember user
preference. This is done for user convenience as well as to provide us with information
on which parts of our website are being viewed and by how many visitors. The tracking
process is anonymous and no personal information is used.</p>

<p><b>Email</b></p>

<p>If you voluntarily submit personal information to us by email for purposes of obtaining
information, we will consider that you have done so with your consent for purposes
reasonably related to your providing the information. If reasonable to do so, after our
initial response, we may send further information to you with information that may be
useful, but we will include instructions on how to terminate receiving such further
information. Please be advised that the Internet and email are inherently insecure media,
and we cannot take responsibility for the security or privacy of personal information in
transit over the Internet.</p>

<p><b>Third Party Websites</b></p>

<p>Please note that our website may contain links to other websites which are provided as a
convenience for visitors to our website only. Any third party websites will have their own
privacy policies and practices, and we cannot be responsible for such third parties, their
websites, or their privacy practices.</p>

<p><b>Sources of Personal Information</b></p>

<p>Replicon generally collects, uses and discloses personal information about the following
types of individuals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Customers, employees of and contractors to customers;</li><p></p>
<li>Prospective or potential customers or their employees;</li><p></p>
<li>Subscribers to Replicon newsletters, white papers or similar types of information;</li><p></p>
<li>Employees and independent contractors (where such contractors are individuals)
of Replicon for the purposes of establishing, managing and terminating
employment and contractor relationships;</li><p></p>
<li>Other individuals who may voluntarily choose to provide Replicon with personal
information.</li><p></p>
<li>Shareholders and investors in Replicon; and,</li><p></p>
<li>Directors of Replicon.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Notification and consent</b></p>

<p>Subject to this Policy and applicable legislation, Replicon will identify the purposes for
collection, use and disclosure in advance of collection, and will notify the individual of
the purposes for collection, use or disclosure at or before the time of collection.</p>

<p>There are a number of exceptions to the above provisions in that in some circumstances,
such as with certain personal information related to employees, Replicon does not require
consent to collect, use or disclose personal information but is required to provide
notification in advance.</p>

<p>In other circumstances, specifically those set out in applicable legislation, the law does
not require that Replicon obtain consent or provide notification. Replicon reserves all its
rights to rely on any available statutory exemptions and exceptions.</p>

<p><b>Exceptions to the requirement for consent</b></p>

<p>Replicon may collect personal information without consent in circumstances that include
but are not limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where a reasonable person would consider that the collection of the
information is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent of the
individual cannot be obtained in a timely way or the individual would not
reasonably be expected to withhold consent;</li><p></p>
<li>Where the collection of the information is pursuant to a statute or regulation
of either Alberta or Canada that authorizes or requires the collection;</li><p></p>
<li>Where the collection of the information is from a public body and that public
body is authorized or required by an enactment of Alberta or Canada to
disclose the personal information to Replicon;</li><p></p>
<li>Where the collection of the information is reasonable for the purposes of an
investigation or a legal proceeding;</li><p></p>
<li>Where the information is publicly available;</li><p></p>
<li>Where the collection of the information is necessary in order to collect a debt
owed to Replicon or for Replicon to repay to an individual money owed by
Replicon.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the above, the law generally provides that an individual is deemed to
consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information about that individual for a particular purpose if the individual voluntarily provides the information for that
purpose, and it is reasonable that a person would voluntarily provide that information. If
an individual provides personal information to us voluntarily, we will rely on deemed
consent and consider that the individual consents to our collection, use or disclosure of
their personal information as necessary to carry out the purposes for which they provided
the information.</p>

<p>Where a new purpose for the use or disclosure of personal information previously
collected arises, Replicon will contact the individual in question to obtain any required
consent or to provide any required notification for use and/or disclosure for such new
purpose or purposes.</p>

<p>Where practical, Replicon will try to collect personal information directly from the
individual. Where necessary, Replicon will collect personal information from other
sources. When Replicon collects personal information about individuals directly from
them, except when their consent to the collection is deemed or has otherwise been
previously and lawfully obtained, or is not required, we will tell them the purpose for
which the information is collected, and, if reasonable to do so, the name of a person who
can answer questions about the collection.</p>

<p><b>Why we collect, use and disclose personal information</b></p>

<p>Replicon generally collects, uses and discloses personal information for the following
purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Customers, employees of and contractors to customers: To establish, maintain,
manage and terminate a relationship with a customer.</li><p></p>
<li>Prospective or potential customers or their employees: To attempt to establish
a relationship with a customer.</li><p></p>
<li>Subscribers to Replicon newsletters, white papers or similar types of
information: To provide services, information or documentation and to solicit
business.</li><p></p>
<li>Suppliers (including non-individual contractors to Replicon), employees of
and contractors to suppliers: To establish, maintain, manage and terminate a
supplier relationship.</li><p></p>
<li>Individuals who may voluntarily choose to provide Replicon with personal
information: To fulfill the purposes for which such information was provided.</li><p></p>
<li>Replicon employees and individual contractors: To recruit, establish,
maintain, manage and terminate an employment or individual contractor
relationship. For further information, Replicon's Employee Privacy Policy
should be consulted.</li><p></p>
<li>Shareholders and investors: To manage our relationship with and our
obligations to investors and shareholders. Replicon is required by applicable
laws and regulatory authorities to collect, as well as use and disclose certain
information with respect to its shareholders.</li><p></p>
<li>Directors and officers: To manage our relationship with and our obligations
to directors and officers. Replicon is required by applicable laws and
regulatory authorities to collect, as well as to use and disclose, certain
information with respect to its directors and officers.</li><p></p>
<li>Other individuals: Personal information from other individuals may be
collected, used or disclosed when such individuals contact Replicon for a
variety of reasons personal to them. For example, if an individual contacts us
with an inquiry, we will use the information provided to assist us in
responding to that individual and communicating with them. Generally, such
information is used to contact or reply to individuals who have contacted us
where such contact or reply is reasonable in the circumstances, or is subject to
deemed consent, or is legally required.</li><p></p>
<li>Telephone Conversations: Please refer to the more comprehensive section on
telephone conversations in this Policy.</li><p></p>
<li>To fulfill our legal obligations.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Use of Personal Information</b></p>

<p>As with collection, there are exceptions to the requirement of consent with respect to use.
For example, Replicon may use personal information without consent in circumstances
that include but are not limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where a reasonable person would consider that the use of the information is
clearly in the interests of the individual and consent of the individual cannot
be obtained in a timely way or the individual would not reasonably be
expected to withhold consent;</li><p></p>

<li>Where the use of the information is pursuant to a statute or regulation of
Alberta or Canada that authorizes or requires the use;</li><p></p>

<li>Where the information in question was collected is from a public body and
that public body is authorized or required by an enactment of Alberta or
Canada to disclose the personal information to Replicon;</li><p></p>

<li>Where the use of the information is reasonable for the purposes of an
investigation or a legal proceeding;</li><p></p>

<li>Where the information is publicly available;</li><p></p>

<li>Where the collection of the information is necessary in order to collect a debt
owed to Replicon or for Replicon to repay to the individual money owed by
Replicon;</li><p></p>

<li>In certain circumstances, where the information may be disclosed without
consent, it may also be used without consent.</li>

</ul>

<p>Replicon will in all cases use personal information as permitted or required by applicable
law.</p>

<p><b>Disclosure of personal information</b></p>

<p>It is the general policy of Replicon to not disclose personal information in its custody or
control except with the consent of the individual and then only for identified purposes.
However, individuals should be aware that there are exceptions to the above.</p>

<p>Alberta law permits us to collect, use or disclose personal information about an individual
in some circumstances without the individual’s consent and/or knowledge. Such
circumstances include (but are not limited) to where:</p>

<ul>

<li>the collection, use or disclosure is clearly in the interests of the individual and
consent cannot be obtained in a timely way;</li><p></p>

<li>collection, use, or disclosure is reasonable for the purposes of an investigation
or proceeding;</li><p></p>

<li>the personal information is available to the public from a prescribed source; or</li><p></p>

<li>the collection, use, or disclosure is required or authorized by a statute or
regulation of Alberta or Canada.</li><p></p>

</ul>

<p>Replicon will in all cases disclose personal information as required or permitted by
applicable law.</p>

<p>Replicon does not disclose, trade or sell its customer or contact lists.</p>

<p><b>Telephone Calls</b></p>

<p>All incoming and outgoing telephone calls using Replicon’s telephone systems are
subject to automated recording and archiving. Recording is a function of certain
technology and cannot be turned off by individual Replicon employees or contractors for
particular cases. Recording is carried out for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>To ensure accuracy of communication. This includes ensuring accuracy of our
understanding of customer requirements, orders and agreements made with
customers, and, if necessary, to accurately document such agreements in the event
of a misunderstanding or dispute to protect both Replicon and the customer;</li><p></p>

<li>To ensure quality of service provided by Replicon representatives.</li><p></p>

</ul>

<p>Recordings of telephone calls are initially not reviewed or overheard in any manner, but
are archived in digital format on a secure server without review. Such recordings may be
subsequently reviewed by Replicon at any time for any one or more of the stated
purposes and, in particular, may be used without notification or consent as evidence in
the event of an investigation or legal proceeding related to such telephone conversation,
or to review the quality of service provided in situations where Replicon has a basis to
believe that such quality may not be adequate and generally only with respect to those
Replicon representatives who interact with customers.</p>

<p>Callers from outside Replicon are advised that their call may be recorded and potentially
used on the foregoing basis by posting a notice to that effect on Replicon’s web site.
Callers have the option at their request of opting out of such recording by asking their
Replicon representative to call them back on a cell phone, which is not subject to
automated recording. Individuals may also communicate with Replicon via email, fax or
mail.</p>

<p>Recordings, including recordings that are not reviewed, are retained on the same basis as
other personal information pursuant to this Policy. Where required or permitted by law,
Replicon may use or disclose personal information contained in recordings. Replicon
does not use information contained in recordings for marketing or solicitation purposes.
Access to such recordings is restricted to particular individuals within Replicon who have
obligations of confidentiality to Replicon and who have a need to review such recordings
as part of their obligations to Replicon.</p>

<p><b>Computer Interaction</b></p>

<p>There are occasions where Replicon representatives may remotely access a computer of a
Replicon customer in order to provide services, including technical support or product
support. Such access may include an exchange of information of a conversational nature
and, while not intended to do so, such access may result in the collection of personal
information incidental to our providing services. The activities carried out during such
access are recorded and archived so that the recording of such activities may later be
viewed or reviewed for the purposes of providing services to the customer in question.
The recording is a video file without sound and is subsequently used only for the
purposes of assisting the customer. In all cases where a computer becomes subject to
access by Replicon, such access will be with the customer’s knowledge and consent.</p>

<p><b>Retention and destruction of personal information</b></p>

<p>Alberta law allows us, for legal or business purposes, to retain personal information for as
long as is reasonable. Upon expiry of an appropriate retention period, bearing in mind
reasonable legal and business requirements, personal information will either be destroyed
in a secure manner or made anonymous.</p>

<p>Should consent to our collection, use, disclosure or retention of personal information be
revoked by the individual in question, the law also allows us to continue to retain the
information for as long as is reasonable for legal or business purposes. In the event that
revocation of consent may have consequences to the individual concerned, we will advise
the individual of the consequences of revoking their consent where it is reasonable in the
circumstances to do so.</p>

<p>When we collect, use or disclose personal information, we will make reasonable efforts
to ensure that it is accurate, up to date, and complete.</p>

<p><b>Security</b></p>

<p>We recognize our legal obligations to protect the personal information we have gathered
about individuals. We have therefore made arrangements to secure against unauthorized
access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or destruction of
personal information. These arrangements may include physical security measures,
network security measures, and organizational measures such as non-disclosure
agreements and need-to-know access.</p>

<p><b>Requests for Access</b></p>

<p>Alberta law permits individuals to submit written requests to us to provide them with:</p>

<ul>
<li>access to their personal information under the custody or control of Replicon;</li><p></p>

<li>information about the purposes for which their personal information under the
custody or control of Replicon has been and is being used; and</li><p></p>

<li>the names of organizations or persons to whom and the circumstances in which
personal information has been and is being disclosed by Replicon.</li><p></p>
</ul>

<p>Requests for access are subject to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any requests must be in writing.</li><p></p>

<li>We do not accept such requests or respond to such requests via email.</li><p></p>

<li>In order to receive a response to such a request, the individual must provide us
with sufficient information to locate their record, if any, and to respond to them.</li><p></p>

<li>We will respond to requests in the time allowed by Alberta law, which is
generally 45 days. In certain circumstances, we may have a right to extend this
period of time and will advise in writing if we are doing so.</li><p></p>

<li>We will make a reasonable effort to assist applicants and to respond as accurately
and completely as reasonably possible.</li><p></p>

<li>All requests may be subject to any fees and disbursements the law permits us to
charge.</li><p></p>

<li>Where appropriate to do so, we may require advance payment of a deposit or the
entire costs of responding to a request for access to personal information.</li><p></p>

</ul>

<p>Please note that an individual’s ability to access his or her personal information under our
control is not an absolute right. Alberta law provides that Replicon must not disclose
personal information where:</p>

<ul>
<li>the disclosure could reasonably be expected to threaten the safety or physical or
mental health of an individual other than the individual who made the request;</li><p></p>

<li>the disclosure would reveal personal information about another individual; or</li><p></p>

<li>the disclosure would reveal the identity of an individual who has in confidence
provided us with an opinion about another individual and the individual providing
the opinion does not consent to the disclosure of his or her identity.</li><p></p>

</ul>

<p>Alberta law also provides that Replicon may choose not to disclose personal information
where:</p>

<ul>

<li>the personal information is protected by any legal privilege;</li><p></p>

<li>the disclosure of the information would reveal confidential commercial
information and it is not unreasonable to withhold that information;</li><p></p>

<li>the personal information was collected by Replicon for an investigation or legal
proceeding;</li><p></p>

<li>the disclosure of the personal information might result in similar information no
longer being provided to us when it is reasonable that it would be provided;</li><p></p>

<li>the personal information was collected or created by a mediator or arbitrator in
the conduct of a mediation or arbitration for which he or she was appointed to act</li><p></p>

    <ul>
    
    <li>under an agreement,</li><p></p>
    
    <li>under an enactment, or</li><p></p>
    
    <li>by a court; or</li><p></p>

    </ul>

<li>the personal information relates to and may be used in the exercise of prosecutorial
discretion.</li><p></p>

</ul>

<p>Replicon reserves all its rights under the above.</p>

<p><b>Responses to Requests</b></p>

<p>Our responses to requests for access to personal information will be in writing, and will
confirm:</p>

<ul>

<li>whether we are providing all or part of the requested information,</li><p></p>

<li>whether or not we are allowing access or providing copies, and,</li><p></p>

<li>if access is being provided, when and how that will be given.</li><p></p>

</ul>

<p>If access to information or copies are refused by us, we will provide written reasons for
such refusal and the section of PIPA (the Personal Information Protection Act, Alberta)
on which that refusal is based. We will also provide the name of an individual at
Replicon who can answer questions about the refusal, and particulars of how the
requesting individual can ask the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta to
review our decision. In order to receive a response to such a request, the individual must
provide us with sufficient information to locate their record, if any, and to respond to
them.</p>

<p><b>Requests for Correction</b></p>

<p>Alberta law permits individuals to submit written requests to us to correct errors or
omissions in their personal information that is in our custody or control. If an individual
alleges errors or omissions in the personal information in our custody or control, we will
either:</p>

<ul>

<li>correct the personal information and, if reasonable to do so, and if not contrary to
law, send correction notifications to any other organizations to whom we
disclosed the incorrect information; or</li><p></p>

<li>decide not to correct the personal information but annotate the personal
information that a correction was requested but not made.</li><p></p>

</ul>

<p>Corrections or amendments will not made to opinions as opposed to factual information,
although we reserve the right to modify opinions where changes in the facts on which
those opinions are based occur.</p>

<p><b>Amendment</b></p>

<p>Replicon may amend this Policy from time to time as required and without notice, in
order to better meet our obligations under the law.</p>

<p><b>Contacting Replicon</b></p>

disclosure or handling of your personal information, or if you wish to request access to,
