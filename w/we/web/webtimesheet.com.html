    <li>Employees and independent contractors (where such contractors are individuals)
    of Replicon for the purposes of establishing, managing and terminating
    employment and contractor relationships;</li><p></p>
    <li>Other individuals who may voluntarily choose to provide Replicon with personal
    information.</li><p></p>
    <li>Shareholders and investors in Replicon; and,</li><p></p>
    <li>Directors of Replicon.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Notification and consent</b></p>

    <p>Subject to this Policy and applicable legislation, Replicon will identify the purposes for
    collection, use and disclosure in advance of collection, and will notify the individual of
    the purposes for collection, use or disclosure at or before the time of collection.</p>

    <p>There are a number of exceptions to the above provisions in that in some circumstances,
    such as with certain personal information related to employees, Replicon does not require
    consent to collect, use or disclose personal information but is required to provide
    notification in advance.</p>

    <p>In other circumstances, specifically those set out in applicable legislation, the law does
    not require that Replicon obtain consent or provide notification. Replicon reserves all its
    rights to rely on any available statutory exemptions and exceptions.</p>

    <p><b>Exceptions to the requirement for consent</b></p>

    <p>Replicon may collect personal information without consent in circumstances that include
    but are not limited to the following:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Where a reasonable person would consider that the collection of the
    information is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent of the
    individual cannot be obtained in a timely way or the individual would not
    reasonably be expected to withhold consent;</li><p></p>
    <li>Where the collection of the information is pursuant to a statute or regulation
    of either Alberta or Canada that authorizes or requires the collection;</li><p></p>
    <li>Where the collection of the information is from a public body and that public
    body is authorized or required by an enactment of Alberta or Canada to
    disclose the personal information to Replicon;</li><p></p>
    <li>Where the collection of the information is reasonable for the purposes of an
    investigation or a legal proceeding;</li><p></p>
    <li>Where the information is publicly available;</li><p></p>
    <li>Where the collection of the information is necessary in order to collect a debt
    owed to Replicon or for Replicon to repay to an individual money owed by
    Replicon.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to the above, the law generally provides that an individual is deemed to
    consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information about that individual for a particular purpose if the individual voluntarily provides the information for that
    purpose, and it is reasonable that a person would voluntarily provide that information. If
    an individual provides personal information to us voluntarily, we will rely on deemed
    consent and consider that the individual consents to our collection, use or disclosure of
    their personal information as necessary to carry out the purposes for which they provided
    the information.</p>

    <p>Where a new purpose for the use or disclosure of personal information previously
    collected arises, Replicon will contact the individual in question to obtain any required
    consent or to provide any required notification for use and/or disclosure for such new
    purpose or purposes.</p>

    <p>Where practical, Replicon will try to collect personal information directly from the
    individual. Where necessary, Replicon will collect personal information from other
    sources. When Replicon collects personal information about individuals directly from
    them, except when their consent to the collection is deemed or has otherwise been
    previously and lawfully obtained, or is not required, we will tell them the purpose for
    which the information is collected, and, if reasonable to do so, the name of a person who
    can answer questions about the collection.</p>

    <p><b>Why we collect, use and disclose personal information</b></p>

    <p>Replicon generally collects, uses and discloses personal information for the following
    purposes:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Customers, employees of and contractors to customers: To establish, maintain,
    manage and terminate a relationship with a customer.</li><p></p>
    <li>Prospective or potential customers or their employees: To attempt to establish
    a relationship with a customer.</li><p></p>

    <li>Subscribers to Replicon newsletters, white papers or similar types of
    information: To provide services, information or documentation and to solicit
    business.</li><p></p>
    <li>Suppliers (including non-individual contractors to Replicon), employees of
    and contractors to suppliers: To establish, maintain, manage and terminate a
    supplier relationship.</li><p></p>
    <li>Individuals who may voluntarily choose to provide Replicon with personal
    information: To fulfill the purposes for which such information was provided.</li><p></p>
    <li>Replicon employees and individual contractors: To recruit, establish,
    maintain, manage and terminate an employment or individual contractor
    relationship. For further information, Replicon's Employee Privacy Policy
    should be consulted.</li><p></p>
    <li>Shareholders and investors: To manage our relationship with and our
    obligations to investors and shareholders. Replicon is required by applicable
    laws and regulatory authorities to collect, as well as use and disclose certain
    information with respect to its shareholders.</li><p></p>
    <li>Directors and officers: To manage our relationship with and our obligations
    to directors and officers. Replicon is required by applicable laws and
    regulatory authorities to collect, as well as to use and disclose, certain
    information with respect to its directors and officers.</li><p></p>
    <li>Other individuals: Personal information from other individuals may be
    collected, used or disclosed when such individuals contact Replicon for a
    variety of reasons personal to them. For example, if an individual contacts us
    with an inquiry, we will use the information provided to assist us in
    responding to that individual and communicating with them. Generally, such
    information is used to contact or reply to individuals who have contacted us
    where such contact or reply is reasonable in the circumstances, or is subject to
    deemed consent, or is legally required.</li><p></p>
    <li>Telephone Conversations: Please refer to the more comprehensive section on
    telephone conversations in this Policy.</li><p></p>
    <li>To fulfill our legal obligations.</li>

    </ul>

    <p><b>Use of Personal Information</b></p>

    <p>As with collection, there are exceptions to the requirement of consent with respect to use.
    For example, Replicon may use personal information without consent in circumstances
    that include but are not limited to the following:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Where a reasonable person would consider that the use of the information is
    clearly in the interests of the individual and consent of the individual cannot
    be obtained in a timely way or the individual would not reasonably be
    expected to withhold consent;</li><p></p>

    <li>Where the use of the information is pursuant to a statute or regulation of
    Alberta or Canada that authorizes or requires the use;</li><p></p>

    <li>Where the information in question was collected is from a public body and
    that public body is authorized or required by an enactment of Alberta or
    Canada to disclose the personal information to Replicon;</li><p></p>

    <li>Where the use of the information is reasonable for the purposes of an
    investigation or a legal proceeding;</li><p></p>

    <li>Where the information is publicly available;</li><p></p>

    <li>Where the collection of the information is necessary in order to collect a debt
    owed to Replicon or for Replicon to repay to the individual money owed by
    Replicon;</li><p></p>

    <li>In certain circumstances, where the information may be disclosed without
    consent, it may also be used without consent.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Replicon will in all cases use personal information as permitted or required by applicable
    law.</p>

    <p><b>Disclosure of personal information</b></p>

    <p>It is the general policy of Replicon to not disclose personal information in its custody or
    control except with the consent of the individual and then only for identified purposes.
    However, individuals should be aware that there are exceptions to the above.</p>

    <p>Alberta law permits us to collect, use or disclose personal information about an individual
    in some circumstances without the individual's consent and/or knowledge. Such
    circumstances include (but are not limited) to where:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>the collection, use or disclosure is clearly in the interests of the individual and
    consent cannot be obtained in a timely way;</li><p></p>

    <li>collection, use, or disclosure is reasonable for the purposes of an investigation
    or proceeding;</li><p></p>

    <li>the personal information is available to the public from a prescribed source; or</li><p></p>

    <li>the collection, use, or disclosure is required or authorized by a statute or
    regulation of Alberta or Canada.</li><p></p>

    </ul>

    <p>Replicon will in all cases disclose personal information as required or permitted by
    applicable law.</p>

    <p>Replicon does not disclose, trade or sell its customer or contact lists.</p>

    <p><b>Telephone Calls</b></p>

    <p>All incoming and outgoing telephone calls using Replicon's telephone systems are
    subject to automated recording and archiving. Recording is a function of certain
    technology and cannot be turned off by individual Replicon employees or contractors for
    particular cases. Recording is carried out for the following purposes:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>To ensure accuracy of communication. This includes ensuring accuracy of our
    understanding of customer requirements, orders and agreements made with
    customers, and, if necessary, to accurately document such agreements in the event
    of a misunderstanding or dispute to protect both Replicon and the customer;</li><p></p>

    <li>To ensure quality of service provided by Replicon representatives.</li><p></p>

    </ul>

    <p>Recordings of telephone calls are initially not reviewed or overheard in any manner, but
    are archived in digital format on a secure server without review. Such recordings may be
    subsequently reviewed by Replicon at any time for any one or more of the stated
    purposes and, in particular, may be used without notification or consent as evidence in
    the event of an investigation or legal proceeding related to such telephone conversation,
    or to review the quality of service provided in situations where Replicon has a basis to
    believe that such quality may not be adequate and generally only with respect to those
    Replicon representatives who interact with customers.</p>

    <p>Callers from outside Replicon are advised that their call may be recorded and potentially
    used on the foregoing basis by posting a notice to that effect on Replicon's web site.
    Callers have the option at their request of opting out of such recording by asking their
    Replicon representative to call them back on a cell phone, which is not subject to
    automated recording. Individuals may also communicate with Replicon via email, fax or
    mail.</p>

    <p>Recordings, including recordings that are not reviewed, are retained on the same basis as
    other personal information pursuant to this Policy. Where required or permitted by law,
    Replicon may use or disclose personal information contained in recordings. Replicon
    does not use information contained in recordings for marketing or solicitation purposes.
    Access to such recordings is restricted to particular individuals within Replicon who have
    obligations of confidentiality to Replicon and who have a need to review such recordings
    as part of their obligations to Replicon.</p>

    <p><b>Computer Interaction</b></p>

    <p>There are occasions where Replicon representatives may remotely access a computer of a
    Replicon customer in order to provide services, including technical support or product
    support. Such access may include an exchange of information of a conversational nature
    and, while not intended to do so, such access may result in the collection of personal
    information incidental to our providing services. The activities carried out during such
    access are recorded and archived so that the recording of such activities may later be
    viewed or reviewed for the purposes of providing services to the customer in question.
    The recording is a video file without sound and is subsequently used only for the
    purposes of assisting the customer. In all cases where a computer becomes subject to
    access by Replicon, such access will be with the customer's knowledge and consent.</p>

    <p><b>Retention and destruction of personal information</b></p>

    <p>Alberta law allows us, for legal or business purposes, to retain personal information for as
    long as is reasonable. Upon expiry of an appropriate retention period, bearing in mind
    reasonable legal and business requirements, personal information will either be destroyed
    in a secure manner or made anonymous.</p>

    <p>Should consent to our collection, use, disclosure or retention of personal information be
    revoked by the individual in question, the law also allows us to continue to retain the
    information for as long as is reasonable for legal or business purposes. In the event that
    revocation of consent may have consequences to the individual concerned, we will advise
    the individual of the consequences of revoking their consent where it is reasonable in the
    circumstances to do so.</p>

    <p>When we collect, use or disclose personal information, we will make reasonable efforts
    to ensure that it is accurate, up to date, and complete.</p>

    <p><b>Security</b></p>

    <p>We recognize our legal obligations to protect the personal information we have gathered
    about individuals. We have therefore made arrangements to secure against unauthorized
    access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or destruction of
    personal information. These arrangements may include physical security measures,
    network security measures, and organizational measures such as non-disclosure
    agreements and need-to-know access.</p>

    <p><b>Requests for Access</b></p>

    <p>Alberta law permits individuals to submit written requests to us to provide them with:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>access to their personal information under the custody or control of Replicon;</li><p></p>

    <li>information about the purposes for which their personal information under the
    custody or control of Replicon has been and is being used; and</li><p></p>

    <li>the names of organizations or persons to whom and the circumstances in which
    personal information has been and is being disclosed by Replicon.</li><p></p>
    </ul>

    <p>Requests for access are subject to the following:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Any requests must be in writing.</li><p></p>

    <li>We do not accept such requests or respond to such requests via email.</li><p></p>

    <li>In order to receive a response to such a request, the individual must provide us
    with sufficient information to locate their record, if any, and to respond to them.</li><p></p>

    <li>We will respond to requests in the time allowed by Alberta law, which is
    generally 45 days. In certain circumstances, we may have a right to extend this
    period of time and will advise in writing if we are doing so.</li><p></p>

    <li>We will make a reasonable effort to assist applicants and to respond as accurately
    and completely as reasonably possible.</li><p></p>

    <li>All requests may be subject to any fees and disbursements the law permits us to
    charge.</li><p></p>

    <li>Where appropriate to do so, we may require advance payment of a deposit or the
    entire costs of responding to a request for access to personal information.</li><p></p>

    </ul>

    <p>Please note that an individual's ability to access his or her personal information under our
    control is not an absolute right. Alberta law provides that Replicon must not disclose
    personal information where:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>the disclosure could reasonably be expected to threaten the safety or physical or
    mental health of an individual other than the individual who made the request;</li><p></p>

    <li>the disclosure would reveal personal information about another individual; or</li><p></p>

    <li>the disclosure would reveal the identity of an individual who has in confidence
    provided us with an opinion about another individual and the individual providing
    the opinion does not consent to the disclosure of his or her identity.</li><p></p>

    </ul>

    <p>Alberta law also provides that Replicon may choose not to disclose personal information
    where:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>the personal information is protected by any legal privilege;</li><p></p>

    <li>the disclosure of the information would reveal confidential commercial
    information and it is not unreasonable to withhold that information;</li><p></p>

    <li>the personal information was collected by Replicon for an investigation or legal
    proceeding;</li><p></p>

    <li>the disclosure of the personal information might result in similar information no
    longer being provided to us when it is reasonable that it would be provided;</li><p></p>

    <li>the personal information was collected or created by a mediator or arbitrator in
    the conduct of a mediation or arbitration for which he or she was appointed to act</li><p></p>

        <ul>
        
        <li>under an agreement,</li><p></p>
        
        <li>under an enactment, or</li><p></p>
        
        <li>by a court; or</li><p></p>

        </ul>

    <li>the personal information relates to and may be used in the exercise of prosecutorial
    discretion.</li><p></p>

    </ul>

    <p>Replicon reserves all its rights under the above.</p>

    <p><b>Responses to Requests</b></p>

    <p>Our responses to requests for access to personal information will be in writing, and will
    confirm:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>whether we are providing all or part of the requested information,</li><p></p>

    <li>whether or not we are allowing access or providing copies, and,</li><p></p>

    <li>if access is being provided, when and how that will be given.</li><p></p>

    </ul>

    <p>If access to information or copies are refused by us, we will provide written reasons for
    such refusal and the section of PIPA (the Personal Information Protection Act, Alberta)
    on which that refusal is based. We will also provide the name of an individual at
    Replicon who can answer questions about the refusal, and particulars of how the
    requesting individual can ask the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta to
    review our decision. In order to receive a response to such a request, the individual must
    provide us with sufficient information to locate their record, if any, and to respond to
    them.</p>

    <p><b>Requests for Correction</b></p>

    <p>Alberta law permits individuals to submit written requests to us to correct errors or
    omissions in their personal information that is in our custody or control. If an individual
    alleges errors or omissions in the personal information in our custody or control, we will
    either:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>correct the personal information and, if reasonable to do so, and if not contrary to
    law, send correction notifications to any other organizations to whom we
    disclosed the incorrect information; or</li><p></p>

    <li>decide not to correct the personal information but annotate the personal
    information that a correction was requested but not made.</li><p></p>

    </ul>

    <p>Corrections or amendments will not made to opinions as opposed to factual information,
    although we reserve the right to modify opinions where changes in the facts on which
    those opinions are based occur.</p>

    <p><b>Amendment</b></p>

    <p>Replicon may amend this Policy from time to time as required and without notice, in
    order to better meet our obligations under the law.</p>

    <p><b>Contacting Replicon</b></p>
