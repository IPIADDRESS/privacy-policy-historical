          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>
                This privacy statement covers iPerceptions Inc.’s (“iPerceptions” or “us”) “WASP” service (the “Service”) available at WebAnalyticsSolutionProfiler.com
            </p>
            <p>
                Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to the privacy of the users of the Service, we have agreed to disclose our information practices with respect to the Service:

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If users have questions or concerns regarding this privacy statement, they should contact our privacy officer by email at: <a href="mailto:privacy@iperceptions.com">privacy@iperceptions.com</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>
                When you sign up for the Service, iPerceptions will ask for information allowing us to identify you and create your password-protected account, such as your full name, address, employer, e-mail address and telephone and fax number. This information will be used to create and maintain your account for as long as you are a user of the service, unless and to the extent a longer retention is permitted or required by law.
            </p>
            <h2>General</h2>
            <p>
                You may withdraw your consent to our use of your personal information at any time by deleting your account on the Service or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@iperceptions.com">privacy@iperceptions.com</a>. However, withdrawing your consent will prevent you from having access to the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                iPerceptions is not responsible for the privacy policies and content of any website to which our Site links. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these sites, as they will differ from ours.
            </p>
            <p>
                iPerceptions uses all reasonable precautions to keep secure any information we collect as part of our secure network. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control.
            </p>
            <h2>Integrity</h2>
            <p>
                iPerceptions collects and stores personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this statement. We make the necessary to ensure that we only collect, store and process such personal information that is needed to provide or improve our service offering. We take steps to ensure that the personal information we use is accurate, complete, and current, but it is ultimately the users that are in a position to allow us achieving that goal and by updating or correcting their personal information whenever necessary.
            </p>
            <h2>Accessing and updating</h2>
            <p>
                We take reasonable steps to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law. For so doing, we will ask individuals to identify themselves as well as the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests. In any case, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require disproportionate efforts on our part.
            </p>
            <h2>Information security</h2>
            <p>
                iPerceptions takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized disclosure or destruction of data, including any personal information collected and stored on its infrastructure. These include internal monitoring of our processes, practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
                We restrict access to personal information only to our employees, contractors and agents who need to access or know that information in order to develop, operate or improve our service offering. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
            </p>
            <h2>Changes</h2>
            <p>
                If iPerceptions decides to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement on our Site homepage and other places we deem appropriate so our users are aware of what information we collect and how we use it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy statement under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use your personal and contact information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will obtain your consent prior to this new use.
            </p>
            <h2>Sharing Information</h2>
            <p>
                Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with an appropriate law enforcement investigation, current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our web site.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may enter into discussions or negotiations with a third party (anywhere in the world) regarding the sale of all (or substantially all) of iPerceptions’ business or the acquisition of a controlling interest in iPerceptions’ share capital. Since customer information and data would normally be a part of such a transaction, iPerceptions reserves the right to transfer any information you submit and we retain to that third party as part of due diligence activities or to complete the transaction.
            </p>
            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
            <p>
