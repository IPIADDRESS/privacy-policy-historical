<p><strong>2.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">DEFINITIONS</span>.</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of this Policy:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a)  “Personally Identifiable Information”, or “PII”, is defined as any piece or<br>
collection of information or data that can be used to identify an individual, or can<br>
be related, whether processed or unprocessed, to an individual to find personal<br>
characteristics, preferences, or other private information which would reveal their<br>
identity;<br>
b)  “Confidential Information” is defined as any piece or collection of information or<br>
data that could reveal commercially or personally sensitive information about an<br>
organization, corporation, business, or individual which, if revealed, could cause<br>
irreparable harm to that organization, corporation, business, or individual.</p>
<p><strong>2.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">GENERAL POLICIES REGARDING INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USAGE</span>.</strong></p>
<p>Cardinal Path takes their visitors’, users’, and clients’ privacy extremely seriously, and considers it an essential part of their commitment to corporate integrity and responsibility to ensure that Personally Identifiable Information and Confidential Information, is safeguarded, kept secure, and never used for purposes other than those which were explicitly stated and consented to at the time of collection.</p>
<p>Cardinal Path does not and will not create software, adapt other software, or otherwise take any action that will facilitate the collection of Personally Identifiable Information or Confidential Information from its visitors without informing the visitor that the information is being collected and the reason and/or purpose for the collection of the information, and acquiring the visitor’s consent to collect and use such information in the manner so described.  Where such a purpose is stated, Cardinal Path will not use the collected Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than that stated in advance of the collection of that information.  Cardinal Path understands that the usage of information for a purpose other than that stated, and upon whose basis consent was originally given, shall be considered not to have been consented to by the organization, corporation, business, or individual which provided such information.</p>
<p>Any Personally Identifiable Information or Confidential Information collected by Cardinal Path with the visitor’s consent will be secured and safeguarded according to digital analytics industry best-practices, and will not be made generally available.</p>

<p><strong>3.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">POLICIES REGARDING INFORMATION COLLECTION SPECIFIC TO INDIVIDUAL PLATFORMS OR TOOLS</span>.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a)  <em>Google Analytics</em> is a web-based service which assists website owners and operators in learning about and understanding the usage patterns of visitors who use their websites by collecting information about which individual webpages were visited, how long users visited the website, which websites referred the most visitors, general geographic location of visitors and other similar anonymous statistics.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In order to distinguish one visit from another, Google Analytics may create several tracking cookies on a visitor’s computer which will expire after two years have passed since the initial visit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Google explicitly and expressly forbids the collection of Personally Identifiable Information in the Terms of Service for Google Analytics, and as such Cardinal Path has not attempted to make, has not made, and will never make modifications that would enable Google Analytics or any of the Cardinal Path Online Properties to collect any such information.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Google explicitly and expressly forbids the collection of Personally Identifiable Information in the Terms of Service for Google AdWords, and as such, Cardinal Path has not attempted to make, has not made, and will never make modifications that would enable Google AdWords or any of the Cardinal Path Online Properties to collect any such information.</p>
