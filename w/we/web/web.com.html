<br>
Web Internet LLC ("Web.com") is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy
Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose
mission is to enable individuals and organizations to establish
trusting relationships based on respect for personal identity and
information by promoting the use of fair information practices.&nbsp;
This privacy statement covers the site WWW.WEB.COM.&nbsp; Because this
Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to our users' privacy, it
has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy
practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. <br>
<br>
What personally identifiable information Web.com collects.<br>
<br>
What personally identifiable information third parties collect through
the Web site.<br>
<br>
What organization collects the information.<br>
<br>
How Web.com uses the information.<br>
<br>
With whom Web.com may share user information.<br>
<br>
What choices are available to users regarding collection, use and
distribution of the information.<br>
<br>
Those security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse
or alteration of information under Web.com control.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How users can correct any inaccuracies
in the information. </span><br>
If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they
should first contact Web.com <a href="http://support.web.com">Customer Service at www.Web.com</a>, or by
sending email to <a href="mailto:privacy@web.com">privacy@web.com</a>. If they do not receive
acknowledgment of their inquiry or their inquiry is not satisfactorily
addressed, they should then contact TRUSTe through the TRUSTe Watchdog
Dispute Resolution Process
(<a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php" target="_new">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>). TRUSTe will
serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve users concerns.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Information Collection and Use</span><br>
In some cases, Web.com is the sole owner of the information collected
on Web.com. Web.com collects information from our users at several
different points on our Web site.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Registration</span><br>
WEB.COM has entered into an agreement with an accredited domain name
registrar, Tucows,Inc. ("TUCOWS") to provide Customers with domain name
registration services, for any requests by Customer to WEB.COM to
register an Internet domain name. Web.com shares with TUCOWS only that
data which is necessary to complete the transaction requested by the
customer. During registration a user is required to give contact
information (such as name and email address). We use this information
to contact the user about services on our site in which he has
expressed interest.&nbsp; It is optional for the user to provide
demographic information (such as income level and gender), but
encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our
site. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Order</span><br>
We request information from the user on our order form. A user must
provide contact information (such as name, email, and mailing address)
and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration
date).&nbsp; This information is used for billing purposes and to fill
customer's orders.&nbsp; If we have trouble processing an order, the
information is used to contact the user. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Use of your Personal Information</span><br>
Web.com collects and uses your personal information to operate Web.com
and deliver the Services you have requested. These Services may include
the display of customized content and advertising based upon the
information we have collected. In order to provide Services in
conjunction with other Web.com products or services, personal
information collected on Web.com may be accessed and used by other
Web.com Services as necessary to provide such services. Any use of such
information within Web.com will remain subject to the limitations of
this privacy statement. <br>
<br>
We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may
send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters,
billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and
security announcements. Some Web.com services, including Web.com
Hosting and Web.com Mail, may send periodic member letters that are
considered part of the service. We may also occasionally send you
product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products
or services available from Web.com and its affiliates. <br>
<br>
Web.com does not sell, rent or lease its Web.com customer lists to
third parties. We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of
external business partners about a particular offering that may be of
interest to you. In those cases, your personal information (e-mail,
name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party.
We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race,
religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent. <br>
<br>
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our
behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings,
providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing
statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those
companies the personal information they need to deliver the service.
They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information
and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. <br>
<br>
Web.com may access and/or disclose your personal information if
required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action
is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with
legal process served on Web.com or the site; (b) protect and defend the
rights or property of Web.com, including the Web.com family of Web
sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal
safety of users of Web.com services or members of the public. <br>
<br>
Personal information collected on this site may be stored and processed
in the United States or any other country in which Web.com or its
affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using
this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of
your country. Web.com abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth
by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and
retention of data from the European Union. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Your California Privacy Rights </span><br>
In addition to the information provided elsewhere in this privacy
policy, the following applies only to California residents.<br>
<br>
Web.com may, from time to time, share your personally identifiable
information with unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing
purposes. As a California resident, you have a legal right to request
and receive in writing or by email the names and addresses of all such
third parties who received your personally identifiable information
during the previous calendar year and a list of the types of personally
identifiable information disclosed to such third parties. To request
such information, send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@web.com">privacy@web.com</a> or write to
California Privacy Information c/o Web.com, 6 Berkshire Blvd., Bethel,
CT 06801 or fax to (203)448-2022. We will not honor such request more
than once per calendar year.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cookies</span><br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to
information about the user.&nbsp; Usage of a cookie is in no way linked
to any personally identifiable information while on our site.&nbsp; We
use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.&nbsp; For the
session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply
terminates.&nbsp; A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on
the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent
cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file
directions. For further information on cookies, refer to
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie" target="_new">http://www.microsoft.com/ie</a>, or
<a href="http://browsers.netscape.com/browsers/main.tmpl" target="_new">http://browsers.netscape.com/browsers/main.tmpl</a>.<br>
<br>
Cookies are used on our website to track session-relevant information
during the registration process. Users of Web.com's WebMail service may
elect to use a persistent cookie to store their Web.com ID and Password
for faster logins in future sessions. By setting a cookie on our site,
users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby
saving time while on our site.&nbsp; If users reject the cookie, they
may still use our site.&nbsp; The only drawback to this is that the
user will be limited in some areas of our site. None of our business
partners use cookies on our site.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Third Party Advertising</span><br>
Web.com does not display Third Party Advertising on the Web.com site. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Log Files</span><br>
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files.&nbsp; This
includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet
service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time
stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site,
track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic
information for aggregate use.&nbsp; IP addresses, etc. are not linked
to personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</span><br>
We sometimes employ Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to track the
efficiency of various advertising campaigns. Clear gif usage is limited
to non-personal or aggregate analysis of traffic on the site. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Communications from the Site</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Offers and Updates</span><br>
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and
username. Established members will occasionally receive information on
products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for
the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive future
email communications with each communication. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Service Announcements</span><br>
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service
related announcement.&nbsp; For instance, if our service is temporarily
suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.&nbsp;
Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they
can deactivate their account.&nbsp; However, these communications are
not promotional in nature. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Customer Service</span><br>
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested
services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply
via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sharing Legal Disclaimer</span><br>
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to
disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a
good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a
current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on
our Web site. We DO NOT Share Personal Information with Third Parties,
except for Third Party Intermediaries, Service Providers (e.g. as
necessary to perform the service of our site) listed below. Third Party
Intermediaries<br>
We use outside credit card processing companies to bill users for goods
and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use
personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Service Providers</span><br>
We partner with TUCOWS, Inc. to provide Domain Name Registration
services.&nbsp; When the user signs up for these particular services,
we share name, mailing address, email address, and phone number as this
information is necessary for TUCOWS, Inc. to provide these
services.&nbsp; TUCOWS, Inc. is not allowed to use personally
identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these
services.&nbsp; However, please understand that as part of domain name
registration certain contact information is eventually published in the
public "whois" database according to appropriate rules and regulations
as put forth by ICANN.org. <br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Business Transitions</span><br>
In the event Web.com goes through a business transition, such as a
merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its
assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of
the assets transferred.&nbsp; Users will be notified via email, and/or
prominent notice on our Web site login pages for 30 days prior to a
change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a
result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable
information will be used in a manner materially different from that
stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent
with our notification of changes section.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Choice/Opt-out</span><br>
Users who no longer wish to receive any Web.com promotional
communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by
replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or the user
may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@web.com">privacy@web.com</a>. Users of our site are always
notified when their information is being collected by any outside
parties.&nbsp; We do this so our users can make an informed choice as
to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an
outside party.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Links</span><br>
This Web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that
we, Web.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such
other sites.&nbsp; We encourage our users to be aware when they leave
our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site
that collects personally identifiable information.&nbsp; This privacy
statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Surveys &amp; Contests</span><br>
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys
or contests.&nbsp; Participation in these surveys or contests is
completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not
to disclose this information.&nbsp; The requested information typically
includes contact information such as name and email address, and
demographic information, such as zip code.&nbsp; Contact information
will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.&nbsp; Anonymous
Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving
the use and satisfaction of this site.&nbsp; Users' personally
identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we
give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to
conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally
identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell-A-Friend</span><br>
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend
about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email
address.&nbsp; Web.com will automatically send the friend a one-time
email inviting them to visit the site.&nbsp; Web.com stores this
information only as necessary to send this one-time email and track the
function of our referral program. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Security</span><br>
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users'
information.&nbsp; When users submit sensitive information via the Web
site, their information is protected both online and off-line.<br>
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive
information, such as credit card number, that information is encrypted
and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry -
SSL.&nbsp; While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock
icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and
Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or
open, when users are just 'surfing'.&nbsp; To learn more about SSL,
follow this link <a href="http://www.verisign.com" target="_new">http://www.verisign.com</a>. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we
also do everything in our power to protect user-information
off-line.&nbsp; All of our users' information, not just the sensitive
information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.&nbsp; Only
employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for
example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are
granted access to personally identifiable information.&nbsp; Our
employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave
their desk.&nbsp; When they return, they must re-enter their password
to re-gain access to user information.&nbsp; Furthermore, ALL employees
are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.&nbsp; Every
quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are
notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and
what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected.&nbsp;
Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are
in a secure environment, behind a locked cage in a locked facility. If
users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can
send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@web.com">privacy@web.com</a>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Supplementation of Information</span><br>
In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users
it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with
information from 3rd party sources.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Credit Check</span><br>
For example, to determine if users qualify for payment terms, we may
use their name and social security number to request a credit
report.&nbsp; Once we determine a user's credit-worthiness, this
document is destroyed.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">IP Verification</span><br>
We use our proprietary software applications to verify a user's IP
Address to confirm purchases made online.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating
Personal Information </span><br>
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip
code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires
our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate
users' personally identifiable information. This can be done by opening
a Customer Support ticket at <a href="http://support.web.com">support.web.com</a>, or by calling Web.com
Customer Support at 203-448-2021.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Notification of Changes</span><br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes
to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem
appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we
collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we
disclose it.&nbsp; We will use information in accordance with the
privacy policy under which the information was collected.<br>
<br>
If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable
information in a manner materially different from that stated at the
time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a
choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different
manner.&nbsp; However, if users have opted out of all communication
with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not
be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new
manner.&nbsp; In addition, if we make any material changes in our
privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in
our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying
users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also
email users, who have opted to receive communications from us,
notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices<br>
<br>
