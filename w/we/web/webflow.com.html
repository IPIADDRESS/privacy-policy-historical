Information you provide to us</h4><p>When you register for the Service, we may ask for Personal Information such as your name, email address, or credit card or other billing information. You may also provide at your own discretion certain related information like your personal website name, social media websites, a list of your skills, the date you started using the Service and a description of you. Additionally, as users employ the Sites to create websites, the software continuously saves changes made by users with the server and will document items such as when users are working and saving changes, when a user last opened the designer, when sites are published, or when a user performs certain tasks.</p><p>We may also retain the contents of any messages you send to us or through the Service, and we may collect information you provide in user content that you post or upload to the Service (“User Content”).</p><p>Webflow may use Personal Information provided to operate, improve upon, and personalize the Service, for billing identification and authentication, to contact and communicate with you about the Service and your use of the Service, to support use of the Service, to send marketing materials (subject to your opt-out option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service. We may also combine your Personal Information with third-party analytics information to build a broader profile of our individual users so that we can serve you better and provide custom, personalized content and information. Additionally, we may use the Personal Information we collect for identification and authentication and fraud prevention, to analyze Site usage and improve the Service, for internal market research, troubleshooting problems, to enforce our Terms of Service, and as otherwise set forth in this Policy. Note that we will never email you to ask for your account information; if you receive such an email, please forward it to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:contact@webflow.com">contact@webflow.com</a>.</p><p>If you would like more information about our policy, please review our&nbsp;<a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p><p>We use financial information solely as authorized by you in accordance with the Service. While Webflow does not store your credit card information and will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all credit card and all other Personal Information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal and/or financial information stored therein, and you agree to hold Webflow harmless for any damages that may result therefrom.</p><h4>b. Information we may receive from and share with third parties</h4><p>We may now or in the future receive Personal Information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our Site or Service through a third-party connection or log-in or connect an application to Webflow, that third party you connected with may pass certain information about your use of its service to Webflow. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account, an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that third-party service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service.</p><p>Webflow may also share Personal Information with its third party service providers (such as its credit card processors and hosting partners) to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other service we use to operate the Service and maintain a high-quality user experience. We do not permit our service providers to use the Personal Information we share for their marketing purposes.</p><h4>c. Analytics information</h4><p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.
