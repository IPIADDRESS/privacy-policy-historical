<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>At Webmium we care about your privacy and the security of your personal data. We comply 
	applicable with applicable data privacy laws and regulations for your safety and security. 
	In the following we describe what information is collected and how we handle it. This policy 
	applies to all of the Webmium Products. Webmium is a service of Webmium, LLC.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Policy, please donâ€™t hesitate to 
	<a href="mailto:privacy@webmium.com">contact us</a> or write to Webmium, LLC, ATTN: 
	Privacy Department, 5348 Vegas Drive, Las Vegas, NV, USA.</p>
<p>Webmium collects, processes, and uses personal data of a user without further necessary 
	agreement only insofar as it is necessary for the establishment, fulfillment, and billing 
	of the contract.</p>
<p>Webmium is a Webmium website building and hosting service provided at 
	<a href="http://www.webmium.com">www.webmium.com</a> and its directly associated domains, 
	tools, services and applications that are operated by Webmium, LLC (collectively, "Webmium" 
	or "Services").</p>
<p>This "Privacy Policy" explains what information we gather from our users and how we use it. 
	By using or accessing our Services, you are accepting the practices described in this 
	Privacy Policy. (Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meaning set forth in our
	<a href="http://webmium.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>).</p>
<p>Webmium is not intended for children under 13 years of age. Consistent with the Federal 
	Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), we will never knowingly gather 
	or use personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13, and we do not 
	allow anyone under the age of 13 to register on Webmium.</p>

<h2>What information does Webmium gather?</h2>
<p>Webmium gathers and stores three types of information about users that are subject 
	to our Privacy Policy:</p>

<h3>Information users provide to us:</h3>
<p>These are voluntary submissions made when creating an account on Webmium or through your 
	use of the Services, such as your name, date of birth, location and email address provided 
	during registration, Content posted, or payment information provided during purchases. Please 
	understand that when you sign into Webmium or post Content, your information is not anonymous to us.</p>

<h3>Information we collect when you interact with Webmium:</h3>
<p>We keep track of the actions you take on Webmium, such as adding an application, or posting 
	Content. Also, when you access our Services, we may collect information about your access method 
	(such as hardware and software attributes), location, IP address, and pages you visit. In addition, 
	we store certain information from your browser using "cookies". (For more on cookies, please see 
	the section <a href="#toc-what-are-cookies">What are cookies?</a>)</p>

<h3>Information we receive from third parties:</h3>
<p>We do not own or operate the third-party applications, user Webmium websites and other services 
	offered that you may use or interact with through Webmium (collectively, "Webmium-enhanced" 
	applications, Webmium websites and services). Whenever you visit, use or interact with a 
	Webmium -enhanced application, Webmium website or service, we will receive information from 
	them, including information about actions you take and Content you post on that application, 
	Webmium website or service.</p>

<h2>Why does Webmium gather information about me?</h2>
<p>Webmium collects information in order to provide a safe, efficient and customized experience. 
	This information allows us to better tailor our content to users' needs and to help us better 
	understand the demographics of our audience. Webmium may use some of this information for 
	contacting you, customizing the content and advertising you view, improving our services, 
	conducting research, and providing anonymous reporting for clients. We only collect personally 
	identifiable information from you because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us in 
	order to enjoy certain Services.</p>

<h2>How will Webmium websites and Applications on Webmium treat my information?</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, we do not own or operate Webmium-enhanced applications, Webmium websites 
	and services. We take steps to ensure that providers of Webmium -enhanced applications, Webmium 
	websites and services use information that you share on Webmium in a manner consistent with your
	privacy settings and the terms of this Privacy Policy, but we cannot guarantee that they will follow 
	our rules. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with the privacy settings of your account, 
	as well as the settings and policies of the applications, Webmium sites and services that you visit, 
	add or use on Webmium. Here are some specific things to remember:</p>
<p>By visiting or becoming a Member of a Webmium site on Webmium , the Content and information you 
	provide during the registration process (including your email address) and other interactions with 
	the Webmium website may be accessed by the Webmium site Creator and their authorized representatives 
	and administrators, as well as any Application Developer whose Applications run on that Webmium website.</p>
<p>By adding or using an Application or a service provided by one of our affiliates or business 
	partners, the information you provide in the interactions with that Application or service may 
	be accessed by the respective Application Developer, affiliate or business partner and their 
	authorized representatives.</p>
<p>When you post information on a Webmium website, that information is subject to that Webmium 
	website's privacy settings and privacy policy, which may change from time to time.</p>
<p>Publicly available information may be accessed by everyone on the Internet, including third-party 
	search engines that may index, cache and store that information.</p>
<p>You should always review the policies of third party Webmium websites, applications and services 
	to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they use information you share with them. 
	Any information you share with them is at your own risk. If you find an application, Webmium website 
	or service that violates our rules, you should report the violation to us, and we reserve the right 
	to take action as we deem appropriate without assuming any obligation or liability to do so.</p>

<h2 id="toc-what-are-cookies">What are cookies?</h2>
<p>Webmium may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. These 
	cookies help us make Webmium easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect 
	both you and Webmium. For example, a cookie may be used to store or "remember" your 
	Member login information (but not your password) so that you are not required to manually 
	log into the site at every visit. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your 
	browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use some of our Services.</p>
<p>Our advertisers and partners may also set cookies through our Services. For more information, 
	please see the section "What about third party advertisers and links?"</p>

<h2>Google Analytics</h2>
<p>Webmium.com uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). 
	Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the 
	website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your 
	use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on 
	servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your 
	use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other 
	services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information 
	to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information 
	on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. 
	You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however 
	please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. 
	By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and 
	for the purposes set out above.</p>

<h2>What about third party advertisers and links?</h2>
<p>In the course of serving advertisements on Webmium, a third-party advertiser may place or 
	recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Additionally, some links from Webmium may lead to 
	Webmium websites operated by other companies. While these Webmium websites and advertisements 
	may be co-branded with our name or logo, they are not operated or maintained by us. We do not control 
	these cookies and users of Webmium Services should check the privacy policy of the relevant 
	advertiser to understand whether and how it uses cookies. Webmium is not responsible for Webmium 
	websites operated by third parties that are linked to by any of our sites. Ads appearing on this 
	Webmium website, Webmium, and sites hosted by Webmium may be delivered to you by Google Ad Manager, 
	DoubleClick, or other advertising partners. Information about your visits to this site, such as the 
	number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address or other personal information), 
	is used to serve ads to you.</p>

<h2>How secure is my information?</h2>
<p>Webmium uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural measures to safeguard 
	personally identifiable information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, 
	disclosure or modification. We limit access to personal information about you to employees whom we 
	believe reasonably need that information to provide support, products, or services to you or to 
	fulfill their roles within our organization.</p>
<p>Although we have established and maintain security procedures to protect your personally 
	identifiable information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. 
	We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot 
	guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information 
	you share on Webmium will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party 
	circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on Webmium. You can reduce these risks 
	by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different 
	passwords for different services, and using up-to-date antivirus software.</p>
<p>Please <a href="mailto:privacy@webmium.com">report</a> any security violations to us.</p>

<h2>How private is the Content I upload?</h2>
<p>Any Content uploaded or created using our Services and posted on a Webmium website are by 
	default hosted for the public and are thus publicly accessible.</p>
<p>Please note that even if you do not publish links to Content or submit links to a search 
	engine, individuals or search engines may discover and link to your Content by data-mining, 
	guessing the address, spidering sites, or other methods.</p>

<h2>What control do I have over my information?</h2>
<p>As a registered member, you may modify or update your personal account information at any 
	time by logging into your account and (a) accessing the Settings area for each Webmium website 
	you have created, and (b) accessing the Manage Profile area for each Webmium website you have 
	joined by clicking on the corresponding Edit Profile link on your Dashboard page. You may also 
	remove the Webmium website(s) you may have created on Webmium at any time by logging into your 
	account and clicking on the corresponding "Delete Site" link on your Dashboard page. Should you 
	desire to do so, you may also delete and close your Webmium account at any time by 
	<a href="mailto:webmium@webmium.com">contacting</a> us. Note that removed or deleted information 
	may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time.</p>

<h2>How is information shared?</h2>
<p>Webmium will not share your personally identifiable information with others except as described 
	herein with regards to sharing with Webmium -enhanced applications, Webmium websites and services 
	and in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is reasonably necessary to offer 
	the Services, legally required, or permitted by you. For example, we may provide information 
	to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third 
	parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the Services at a co-location facility for 
	servers, to register your domain name, to send out email updates about Webmium, to provide you 
	with email functionality for your domain, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, 
	to process payments for products or services, or to provide search results or links 
	(including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, 
	our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time.</p>
<p>Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement 
	reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the 
	Webmiumâ€”specified purposes. We may store personal information in locations outside the 
	direct control of Webmium (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). 
	Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose personal information to 
	any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal 
	requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received 
	by Webmium , whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the 
	<a href="http://webmium.com/terms">Webmium Terms of Service</a> or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect 
	the safety or rights of members of the public or users of the Services. Webmium reserves the 
	right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to 
	that information as a result of the sale of Webmium or substantially all of its assets to 
	that successor in interest. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate 
	divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.</p>

<h2>How am I notified of changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may change this Privacy Policy pursuant to the procedures outlined in our <a href="http://webmium.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>. Unless stated otherwise, our current 
	Privacy Policy applies to all information we have about you and your account. If we make changes 
	to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by publication here.</p>

<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy may change. Of course, we will not reduce your rights without your 
	explicit consent. All of the Policy changes will be posted on this page. If the changes are 
	significant we will provide a more significant notice (i.e. email notification). If you 
	don't agree with the changes of our privacy statement, it is possible to beg to differ within 
	one month. After this period of time, the changes are considered to be accepted. Please enter your 
	objection via <a href="mailto:privacy@webmium.com">E-Mail</a> or write to Webmium, LLC, ATTN: 
	Privacy Department, 5348 Vegas Drive, Las Vegas, NV, USA.</p>
