To check when SSL is active, note the following:</p><p>1. Internet Explorer : right click your mouse and select 'properties'. The URL will display for the page you are viewing as 'https' which denotes that the page is secured / SSL is in effect. 2. Netscape : for version 6.0 and above, those pages that are secured will result in the padlock in the bottom right corner of your browser to close. For earlier versions, the padlock may not change, but, you will get a security alert that you are moving into or out of secured pages providing you have configured your settings to notify you accordingly. To configure those settings, do the following: - select "Communicator" at the top of your browser - select "Tools" - select "Security Info" - select "Navigator" then tick the following boxes - "Entering an encrypted site" - "Leaving an encrypted site" Also, ensure you enable SSL versions 2 and 3 on the same screen.</p><p>Note, only those pages that require you to insert private information are secured.</p><p>To make a Websure claim, <a href="mailto:%20mtyrrell@safetrade.com.au">click here</a> to email SafeTrade and ensure you indicate your booking date and booking reference number.</p><p><strong><img alt="" height="70" id="policy" src="/site/images/privacy_header.gif" width="783"></strong></p><p>This privacy policy statement has been made in accordance with amendments to the Federal Government Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000 (New Privacy Laws) which took effect from 21 December 2001.
