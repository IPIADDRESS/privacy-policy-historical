		      Web-Source.net strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet
		      technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We
		      may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street
		      address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We
		      will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third
		      party. Period. <br>
		      <br>
		      <b>How we gather information from users</b><br>
		      <br>
		      How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting,
		      the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided.
		      For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for
		      access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such
		      as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when
		      you participate in sweepstakes and contests and message boards, and other
		      interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, Web-Source.net also collects
		      information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may
		      be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your
		      Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold
		      information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your
		      user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information
		      each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a
		      particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional
		      technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain
		      cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by
		      setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be
		      unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter
		      your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s
		      features according to your preferences. <br>
		      <br>
		      <b>What we do with the information we collect</b><br>
		      <br>
		      Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and
		      deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy
		      and do not share your information with anyone. <br>
		      <br>
		      Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you)
		      may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your
		      usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help
		      enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most
		      or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally
		      be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information
		      does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow
		      anyone to identify you individually. <br>
		      <br>
		      We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on Web-Source.net
		      to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences;
		      our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by
		      Web-Source.net and other topics we think you might find of interest. <br>
		      <br>
		      Personally Identifiable Information collected by Web-Source.net may also
		      be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration,
		      troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of
		      sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third
		      parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our
		      Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use
		      your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time
		      as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner
		      with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information
		      may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information
		      in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably
		      required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you
		      may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it
		      appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice
		      prior to disclosure in such cases. <br>
		      <br>
		      <b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b><br>
		      <br>
		      Web-Source.net expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect
		      the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including
		      our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible
		      through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies
		      and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link to,
		      or view as part of a frame on a Web-Source.net page, certain content that
		      is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through Web-Source.net
		      you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features,
		      contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. Web-Source.net is not
		      responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should
		      check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing
		      information on a feature or page operated by a third party. <br>
		      <br>
		      While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties
		      may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your
		      preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our
		      advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable
		      the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement
		      before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated
		      by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.
		      Web-Source.net does not control the use of this technology by third parties
		      or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies
		      of such third parties. <br>
		      <br>
		      You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable
		      Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed
		      publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge
		      and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties.
		      Such activities are beyond the control of Web-Source.net and this policy.
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      <b>Children</b><br>
		      <br>
		      Web-Source.net does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable
		      Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If
		      we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation
		      of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe
		      Web-Source.net has any information from or about anyone under 13, please
		      contact us at the address listed below. <br>
		      <br>
		      <b>Contacting Us</b><br>
		      <br>
		      We can be reached by contacting:<br>

		      <b>Changes to this Policy</b><br>
		      <br>
		      Web-Source.net reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please
		      check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site
		      following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those
		      changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will
		      be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information
		      was collected. <br>
		      <br>
		      <b>Governing law</b><br>
		      <br>
		      This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Ohio law. If a dispute
		      arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with the help
		      of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: Delaware, Ohio.
		      Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with the mediation
		      will be shared equally by each of us. <br>
		      <br>
		      If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through
		      mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration at the following
		      location: Delaware, Ohio, under the rules of the American Arbitration
		      Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered
		      in any court with jurisdiction to do so. <br>
		      <br>
		      Web-Source.net is controlled, operated and administered entirely within Ohio.
		      This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do
		      not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
