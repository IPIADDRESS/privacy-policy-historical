requirements of the act.&nbsp; In summary, you must presume that we
collect electronic information from all visitors.&nbsp; This is not
usually personally identifiable.&nbsp; If you purchase a product or
service via this website (and thereby become covered by the Act), the
purchase agreement you electronically sign prior to purchase allows the
website to collect and archive all the personal information you provide
and to transmit and/or transfer that personal information to third
parties.&nbsp; There is no way you can modify this information and you
have no right to do so.&nbsp; Under the terms of the purchase
agreement, you have no right to view or receive any information about
our database.&nbsp; In the event that the website, under advice of
counsel agrees to divulge information, the requesting party must submit
whatever information is demanded by the website in insure that the
website is releasing information to the correct party.&nbsp; Other
provisions of the OPPA may exempt this website from complying.&nbsp;
While we take measures to ensure that outside parties do not have
access to any information we have about you, we do not warranty that
outside parties will not breach our system and thus have access to your
information.&nbsp; (You should know that merchant service providers do
not allow us access to your credit card information.)&nbsp; This
Privacy Policy also is subject to change without notice.&nbsp; You are
required to read it prior to using the website.&nbsp; By interacting
with the website you agree to the terms and conditions of the Privacy
Policy.&nbsp; By using the website or purchasing a product through this
website, you waive the right to use state or federal court systems to
address complaints and, instead, agree to use the American Arbitration
Association located in a city and county specified herein.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">This
website routinely collects information about its visitors, subscribers,
members, and customers.&nbsp; This information is obtained in various
ways, such as:</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION'</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">Registration
means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active,
positive steps to communicate information to this website.&nbsp; This
can include pages or 'pop ups' where you register for a newsletter or
subscribe to a mailing list; it can include your participation in
visitor surveys; it can include requesting information from the website
via email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining an affiliate
program or other membership organization, paid or unpaid; it may be
from ordering a product.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">Occasionally
complete credit card information may be provided to the website via fax
or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant service
processing.&nbsp; This information is kept at the highest level of
security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service
provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">ONLINE ORDERING</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">Online
ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart
services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master
Card provides information to the website but does not provide complete
credit card numbers.&nbsp; In the process of online ordering, the
customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone
number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member
password.&nbsp; You should consider all this information available to
the website.&nbsp; This information is used to deliver the product, but
under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for general
solicitation purposes.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">Website

conditions:&nbsp; one, they give their permission for contact by the
website; two, they are subject to any ‘submission’ provisions of the
Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; While

to the website's general solicitation database.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">If
you are a customer and send an email to the website, or if you
communicate with the site by phone or mail, the website collects
information about your communication and by communicating with the site
you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise
use any information collected as the site sees fit.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">Any communication which, in its sole discretion, the site deems to be a testimonial, may be publicized for commercial purposes.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS, OR SITE ADVERTISERS</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">Visitors
