If you do not accept these terms, you have no right to visit this site and you are fraudulently using this site.</font></p><p><font face="arial">&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="arial">A NOTE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS (ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 –OPPA)</font></p><p><font face="arial">It is the intent of the Privacy Policy to comply with the California Act.&nbsp; Various provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address requirements of the act.&nbsp; In summary, you must presume that we collect electronic information from all visitors.&nbsp; This is not usually personally identifiable.&nbsp;

There is no way you can modify this information and you have no right to do so.&nbsp; Under the terms of the purchase agreement, you have no right to view or receive any information about our database.&nbsp;

Other provisions of the OPPA may exempt this website from complying.&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="arial">While we take measures to ensure that outside parties do not have access to any information we have about you, we do not warranty that outside parties will not breach our system and thus have access to your information.&nbsp; (You should know that merchant service providers do not allow us access to your credit card information.)&nbsp; This Privacy Policy also is subject to change without notice.&nbsp; You are required to read it prior to using the website.&nbsp; By interacting with the website you agree to the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy.&nbsp; By using the website or purchasing a product through this ebsite, you waive the right to use state or federal court systems to address complaints and, instead, agree to use the American Arbitration Association located in a city and county specified herein.</font></p><p><font face="arial">&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="arial">&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="arial">ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED</font></p><p><font face="arial">This website routinely collects information about its visitors, subscribers, members, and customers.&nbsp; This information is obtained in various ways, such as:</font></p><p><font face="arial">&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="arial">VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ‘REGISTRATION’</font></p><p><font face="arial">Registration means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active, positive steps to communicate information to this website.&nbsp; This can include pages or ‘pop ups’ where you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can include your participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting information from the website via email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining an affiliate program or other membership organization, paid or unpaid; it may be from ordering a product.</font></p><p><font face="arial">&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="arial">Occasionally complete credit card information may be provided to the website via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant service processing.&nbsp; This information is kept at the highest level of security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer.</font></p><p><font face="arial">&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="arial">ONLINE ORDERING</font></p><p><font face="arial">Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master Card provides information to the website but does not provide complete credit card numbers.&nbsp; In the process of online ordering, the customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member password.&nbsp; You should consider all this information available to the website.&nbsp; This information is used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes.</font></p><p><font face="arial">&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="arial">VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES</font></p><p><font face="arial">Website visitors who wish to communicate with the website do so under two conditions:&nbsp; one, they give their permission for contact by the website; two, they are subject to any ‘submission’ provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; While your email address may or may not be used to solicit you, it is added to the website’s general solicitation database.</font></p><p><font face="arial">&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="arial">CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS</font></p><p><font face="arial">If you are a customer and send an email to the website, or if you communicate with the site by phone or mail, the website collects information about your communication and by communicating with the site you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise use any information collected as the site sees fit.</font></p><p><font face="arial">Any communication which, in its sole discretion, the site deems to be a testimonial, may be publicized for commercial purposes.</font></p><p><font face="arial">&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="arial">INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS, OR SITE ADVERTISERS</font></p><p><font face="arial">Visitors clicking on banners or pop-ups or hyperlinked advertising, appearing on this website must assume that information is being collected about them.&nbsp;
