website, whether intentionally or unintentionally, whether solicited or
unsolicited, are described herein as "Visitors" and are parties to this
Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Subscribers to lists or Newsletters are referred
to herein as "Subscribers" and are parties to the Privacy Policy.&nbsp;
Persons who join an organization or marketing endeavor (e.g.
"affiliates") promoted by this website are called "Members" herein and
are covered by this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Finally, anyone who orders,
attempts to order, or receives a product sold (recipients) or
advertised on or delivered from this website, even at no cost, is
called a "Customer" herein and is subject to this Privacy Policy not
only by passive acceptance, but by virtue of the Purchase Agreement
contract.&nbsp; The website, its agents, owners, operators, and
employees are referred to collectively herein as "Website," "Site,"
and/or "Seller".</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">PERSONS EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE ARE STILL COVERED</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">In
the event that a person excluded from this website because of the Terms
of Use or from denial of service by the website, who nonetheless
unlawfully views this site, that person remains subject to the terms of
this Privacy Policy and is in violation of the Terms of Use.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">PERSONS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">This
website is not lawfully accessible to persons under the age of 18 or
who are otherwise covered by the provisions of the Child Online Privacy
Act of 1998 (COPA).&nbsp; If you are under the age of 18 you must leave
this site immediately.&nbsp; Fraudulent use of this website may make
you subject to civil or criminal sanctions.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">VIEWING AND/OR USE AND/OR COMMUNICATION IS CONSTRUED AS ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">Acceptance
of the terms of this Privacy Policy is a portion of the consideration
required for your right to visit the website.&nbsp; If you do not
accept these terms, you have no right to visit this site and you are
fraudulently using this site.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">A NOTE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS (ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 --OPPA)</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">It
is the intent of the Privacy Policy to comply with the California
Act.&nbsp; Various provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address
requirements of the act.&nbsp; In summary, you must presume that we
collect electronic information from all visitors.&nbsp; This is not
usually personally identifiable.&nbsp; If you purchase a product or
service via this website (and thereby become covered by the Act), the
purchase agreement you electronically sign prior to purchase allows the
website to collect and archive all the personal information you provide
and to transmit and/or transfer that personal information to third
parties.&nbsp; There is no way you can modify this information and you
have no right to do so.&nbsp; Under the terms of the purchase
agreement, you have no right to view or receive any information about
our database.&nbsp; In the event that the website, under advice of
counsel agrees to divulge information, the requesting party must submit
whatever information is demanded by the website in insure that the
website is releasing information to the correct party.&nbsp; Other
provisions of the OPPA may exempt this website from complying.&nbsp;

While we take measures to ensure that outside parties do not have
access to any information we have about you, we do not warranty that
outside parties will not breach our system and thus have access to your
information.&nbsp; (You should know that merchant service providers do
not allow us access to your credit card information.)&nbsp; This
Privacy Policy also is subject to change without notice.&nbsp; You are
required to read it prior to using the website.&nbsp; By interacting
with the website you agree to the terms and conditions of the Privacy
Policy.&nbsp; By using the website or purchasing a product through this
website, you waive the right to use state or federal court systems to
address complaints and, instead, agree to use the American Arbitration
Association located in a city and county specified herein.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">This
website routinely collects information about its visitors, subscribers,
members, and customers.&nbsp; This information is obtained in various
ways, such as:</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION'</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">Registration
means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active,
positive steps to communicate information to this website.&nbsp; This
can include pages or 'pop ups' where you register for a newsletter or
subscribe to a mailing list; it can include your participation in
visitor surveys; it can include requesting information from the website
via email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining an affiliate
program or other membership organization, paid or unpaid; it may be
from ordering a product.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">Occasionally
complete credit card information may be provided to the website via fax
or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant service
processing.&nbsp; This information is kept at the highest level of
security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service
provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">ONLINE ORDERING</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">Online
ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart
services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master
Card provides information to the website but does not provide complete
credit card numbers.&nbsp; In the process of online ordering, the
customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone
number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member
password.&nbsp; You should consider all this information available to
the website.&nbsp; This information is used to deliver the product, but
under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for general
solicitation purposes.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">Website
visitors who wish to communicate with the website do so under two
conditions:&nbsp; one, they give their permission for contact by the
website; two, they are subject to any ‘submission’ provisions of the
Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; While
your email address may or may not be used to solicit you, it is added
to the website's general solicitation database.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">If
you are a customer and send an email to the website, or if you
communicate with the site by phone or mail, the website collects
information about your communication and by communicating with the site
you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise
use any information collected as the site sees fit.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">Any communication which, in its sole discretion, the site deems to be a testimonial, may be publicized for commercial purposes.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS, OR SITE ADVERTISERS</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">Visitors
clicking on banners or pop-ups or hyperlinked advertising, appearing on
this website must assume that information is being collected about
them.&nbsp; This site is not responsible for the use of information
collected in such a fashion.&nbsp; Visitors must assume that (1)
information will be collected, (2) that ‘cookies’ will usually be
placed on their hard drive, (3) that website does not have any control
over what happens with this information, (4) that website takes no
responsibility over the accuracy or content of advertisers, (5) that
website is not responsible for downloads from third party advertisers
that contain viruses or worms or other computer code that causes their

that the advertiser collects.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM REFERRING EMAIL OR REFERRING URLS</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">If
you send a friend an email from this site or if you send the url or one
of our web pages to a friend, you must assume that some data is
collected about your IP address or your email address and that of your
friend.&nbsp; You must assume that referred emails or web pages may
appear to come from your email.&nbsp; You must accept fully
responsibility for referring pages or email to a friend and agree to
indemnify this site for any damage, intentional or unintentional that
results from said referrals.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VOLUNTARY VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER OR CUSTOMER SURVEYS</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unless
otherwise specified in the survey, you must assume that any information
provided to the website as part of a survey in which you participate
may be used for general solicitation for commercial purposes and that
such information will be shared with joint venture partners,
affiliates, marketing organization or used by the site itself for
product design or solicitation purposes.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br></div><p style="text-align: center;"><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br></font></p><div style="text-align: left;"><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ELECTRONIC MEANS AND 'COOKIES'</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many
websites, including this one, collect information about your computer,
your email address, your IP address.&nbsp; You must assume that your
web-viewing or web-use activity is monitored, tracked, and information
collected.&nbsp; This information is not usually of a personal nature,
but it may help define your viewing habits and product preferences even
though the website may or may not have any idea who you are.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Cookies"

can be used to electronically gather information about you.&nbsp;

Again, it may or may not be personal information, but it is information
and by using this site you are expressly giving permission to use
'cookies' and to use the information gathered from their use to benefit
you.&nbsp; You also give permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and
use any information collected for product design, product offers to
you, and general commercial solicitation purposes by this site or joint
venture partners, affiliates, and marketing organizations.</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">HOW INFORMATION MAY BE USED</font><br><br><font face="Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
use of information as described below may or may not be how information
that is collected is customarily used by this site.&nbsp; While actual
