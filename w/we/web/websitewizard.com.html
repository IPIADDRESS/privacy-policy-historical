ordered, arrange the website in the most customer friendly way, communicate special offers and featured items, 
and/or respond to your questions and suggestions.
</p><p>
In the case of an agreement, personal information includes data that identifies you as the specific individual, 
i.e. your name, email address, phone number, geographical address, and/or company name and address. 
This information is used to complete the account application process, customer's information request, 
and/or to verify the validity of the request, and to proceed payment.
</p><p>
We will use this information solely for performing Services and processing payments for those Services that you ordered.
</p><p>
<strong>Implix collects only personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily registering to our WebsiteWizard Service.

never use your email address to send you any unsolicited message or

</p><p>

</p>
<p>
When you request information or other Services from us, we use your email address and any other information you give us to provide you with the information and/or other Services that you requested, until you ask us to stop (using the 'unsubscribe' instructions provided with each email, and/or on the site where you signed up, and/or as we otherwise provide), or until the information or Service is no longer available.

</p><p>

<h3>
	Your Recipient's Private Information Policy
</h3>
<p>
Implix recognizes the importance of respecting the privacy of those who decided to 
entrust their sensitive information with you. We make every effort to safeguard their security. 
Implix will never use the information about the recipients you collect within our Services to send 
any information other than expressly provided by you, nor will we share it with or sell it to anyone else for such use.

<h3>
	Information Security
</h3>
<p>
We believe that keeping personal information secure is one of our most significant responsibilities. 
</p><p>
We restrict access to personal information about you to those employees and others who need to know that information to assist us in our business, or to provide products or Services to you.
We safeguard personal information, according to the established security standards and procedures, by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to the personal data information. 
</p><p>
When we request our Customers to enter sensitive information, such as their name, geographical address, email address, and a credit card number, it is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry, SSL, and processed through a reputable payment processor <a href="http://www.paylane.com">PayLane</a>. While on the secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon at the bottom of web browsers, e.g. Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer, becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open, when you are just 'surfing'.
</p>
<p>
All of our Customers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g. our billing clerk or a Customer Service Representative) are personally granted access to.
</p>

<h3>

</p>
<p>
We cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted over the Internet and through servers that are out of our control. We strive to protect your personal information but Implix cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to our website or Services. Any data transmissions you make over the Internet are done so at your own risk. Once we receive the data transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its security and privacy on our systems.
