<h3>
	Cookies
</h3>
<p>
Similar to other commercial websites, the technology called "cookies" may be
used to provide you with tailored information. A cookie is a small piece of
data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your
hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. You may be able to set your
browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. Our cookies collect general
information that enhances our ability to serve you and measure the utility of
our website.
</p>
<h3>
	Information Security
</h3>
<p>
We believe that keeping personal information secure is one of our most
significant responsibilities. We restrict access to Personal Information about
you to those employees and others who need to know that information to assist
us in our business, or to provide products or services to you. We safeguard
personal information, according to established security standards and
procedures, by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards for
the information.
</p><p>
When we request customers to enter sensitive information (such as the credit
card number), it is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software
in the industry -- SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the
lock icon at the bottom of web browsers, such as Netscape Navigator and
Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open,
when you are just 'surfing'.
</p><p>
All of our customers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned
above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to
perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk, or a customer service
representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
