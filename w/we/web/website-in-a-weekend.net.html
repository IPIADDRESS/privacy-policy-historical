You many not think that personal development has anything to do with becoming a successful blogger, but it does. Too many people let fear stop them from making their online dreams a reality. <p></p>
<p><img src="http://website-in-a-weekend.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Overcoming-Fear-Webresizer_small.jpg" align="right"><br>
If this is you, here's something which might help.</p>
<p>My good friend Lisa (who has been featured here on Website In A Weekend) and a couple of other bloggers put together a unique collection of articles, podcasts and other bonuses all designed for one purpose--and one purpose only--to help you get out of your own way so that you can grasp the success you desire. It wasn't until Lisa acted in the face of her fears, that her blog began to take off.</p>
<p>So, head over to her blog and take a peek at <a href="http://gettingtozen.com/website-in-a-weekend/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-widget','http://gettingtozen.com']);">Overcoming Fear: Sticking it to What's holding You Back</a>.

The easiest way to start building traffic is to create high quality content, get that content indexed by search engines (see related articles here), and let time take it’s course. Longevity is important on the internet, and the longer your content is on the web, the better search engines are going to like your website.

There are many other ways to build traffic, including paid advertisement, organic backlinking by people inspired by your content, backlinking from comments and posts you have made on other forums, and many other ways.

But in the long term, engineers from Google assert that quality content rises to the top. You may be able to get top search results without quality content, but you won’t keep top billing without quality content.">Building Traffic</a> (55)

You’re only as good as the last piece people read. Fortunately, creating high quality content isn’t that difficult to learn. However, it is a skill, and it does take practice. On the internet, your primary “readers” are, initially, search engine crawlers. So your content has to satisfy their demands as well (WordPress makes this easy, as noted by Google engineer Matt Cutts).

Plugins are the most common ways to extend WordPress capabilities, and there are thousands of plugins to choose from.

For those wanting to go deeper, writing custom plugins is not difficult, and there’s even a book just published: WordPress Plugin Development Beginner’s Guide. The author, Vladimir Prelovac, is an expert WordPress developer and a great theme designer.

For those wanting to get to the bottom of all this WordPress stuff, the source code is Free Software, and you may examine it, change it, learn from it however you will. Fortunately, WordPress is founded on PHP and MySQL, which are relatively easy to learn to program, even for non-programmers.

Check out the articles on recommended plugins here on Website In A Weekend, and watch for upcoming articles on plugin development and WordPress core tweaks.">Extending WordPress</a> (45)

Marketers are able to rapidly switch copy, which is useful for introducing new products, and for testing existing sales copy to determine best conversion rates.
The money-making capabilities of WordPress have hardly been exploited, so watch for more articles on this topic in the future.

For example, you can Add a Twitter Widget to Your New Blog and have each post show as a tweet automatically.

Other tools include Facebook and Digg, which allow to reach a much larger audience than you would through simple, organic search. In fact, as explained in How To Make It Easy To Catch People Stealing Your Articles, social media can help make sure your article aren’t totally ripped off without credit.">Social Media</a> (3)

There has been a lot of technology developed in the last 15 years, but I firmly believe that WordPress is as much a “game changer” as Google has been, and as Twitter is shaping up to be. It’s not just the ease of use which WordPress excels at. Compared to previous web development platforms, and with current competitors such as Drupal and Joomla, for it’s powerful capabilities WordPress is incredibly easy to operate and maintain:
Upgrades for the main platform are now automatically delivered.
WordPress-hosted plugins are automatically updated
Plugins for backing up files and the database are a few clicks away, and backups can be easily stored via email.
In fact, maintaining WordPress is so easy many people operate several WordPress blogs.
Nevertheless, WordPress does require simple and systematic maintenance, which will be discussed in a future article.">Website Maintenance</a> (44)

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-8"><a href="http://website-in-a-weekend.net/category/website-security/" title="WordPress is incredibly secure considering the huge number of WordPress installations (over 15 million) and the size of the source code to WordPress. Part of this security results from WordPress being open source. While open source allows malicious hackers to examine WordPress for weakness, open source also allows programmers from around the world to learn the code and fix hacking exploits incredibly rapidly. The popularity of WordPress coupled with open source means that no matter hour of the day or night, someone, somewhere, is programming WordPress.

Making security even easier for you are a variety of plugins to check your WordPress installation, keep spammers from pillaging your comments, keep deadbeats from registering, and many more. More articles coming soon.">Website security</a> (9)
