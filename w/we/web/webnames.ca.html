WEBNAMES<sup>TM</sup> PRIVACY POLICY<br></h1>
<br>
This version in effect since <strong>18 June 2008</strong><br><br></center>
<p>Protecting your privacy is important to each of Webnames.ca Inc., Webnames Asia Inc. and Webnames Services Inc. (collectively, the <strong>"Webnames Group"</strong>).  This Policy explains how the members of the Webnames Group collect, use and disclose the personal and non-personal information you may provide while using their respective websites (collectively, the "Websites") and the services they provide (collectively, the <strong>"Services"</strong>).</p>

<ol>
<span class="bold">Your Consent</span>
<li>By using any of the Websites or the Services, or by submitting information to any member of the Webnames Group, you signify your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy and any applicable service agreement you have with any member of the Webnames Group, including the <i>Webnames.ca Terms of Use and Services Agreement and the Webnames Services Inc. Privacy Service Subscription Agreement</i> (collectively, the <strong>"Services Agreements"</strong>), which are available by clicking <a href="http://www.webnames.ca/content/webnames/webnames_privacyService.asp" class="bodylink" target="_blank">here</a>. If you do not consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy and the Services Agreements, you may not use the Websites or the Services.</li>

<br><br>
<span class="bold">Information Automatically Collected</span>

<li><span class="bold">Non-Personal Information:</span>Each of the Websites automatically collects certain non-personal information regarding Website users, such as the date and time they access the Website, the Internet address of the website from which they linked directly to the Website, the browser or operating system they are using, and the Website pages read and content accessed or downloaded.  This non-personal information is used for system administration purposes and to improve the Websites.  Non-personal information may be disclosed to other persons and permanently retained for future use.  If non-personal information is combined with personal information, then the non-personal information will be treated as personal information.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Cookies:</span>The Websites may use "cookies", a technology that installs a small amount of information on a Website user's computer to permit the Website to recognize future visits using that computer.  Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the Websites.  For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of the Website (so you do not have to enter your personal information every time), offer personalized web page content and information for your use, and otherwise facilitate your Website experience.  You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your ability to access or use certain features of the Websites.</li>

<br><br>
<span class="bold">Personal Information You Specifically Provide</span>
<li><span class="bold">Your Personal Information:</span>During your use of the Websites or the Services, you may be asked to voluntarily provide personal information (such as your personal name, email address, postal address, telephone number, fax number, and credit card details, login and password information).  If you choose not to provide certain requested personal information, you will not be able to use certain features of the Websites or use certain Services.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Use of Your Personal Information:</span>Each member of the Webnames Group uses your personal information for the following purposes and as otherwise permitted by applicable law:  (a) to contact and correspond with you regarding the Websites and the Services; (b) to bill you for the services requested by you and otherwise to administer your account; (c) to administer the Websites and the Services; and (d) as reasonably required by the rules, policies, procedures, and guidelines adopted and amended by domain name registration authorities from time to time.  Each member of the Webnames Group may develop a confidential profile for you, which will be used to provide services to you and facilitate your use of the Websites.  Additionally, each member of the Webnames Group may keep a record of all communications with you.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Emails and Newsletters:</span>From time to time, members of the Webnames Group may send to you email or other communications containing information about the Webnames Group, the Services, the Websites, and other matters they believe may interest you.  You may also sign up to receive newsletters from the Webnames Group.
