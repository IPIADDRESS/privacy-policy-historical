        <h3>Overview of Services</h3>
        <p>AdMaster is an advertising exchange where third party advertisers ("Advertisers") may distribute online text, banner, full page or inline advertisements ("Ads") to advertising zones ("Ad Zones") located on Internet websites that are owned or operated by other third parties ("Publishers").  Advertisers and Publishers can manage their accounts on our exchange through a self-service account management interface ("Interface") located at AdMaster.com ("Our Website").  A Publisher website to which we deliver Ads is sometimes referred to in this Policy as a Publisher Site and all Publisher Sites are sometimes referred to collectively in this Policy as the Publisher Network.  To avoid any confusion, you should understand that while we own and operate Our Website, we do not own or operate any Publisher Site. AdMaster seeks to optimize the delivery of Ads to Ad Zones within the Publisher Network using auction pricing, real-time bidding, API functionality, behavioral targeting and unparalleled access to campaign information. This privacy policy is intended to inform you about our collection, use, storage and disclosure of information that we collect or record in the course of providing these services.</p>

        <h3>Overview of Our Users</h3>
        <p>Three types of users interact with us. For ease of reference, we use the following definitions in this Policy:  Surfers are users who navigate to AdMaster.com.  Members are Advertisers or Publishers who have completed our registration process and accepted our terms of use, or Advertisers who have signed written agreements with us for the management of their accounts.  Members also include Managed Advertisers who have signed written agreements with us for the management of our services.  Viewers are users who view or click on an Ad Zone that is powered by AdMaster. Depending on your particular interaction with us, different portions of this policy may apply to you at different times.</p>

<h3>What Kind of Information Do We Collect From You and Why?</h3>
        <p><strong>Personal Information</strong>, is information that can be associated with a particular person or entity.  Personal Information does not include IP addresses or information that has been anonymized so that it cannot identify a particular user using reasonable efforts.  Examples of Personal Information are:
        </p>
<ul>
        <li>name </li>
          <li>telephone number
          </li>
        <li>email address
        </li>
        <li>credit card number (Advertisers only)
        </li>
        <li>Tax ID or Social Security Number (Publishers only)
        </li>
        </ul>
<p>We collect Personal Information from Members so that we can transact business with Members and report Publisher payments to the IRS.  We also collect Personal Information from electronic mail sent to us ("Email Communications"), so that we can substantiate and follow up upon the information contained in the Email Communications.  Email Communications can be sent by either Members or Surfers, and include the following types of communications:
        </p>
<ul>
  <li>Copyright infringement notifications under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) or other applicable law ("Take-Down Notices")
  </li>
  <li>Notices of violations of our Subscriber Agreement or our acceptable use policies ("Violation Notices")
  </li>
  <li>Requests for assistance from our support department
    We do not collect Personal Information from Viewers.  </li>
</ul>
<p>We do not merge Personal Information that we derive from Email Communications with other Personal Information.  We do not merge Personal Information that we collect from Members with Non-Personal Information that we collect from Viewers or Surfers.  We do merge Personal Information that we collect from Members with Non-Personal Information that we collect from Members. </p>
<p><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>&nbsp;is  any information other than Personal Information. We collect three types of  Non-Personal Information from users:<br>
  <strong>Session Data</strong>&nbsp;is information we collect from Surfers and Members  to assist them with navigation on our Website and to allow us to make  improvements to Our Website.&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Account Data</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>is information we collect from Members that is not  Personal Information or Session Data.&nbsp; This information is necessary for  us to transact business with Members, as well as to prevent and detect fraud.  While Account Data is not Personal Information, it is associated with a  particular Member account and may therefore be merged with the Personal  Information or Session Data of that Member. &nbsp;Examples of Account Data that  we collect from Members are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bid, budget, reserve price and targeting  information we receive from Advertisers through the Interface</li>
  <li>Ad Zone and Ad approval information we receive from  Publishers through the Interface</li>
  <li>The date, time and IP address of a Member’s initial  registration and any subsequent login to the Interface</li>
  <li>Certain activities of a Member using the Interface,  such as the creation or deletion of a Publisher’s Ad Zone or the adjustment to  an Advertiser’s budget or bid</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Viewer Data</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>is information we collect about Viewers. We use  Viewer Data to optimize the delivery of Ads to Ad Zones so that, for example,  we are less likely to deliver an Ad targeted toward men to a Viewer we believe  is a woman, and we are less likely to deliver the same Ad repeatedly to the  same Viewer. We also use some Viewer Data for fraud prevention and detection  and to document transactions for invoicing and commission purposes. Examples of  Viewer Data that we collect from Viewers are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The type and version of browser and operating  system used by the Viewer (“<strong>System Info</strong>”)</li>
  <li>The approximate geographic location of the Viewer  based on their IP address (“<strong>Geographic Info</strong>”)</li>
  <li>The most recent Publisher Sites to which the Viewer  has navigated</li>
  <li>Any past Ads that the Viewer has viewed or on which  the Viewer has clicked</li>
  <li>Any past conversions from Ads by the Viewer of  which we are aware</li>
  <li>Any other inferences we make regarding a Viewer  (e.g., is likely to be a man) or their preferences (e.g., appears to like  gardening)</li>
</ul>

        <h3>What Types of Information Do We Collect From Children?</h3>      
          <p>We do not intentionally collect Personal  information or Non-Personal Information from children under 13 years of age.  However, if a child under 13 years of age navigates to Our Website or to one of  our Ad Zones or Pixels on a Publisher Site, we may store Session Data and/or  Viewer Data on their browser as we would with any other Surfer or Viewer. If  you have reason to believe that a child under 13 years of age has provided us  with Personal Information, please contact us at privacy@AdMaster.com.</p>

<div class="topic" style="margin-top:40px;">
  <div class="topic" style="margin-top:40px;">
   <h3>How Do We Collect Information From You?</h3>
    <p><strong>Personal Information</strong><strong>.</strong> We collect  Personal Information from Members through the online registration process,  though sometimes this information is given to us offline and entered by us  online on the Member’s behalf.&nbsp; We require Members to keep this  information updated as they continue to use our services. We also collect  Personal Information from Members and Surfers from Email Communications that they  send to us.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<br>
    <strong>Session Data</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; We collect Session Data from Surfers when they  navigate to AdMaster.com by setting Cookies on their browser. &nbsp;We collect  Session Data from Members when they log into our Interface by setting Cookies  on their browser and by recording Session Data in our action logs.</p>
    <p><br>
    <strong>Account Data</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; We collect Account Data from Members through the  Interface as they register, log in or out, or make decisions on the Interface  with respect to their Ads or Ad Zones. Some of this Account Data is collected  when a Member enters information into the Interface in response to a query,  while other Account Data is recorded by us in our action logs.</p>
    <p><br>
      <strong>Viewer Data</strong>.&nbsp; We  collect System Info from Viewers using information transmitted by their browser  and Geographic Info from Viewers from information associated with the Viewer’s  IP address. We collect other Viewer Data from Cookies and Pixels. If you are a  Viewer, whenever you view an Ad Zone that is part of the Publisher Network, we  will set or update one or more Cookies on your browser. Each time you view an  Ad Zone, click on an Ad or take any action with a vendor that resulted from an  Ad (such as completing a lead form or purchasing a product or service) we may  update those Cookies and we may update a Log File associated with that Ad Zone  display to record your interests or preferences. We also contract with third  party data providers to purchase Viewer Data from them. This data is referred  to below as&nbsp;<strong>Third  Party Viewer Data</strong>.&nbsp; In order to match Third Party Viewer Data  with you, we may allow third parties to drop our Pixel on Web pages to which  you navigate so that we can update the Cookie we put on your browser.</p>

  </div>
  
<a name="What are Cookies, Pixels and Log Files? Can you refuse them?"></a>
      <div class="topic" style="margin-top:40px;">
        <h3>What are Cookies,Pixels and Log Files? Can you refuse them?</h3>
        <p><strong>A Cookie</strong>&nbsp;is  a small packet of data that is stored on your Internet browser.&nbsp; We use  Cookies to store Session Data and Viewer Data. We assign a randomly-generated  identifier (not your actual identity) to your browser (“<strong>Visitor ID</strong>”) and store it  in a Cookie so that a website can recognize your browser the next time you  visit the website.&nbsp; Cookies allow us to store Viewer preferences,  customize the display of content on a Viewer’s browser and record activities  relating to Ad Zones so that Viewers will receive more relevant and less  repetitive Ads when they next encounter an Ad Zone. &nbsp;Most browsers are set  up initially to accept Cookies.&nbsp; There are four ways you may refuse  Cookies:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You       may set your browser to disable or delete all third-party Cookies.&nbsp;       The mechanics to do this vary by browser and you should check your       browser’s help file to learn how to take either action.&nbsp; If you       disable or delete Cookies at the browser level, the features and       functionality of many websites may be affected and you may see the same       content and Ads repeatedly on some websites. For example, if you were a       Member and you elected to disable Cookies, you would not be able to use       any of the authenticated services we provide on Our Website.</li>
          <li>You       may set your browser to prompt you each time a website wants to set a       Cookie and ask for your permission.&nbsp; By refusing permission to any       given Cookie, you will prevent only a single Cookie from being       created.&nbsp; Note, however, that because of the number of Cookies set by       some websites, choosing to review Cookies on an individual basis may prove       to be burdensome and may interfere with the features and functionality of       some websites, including Our Website.</li>
          <li>You       may elect to use our <a href="#_COOKIE_OPT_OUT">Opt-Out</a> tool.&nbsp; If       you elect to use this tool, we will delete most Viewer Data (such as your       estimated age, gender, interests and preferences) from your browser and we       will set a new ‘<strong>Opt-Out Cookie</strong>” on your browser that will       instruct our system not to store any of this data in the future and not to       use any remaining Viewer Data we have (such as information regarding Ads       you have previously seen) to target Ads to you in the future. To set an <a href="#_COOKIE_OPT_OUT">Opt-Out</a> of Cookie on your browser. Please       note:
            <ul>
              <li>Because        the Opt-Out Cookie is a Cookie-based solution, it will not function if        you disable all Cookies at the browser level. Likewise, if you set an        Opt-Out Cookie and then later delete all Cookies from your browser, you        will also delete the Opt-Out Cookie and we will begin to collect Viewer        Data from you again until you set a new Opt-Out Cookie.</li>
              <li>Setting        an Opt-Out Cookie will not block us from setting Cookies on your browser        that collect Session Data and Viewer Data that is not used to target Ads        to you.</li>
              <li>An        Opt-Out Cookie is specific to one browser. If you set an Opt-Out Cookie        on one browser and then use another browser from the same computer, the        Opt-Out Cookie will not stop the second browser from accepting Cookies        from us that collect Viewer Data.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>AdMaster       is also a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (“<strong>NAI”</strong>), which allows for the       central deletion of its members' cookies from a single opt-out page. If       you opt-out of AdMaster Cookies on the NAI website, it will result in an       Opt-Out Cookie being set on your browser, subject to all of the       limitations explained above. To find out more and/or opt-out of NAI member       cookies. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>A&nbsp;<strong>Pixel</strong>&nbsp;(also  known as a web beacon) is an image on a website page that may not be visible to  the naked eye. We use Pixels to convey Viewer Data to your browser or to our  Log Files.&nbsp; Viewing a screen with a Pixel may instruct your browser to  update a Cookie associated with that Pixel. For example, if we wanted to record  whether a product was purchased using your browser, we would place a Pixel on  the Advertiser’s site so that when the purchase was completed, the Cookie on  your browser would be updated to reflect the purchase. At the same time, we  would record the purchase in a Log File.&nbsp; Most browsers are set up  initially to accept Pixels.&nbsp; There are two ways to prevent Pixels from  recording information about your web activities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You       may set your browser controls to reject all third party image tags. The       mechanics to do this vary by browser and you should check your browser’s       help file to learn how to take this action.&nbsp; Please note, however,       that rejecting all third party image tags may interfere with the features       and functionality of many websites, including Our Website.</li>
          <li>Because       Pixels are used to update Cookies on your browser, you may also instruct       your browser to disable or delete Cookies or to ask permission before a       Cookie is accepted, or you may set an Opt-Out Cookie on your browser.       These actions would render ineffective Pixels that record Viewer Data in       your Cookies and would delete the Visitor ID from your browser, rendering       anonymous Log File information recorded from other Pixels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A&nbsp;<strong>Log  File</strong>&nbsp;is a temporary file we create and store on our  system to store everything we know about the display of an Ad Zone. A Viewer’s  Visitor ID is noted in the Log File. You cannot elect to disable Log Files,  though if you delete Cookies or set an Opt-Out Cookie, you will delete the  Visitor ID from your browser and there would be no way to tie a particular Log  File back to your browser.<br>
        Please note that disabling Cookies or Pixels on  your browser or setting an Opt-Out Cookie does not mean you will no longer  receive online Ads from us. It means that we will no longer be able to deliver  Ads to you that are tailored to your preferences or to limit the number of  times you see the same Ad.</p>

      <div class="topic" style="margin-top:40px;">
        <h3>Where and For How Long Do We Store Information That We Collect?</h3>
        <p><strong>Personal Information and Account Data</strong>.&nbsp;  We store all Personal Information and Account Data in our data centers, except  for Personal information derived from Email Communications.&nbsp; We keep all  Personal Information and Account Data we collect from Members indefinitely,  though we reserve the right to delete such information at any time at our  convenience. Personal Information derived from Email Communications is stored  by a third party service provider on their network for up to three years after  it is sent to us, except for Take-Down Notices and Violation Notices which we  may retain indefinitely.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<br>
        <strong>Session Data</strong>.&nbsp;  We store Session Data in Cookies on a Surfer’s or Member’s browser and/or in  our data centers. &nbsp;Session Data stored in Cookies is retained until it is  overwritten at a later time with new Session Data or until a Surfer or Member  deletes the Cookies from his or her browser. Session Data stored in our data  centers is retained indefinitely, though we reserve the right to delete such  information at any time at our convenience.&nbsp; The third party we use to  assist us with website design may keep Session Data it collects indefinitely,  but our only access to this data is on an aggregate basis (e.g., 200 users clicked  on a specific link on Our Website in January).&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br>
        <strong>Viewer Data</strong>.&nbsp; We store  Viewer Data about Viewers on Cookies in a Viewer’s browser.&nbsp; Currently, we  retain this Viewer Data until we record more recent or relevant information  over that data or until the Viewer next encounters one of our Ad Zones six  months after the data was recorded on the Cookies, whichever occurs  first.&nbsp; We also store Viewer Data in our Log Files which are maintained in  our data centers. &nbsp;Log Files are currently retained for two weeks, except  for one day of Log Files each year that is retained for auditing purposes for  seven years.&nbsp;</p>

<a name="What security measures do we use to protect information that we store?"></a>
      <div class="topic" style="margin-top:40px;">
        <h3>What Security Measures Do We Use To Protect Information That We Store?</h3>
        <p>We maintain commercially reasonable security  protections to protect information we collect from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Information       we collect is not publicly accessible from Our Website.</li>
          <li>We       use a multi-level, password protected security system to control access to       information stored about users. In particular, we use Secure Socket Layer       (SSL) encryption to protect Personal Information we collect from Members       through the Interface, though a Member can opt out of using SSL if they       choose.</li>
          <li>We       maintain strict physical security of our properties and facilities and       only provide access to authorized personnel.</li>
          <li>We       are certified as compliant with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) data       security standard pertaining to the security of credit card information.</li>
          <li>We       restrict access to personal information to employees, contractors and       agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or       improve our services. AdMaster employees are bound by confidentiality       obligations to the company and may be subject to discipline, including       termination, if they fail to meet these obligations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While we try our best to safeguard and protect all  information we collect, please be advised that no data transmission over the  Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Furthermore, Session Data  and Viewer Data (other than in Log Files) are stored on a user’s browser, not  in our network, and security measures for such information are the  responsibility of the user operating the browser.</p>

        <h3>Can I Opt Out Of Receiving Targeted Emails?</h3>
        <p>If you are a Member, we may occasionally send you Targeted Emails that promote our services or that inform you about changes to our services.  Out of respect for your privacy, we include an option in each promotional email to opt out of receiving these types of communications in the future by following the instructions included in the email. We may also send you service-related Targeted Emails on occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance or if an advertisement you submitted was rejected, we might send you an email.  Generally, you may not opt-out of service-related emails.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.  We do not send Targeted Emails to Surfers or Viewers.</p>

        <p>AdMaster has non-disclosure agreements in place  with third parties to whom we may disclose your Personal information and  Non-Personal information under this Policy.

Although we choose our Advertisers and Publishers carefully and  encourage them to follow reasonable privacy practices, we are not responsible  for the privacy practices of third party websites and they are under no  obligation to comply with this Policy. &nbsp;Before visiting another website  and before providing any information to the party that operates or advertises  on that website, you should review the privacy policy and practices of the  website to determine how information that they collect from you will be  handled.</p>
