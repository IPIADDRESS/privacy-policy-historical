            Last Updated: March 1, 2008 </div>
            <p align="left" class="style9">WebVideoUniversity.com strives to offer its   visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an   interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable   Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number)   subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent   your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style11">How we gather information from users</p>
            <p align="left" class="style9">How we collect and store information depends on the   page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the   services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you   register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features,   such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information   when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms,   and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites,   WebVideoUniversity.com also collects information automatically and through   the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For   example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie   technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other   things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from   having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the   number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our   site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through   other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with   information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies,   but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be   asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to   customize the siteâ€™s features according to your preferences.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style11">What we do with the information we collect</p>
            <p align="left" class="style9">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to   enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We   respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style9">Aggregated Information (information that does not   personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine   information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from   other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages   are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information   may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again,   this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about   you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style9">We may use Personally Identifiable Information   collected on WebVideoUniversity.com to communicate with you about your   registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy   policy; services and products offered by WebVideoUniversity.com and other   topics we think you might find of interest. </p>
            <p align="left" class="style9">Personally Identifiable Information collected by   WebVideoUniversity.com may also be used for other purposes, including but   not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce   transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other   communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for   the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such   information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition,   from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy,   merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user   information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your   information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are   reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of   amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we   deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice   prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style9"><strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style9">WebVideoUniversity.com expects its partners,   advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware,   however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and   other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy   and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to   our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a   WebVideoUniversity.com page, certain content that is actually created or   hosted by a third party. Also, through WebVideoUniversity.com you may be   introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests   or sweepstakes offered by other parties. WebVideoUniversity.com is not   responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check   the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing   information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style9">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional   partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt   to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For   example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include   cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a   particular advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer   services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to   gather information. WebVideoUniversity.com does not control the use of   this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not   responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style9">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily   disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas,   that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third   parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other   individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of   WebVideoUniversity.com and this policy.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style11">Children</p>
            <p align="left" class="style9">WebVideoUniversity.com does not knowingly   collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children   under 18 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any   information from a child under 18 in violation of this policy, we will delete   that information immediately. If you believe WebVideoUniversity.com has   any information from or about anyone under 18, please contact us at the address   listed below.</p>

Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms   will mean you accept those changes. Information collected prior to the time any   change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at   the time the information was collected.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style11">Governing law</p>
            <p align="left" class="style9">This policy and the use of this Site are governed by   Indiana law.

Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated   with the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.</p>
