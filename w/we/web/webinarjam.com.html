            <p><strong>How we collect and use your non-personal information</strong></p>

            <p>The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: disc">
              <li><p>We may collect non-personal information (e.g. demographic information) regarding our customers collectively including information such as age, gender, occupation, preferred language, zip code, area code, geographic location, or the time zone from which customers access the Sites, products, or services.

            </ul>
          </li>


          <li>
            <h4>Cookies and Other Technologies</h4>
            <p>To help Genesis Digital serve you better, we use technological means to better understand and adapt to user behavior.  To accomplish this, the Sites, as well as our online software and services, email messages, and advertisements may use cookies or related technology such as pixel tags, clear gifs, and web beacons. These technologies help us to know which parts of the Sites people have visited, and provide data to aid us in understanding the effectiveness of the software services, our advertisements, and web searches.  These data are used to improve our software, products, services, communications, and advertisements. We generally consider such information collected through the use of cookies and other technologies as non-personal information, and treat it accordingly.</p>
            <p>We also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use the Sites, software, products, or services. These uses are intended to improve your personal experience.   For example, we can provide better and more personal results if we â€˜remember' your preferred settings, your name, and such.</p>
            <p>Genesis Digital may use cookies or other technologies in connection with certain advertising services to determine your experience with our content including whether an ad is likely to be of interest to you, whether or not you are served a particular ad, and the number of times you are served a particular ad. These technologies allow us to measure the effectiveness of our ad campaigns.  You may have options for opting out of such targeted ads.  You should contact your service provider or your mobile provider to inquire about how to do so.</p>
            <p>Genesis Digital also uses specific technologies in connection with certain communications such as emails that may be used to track actions by recipients.  For example, these communications may include one or more clickable text or graphics that include URLs that link to content on the Sites. However, these URLs, may pass through a web server that tracks the click before arriving at the linked content on the Sites. The tracked data can help Genesis Digital determine the effectiveness of our communications to users and customers, or to gage interest in specific topics. If you prefer not to have your responses to such communications tracked in this manner, do not click links in the email messages.  Such communications may also include pixel tags that can tell us whether e.g. an email has been opened. We may use this information to throttle the number of messages sent to users or customers, or to remove people who do not read or interact with our communications from one or more lists.</p>
            <p>Cookies and other technologies can generally be controlled on your devices.  If you want to disable cookies and you should review your privacy or security settings.  Please note that certain features of the Sites or related software, products, or services may not be available if you have cookies disabled on your device.  We will typically try to warn you that a page or feature you are trying to reach will not function without cookies enabled.  If you have your cookies on your device or browser disabled and are having difficulties you may wish to enable them to see if the problem is resolved.</p>
