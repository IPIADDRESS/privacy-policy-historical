  <u>Affiliated YNOT Services on other sites</u>.&nbsp; From time to time, webcamhackers.COM may offer some  of its Services on or through other websites.&nbsp;  In the event that webcamhackers.COM offers such services, it is possible that  personal information users provide to those sites may be sent to webcamhackers.COM to  facilitate delivery of those services.&nbsp; webcamhackers.COM  will process such information under this Policy as if the information had been  submitted directly to webcamhackers.COM from its users.&nbsp; Any affiliated site through which webcamhackers.COM’s  services are offered will likely have its own privacy policy, which may be very  different from webcamhackers.COM’s.&nbsp; It is very  important for users to review the privacy policies for such affiliated sites  before submitting personal information to them.<br>
  <u>Other sites</u>.&nbsp; This Policy  only applies to services offered by webcamhackers.COM.&nbsp; webcamhackers.COM is not able to exercise control  over sites that are linked to from within our various Services.&nbsp; These other sites may collect data, set their  own cookies in users’ browsers, or ask users to provide personal information.<br>

<p>If webcamhackers.COM  must use any personal information in a manner different from those described,  it will seek your consent prior to that use.&nbsp;  webcamhackers.COM possesses personal information in the United States and in  other countries, and in some cases may store personal information outside of  your country.</p>
<p><strong>Information Sharing</strong></p>
<p>webcamhackers.COM  will share personal information with companies or individuals outside of webcamhackers.COM  under limited circumstances:</p>
<p>-webcamhackers.COM  has obtained your consent to release personal information.</p>
<p>-The  information is being shared with a subsidiary or webcamhackers.COM affiliate.</p>
<p>-Access,  use or distribution of your personal information is, in webcamhackers.COM’s good  faith belief, reasonably required to a) satisfy an applicable law, regulation,  legal process or enforceable government request (e.g. a warrant, subpoena or  other court order), b) enforce the Terms and Conditions, and investigate their  breach, c) detect and prevent security issues, d) protect against harm to webcamhackers.COM  or its users, and e) to pursue good faith allegations of piracy brought by webcamhackers.COM  or third parties.</p>
