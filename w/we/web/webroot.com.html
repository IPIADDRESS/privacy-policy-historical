<h1>Webroot's Privacy Policy</h1>



<p>Webroot Software, Inc.'s privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") covers the collection and use of personal information ("Personal Information") that we may gather any time you interact with us, such as when you visit our Web site, purchase Webroot products, or when you call our customer support or sales departments. This policy describes our data privacy practices, including what type of information is gathered, how Webroot uses the information, and how we safeguard your Personal Information. 

</p>

<p>At Webroot, protecting your privacy is important to us. After all, online privacy and security is what we're all about.</p>



<p><b>You expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy.  Personal Information may be processed by Webroot in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent.</b></p>





<h2>Why Webroot Collects Personal Information </h2>







<p>Webroot only collects your Personal Information where it is required to provide you the best services and products available. By maintaining an accurate customer database, we are able to send notifications via e-mail to keep you informed about the status of your orders or accounts and to provide updates and technical notices. These messages are essential to the maintenance of your subscription and the functionality of our products and services. </p>



<h2>What Information We Collect </h2>



<p>Webroot collects your Personal Information at a variety of points, including when you place an order, register software, request services or take part in other activities on our Web site.  For example, we often ask for your Personal Information when you are conferring with one of our customer support technicians, downloading a new product or program update, registering your software or purchasing a product. 

During these interactions we will collect Personal Information relevant to your transacting with Webroot, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information along with information about the Webroot products you own, such as the activation code or keycode, date of purchase and information relating to a support issue.</p>

<p>

Please be aware that if you prefer not to provide us with your Personal Information, because such information may be necessary for us to provide certain services, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, make such services available to you.</p>

	<h3>Regarding Children</h3>



<p>Webroot does not intentionally gather Personal Information about visitors who are under the age of 13.</p>



<h3>Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>

<p>Following common e-commerce practices, Webroot uses "cookies" and other technologies to collect non-personal data that enables us to better understand and improve the usability, performance and effectiveness of Webroot's Web site. Cookies are unique text files sent to your browser and stored on your computer.</p>



<p>If you do not want Webroot to send cookies to your browser, you can set your browser options to reject cookies or notify you when a Web site tries to put a cookie in your browser software. Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use some of our Web site services.

</p>

<p>Additionally, Webroot gathers general information about visits to our Web site and stores this information in log files. This information is stored in anonymous profiles and is not associated with a user's account.  This information includes the number of total visits to our Web site, and which browser is used to view our Web site (including the version number). No Personal Information is contained in this data. Webroot uses this information to understand traffic and downloads on our Web site, enabling us to improve the site, provide the best online experience possible and improve our ability to serve our customers.

</p>



<h2>Sharing Your Personal Information </h2>



<p>Webroot is committed to protecting your privacy. Webroot will not, under any circumstances, rent or sell your Personal Information nor does Webroot trade or exchange mailing lists with any other organization. Furthermore, Webroot only shares your Personal Information with our contractors that assist us in our efforts to fulfill our obligations to you, and then only with partners that commit to adhere to the same level of commitment as Webroot to protect your privacy and data. Webroot maintains this information; but we may disclose your Personal Information to third parties if we believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Webroot; (3) enforce the Webroot Terms of Service Agreement; or (4) protect the safety of any individual or the general public.</p>

<h3>Webroot Affiliates</h3>



<p>Webroot may share some or all of your Personal Information with a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "affiliates"), in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

</p>  



<h2>How We Communicate with You </h2>



<p>Webroot has an optional e-mail service for customers who wish to periodically receive promotional information, such as general product, service and Webroot news. Customers are provided the option to opt-out within each e-mail. If you no longer wish to receive Webroot communications, you may "unsubscribe" from our mailing program at any time in the following ways:</p>

<ul>

<li>By clicking on the auto-unsubscribe link included in each e-mail 

</li><li>By contacting our technical support department at 1-800-772-9383

</li></ul>

<p>We will then update our database and take reasonable measures so that no further promotional correspondence should be sent to the e-mail address.  You may, however, still receive transactional messages.</p>



<h3>Transactional Messages</h3>



<p>Webroot sends required notifications via e-mail to keep you informed of the status of your orders or accounts and to provide updates and technical notices. This service is used for messages that are important for the maintenance of your subscription and the functionality of our services. When you purchase or register a product online, we require an e-mail address for completion of the transaction, which we will use for these communications.</p>



<h2>Ways to Update Your Personal Information </h2>



<p>Webroot carefully maintains our customer database in an effort to keep your Personal Information accurate for the purposes for which it is used. It is your right to be able to update your Personal Information as needed. You can correct out-of-date information, update information, remove information or review any information previously provided to Webroot by calling our individual sales department office during normal business hours (7 a.m. MST to 6 p.m. MST) at 1-800-772-9383. Please note, however, that we may retain certain information relating to software licensing and your information may also be retained in our archives.  When contacting customer service, we will verify your identification through the use of security questions before sharing any Personal Information as it appears in our customer database.</p>



<h2>Webroot's Commitment to Data Security</h2>



<p>Webroot has security measures in place, such as the following, to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your Personal Information in our customer database. Personal Information provided to Webroot is stored in secure facilities with access restricted to authorized personnel only. We have put in place a series of access-control procedures required for retrieval of personal information.  The Webroot Web site is regularly tested for security breaches to protect against unauthorized viewing of Personal Information.</p>



<p>To provide secure credit card processing when ordering, orders placed on our Web site are processed through a payment gateway which operates under its own privacy policy.</p>



<p>Webroot DOES NOT store credit card information. If you choose to purchase the software online using a credit card, the credit card information is sent to Webroot using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption, an industry-standard method for protecting data as it travels over the Internet. If at any time you would like to make a purchase, but do not want to provide your credit card information online, you may contact an individual sales representative over the telephone. Simply call 1-800-772-9383.</p>



<p>Although we make good faith efforts to store the Personal Information we collect in a secure operating environment that is not accessible to unauthorized users, we cannot guarantee complete security.</p>



<h2>Acceptance of this Privacy Policy</h2>



<p>By using the Web site or any services provided through the Web site, you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>



<h2>Privacy Policy Revisions</h2>



<p>Webroot reserves the right to amend, revise or modify this policy and our other policies and agreements at any time and in any manner. Any revisions, amendment or modification will be posted on <a href="/company/privacy.html?WRSID=f58ee3d440ffca38baa98670ab559a6d">www.webroot.com/company/privacy</a>.</p>
