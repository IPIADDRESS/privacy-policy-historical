Statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, goals, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not statements of historical fact, and may be “forward looking statements.” Such statements are based on projections, estimates and expectations at the time the statements are made, and may involve risks which could cause actual results to differ than those anticipated.<br><br>

In order to reduce the risk of too many traders possibly influencing the market by attempting identical trades, Wealth Insider Alliance limits the number of subscribers in any one service. Once the limit is reached, WIA may create a clone site using the same guidelines, strategies and policies. Subscribers to clone sites will receive information unique to each service, respectfully.</p>

		    This site is owned and operated by Wealth Insider Alliance LLC. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance  to us. At WealthInsiderAlliance we want to make your  experience online satisfying and safe.<br>

            <br>

            Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we  feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and  conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This  privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use  it.<br>

            <br>

            INFORMATION Wealth Insider Alliance GATHERS AND TRACKS<br>

            <br>

            Wealth Insider Alliance gathers two types of information about users:<br>

            <br>

            •  Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions.  These are voluntary submissions to receive information via email, our  electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums,  to email a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys.<br>

            <br>

            • Information Wealth Insider Alliance gathers through  aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views  throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our  content to visitors' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors  better understand the demographics of our audience. Under no  circumstances does Wealth Insider Alliance divulge any  information about an individual user to a third party.<br>

            <br>

            Wealth Insider Alliance Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:<br>

            <br>

            Optional Voluntary Information<br>

            We offer the following services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:<br>

            <br>

            1. Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches)<br>

            We will offer a  free electronic newsletter to users. Wealth Insider Alliance  gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users  may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link  provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription  management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the  time of registration.<br>

            <br>

            2. Message boards/forums policy<br>

            Users of the site's Message  Boards and Forums must register separately for these services (both are  free of charge) in order to post messages, although they needn't  register to visit the site. During registration the user is required to  supply a username, password, and email address.<br>

            <br>

            3. "E-mail this to a friend" policy<br>

            Our site users can choose to  electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by  clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide their email  address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used  only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the  recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any  other purpose.<br>

            <br>

            4. Polling<br>

            We may offer interactive polls to users so they can  easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience  thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are  aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. Wealth Insider Alliance may use a system to "tag" users after they have  voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is  not correlated with information about individual users.<br>

            <br>

            5. Surveys<br>

            Wealth Insider Alliance may occasionally  conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We  sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys  with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this  information about specific individuals with any third party.<br>

            <br>

            6. Subscriptions<br>

            On some of our sites, we offer paid  subscriptions to users who wish to voluntarily subscribe. All personal  information is protected with data encryption, firewalls and passwords.  We never share any of this information about specific individuals with  any third party.<br>

            <br>

            Children<br>

            Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy  Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request  personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13  without requesting parental consent.<br>

            <br>

            Usage tracking<br>

            Wealth Insider Alliance tracks user  traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not  correlate this information with data about individual users.  Wealth Insider Alliance does break down overall usage  statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME  type by reading this information from the browser string (information  contained in every user's browser).<br>

Wealth Insider Alliance sometimes tracks and catalogs the  search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking  is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information  to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based  on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read,  but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue  to build a better service for you.<br>

<br>

Cookies<br>

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the  browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain  Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of  this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly  provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is  information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard  disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Wealth Insider Alliance uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as  described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to  better track ad impressions and click rates.<br>

<br>

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If  you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will  receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have  cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to  participate actively in message boards, forums, polling and surveys.<br>

<br>

Privacy Policy Use<br>

How the information you gather is used if relevant.<br>

<br>

USE OF INFORMATION<br>

Wealth Insider Alliance uses any information voluntarily given by our  users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to  provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better  prepare future content based on the interests of our users.<br>

<br>

As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide  in order to send out electronic emails and newsletters and to enable  users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We  send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on  the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we  think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are  doing. Wealth Insider Alliance never shares newsletter  mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors  or partners.<br>

<br>

When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our  sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do  not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page  performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for  you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many  measures of what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a  particular user enters.<br>

<br>

Wealth Insider Alliance creates aggregate reports on  user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and  partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively,  and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to  their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual  users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user  clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any  individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal  process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.<br>

<br>

SHARING OF INFORMATION<br>

Wealth Insider Alliance uses  the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your  needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's  demographics. We will not share information about individual users with  any third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal  process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.<br>

<br>

SECURITY<br>

Wealth Insider Alliance operates secure data  networks protected by industry standard firewall and password  protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically  reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have  access to the information provided by our customers.<br>

<br>

OPT-OUT POLICY<br>

We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:<br>

• Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters.<br>

•  Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which  completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable  information from our users.<br>

<br>

YOUR CONSENT<br>

By using this site, you consent to the collection  and use of this information by Wealth Insider Alliance LLC. If we decide to  change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so  that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use  it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
