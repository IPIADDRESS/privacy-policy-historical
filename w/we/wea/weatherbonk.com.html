    <h1>Weather Bonk Privacy Policy</h1>
    <!--PRIVACY BODY TEXT-->
<div>
	<h2>EFFECTIVE AS OF October 21, 2008</h2>
	<p>
		WB Acquisition Corporation, d/b/a Weatherbonk ("WBAC") is strongly committed to protecting your 
		privacy. This Privacy Policy discloses how we collect, use and share information we gather about you 
		on WBAC's Web sites and the choices you have regarding our use of and your ability to correct the 
		information. This Privacy Policy applies only to WBAC's Web sites. We hope that this disclosure will 
		enhance your experience on the Internet and reinforce the trust that you place in WBAC's services. 
	</p>

	<h2>Information Collected Online</h2>
	<p>
		Most of the information provided by WBAC is offered without our collecting any personally identifiable 
		information from you. For instance, you can view weather conditions in your hometown or anywhere in 
		the world without giving out any personally identifiable information. In order to maximize your 
		experience and to provide you with enhanced products and services, however, WBAC collects personally 
		identifiable information (<span class="italics">e.g.</span>, name, e-mail address, etc.) and demographic data (<span class="italics">e.g.</span>, zip code, 
		year of birth, interests, etc.) that you voluntarily supply to us. Some examples of instances when 
		we collect personally identifiable information include when you: 
		</p><ul>
			<li>Wish to upload a webcam, photo or other content to our site;</li>
			<li>Register for a promotion, contest or sweepstakes;</li>
			<li>Send us an e-mail message or complete an inquiry form to receive additional information;</li>
			<li>Participate in an online forum or community, or post a blog; or </li>
			<li>Request us to deliver certain content from our site to your mobile or wireless device. </li>
		</ul>
	<p></p>
	<p>
		Thus, you have a choice as to whether to provide your personally identifiable information. Although 
		you are not required to disclose any personally identifiable information to us, portions of our Web 
		site and other specialized services may be unavailable to you without such information.  For instance, 
		you will not be able to upload a webcam to our site without providing certain personally identifiable 
		information on the webcam submission page of our site.  
	</p>
	<p>
		In the case of participation in a chat session or blog posting, you are not required to provide 
		any personally identifiable information.  However, we do request that you enter a user name at 
		your discretion. Also, the sessions are monitored and transcripts are posted on the Web site for 
		access by other users.  Any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily disclose online 
		(<span class="italics">e.g.</span>, in blog postings/discussion boards, in messages, chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available 
		and can be read, collected and used by others.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable 
		information that you choose to submit in these forums.  
	</p>

	<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
	<p>
		We use the information you provide in a limited number of ways. We may use the information to display 
		information and advertisements that match your interests, notify you if you've won a contest or 
		sweepstakes, and compile demographic statistics about our users. We may on occasion combine information 
		about you that we have with information we obtain from other parties to enhance our ability to market to 
		you those products or services that may be of interest to you.  In addition, we may use your email 
		address without your consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of 
		major WBAC Web site changes or for customer service purposes).
	</p>

	<h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
	<p>
		One of the most valuable assets of our business is you. WBAC does not rent, sell or share personally 
		identifiable information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except as described 
		below. 
	</p>
	<h3>WBAC and its Affiliates</h3>
	<div class="indent">
		We provide you with the opportunity to opt in to receive special offers from WBAC and it 
		affiliates. If you opt in, WBAC and its affiliates will use your personally identifiable 
		information to inform you of other products and services available from weatherbonk.com 
		and its affiliates, including The Weather Channel, Inc. and WSI Corporation. These products 
		may include, for example, schedules for special programs on The Weather Channel cable network 
		or offers to purchase a calendar from The Weather Channel.
	</div>
	<h3>Third-Party Processors</h3>
	<div class="indent">
		When you submit your personal information on the weatherbonk.com Web site, it may be shared 
		with a selected third party ("Third Party Processors"). These Third Party Processors may 
		organize, administer, process, and/or analyze data on our behalf to help us provide more 
		relevant offers to you and to eliminate the delivery of duplicate offers. In addition, these 
		Third Party Processors correct and/or update users' data based on information we provide them. 
		We may also use Third Party Processors to deliver materials to you via e-mail or postal service. 
		The data we provide to Third Party Processors is securely stored and maintained by them so that 
		it can be accessed when needed for future purposes. Further, all such Third Party Processors are 
		contractually bound by us to keep the information confidential. All information provided to 
		Third Party Processors is used by them only to carry out the service they are providing for WBAC. 
	</div>
	<h3>Links to Other Web Sites</h3>
	<div class="indent">
		Like many Web sites on the Internet, WBAC links to pages located on Web sites maintained by 
		various other entities not bound by our Privacy Policy. In some cases, you may link to 
		pages of other Web sites that are framed with elements of weatherbonk.com, such as in the 
		header or footer. The URL will identify the site you are visiting. We are not responsible 
		for the information collection practices of other Web sites. The Privacy Policies of other 
		organizations may differ from ours, for example, with respect to the level of security, use 
		of cookies, and collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information. 
	</div>
	<h3>Purchase or Sale of Businesses</h3>
	<div class="indent">
		WBAC continually looks for ways to improve our business. One such way of improving our 
		business might be to buy or sell a company. If we buy or sell a business, databases 
		containing personally identifiable information will likely be transferred as part of 
		the sale. If we buy a business, we will honor the requests of that business' former 
		customers regarding their personally identifiable information. If in connection with 
		a sale there will be material changes to the way personally identifiable information 
		is being used, affected consumers will be notified via e-mail and will be given the 
		opportunity to opt-out. 
	</div>
	<h3>Other Limitations on Privacy</h3>
	<div class="indent">
		We may provide personally identifiable information without your permission (i) 
		pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders; (ii) 
		where WBAC believes our property or an individual's safety or security is at risk; (iii) 
		if we find that your actions violate our <a href="http://www.weather.com/common/home/legal.html?from=bonk" target="_blank">Legal Restrictions and Terms of Use</a>; or (iv) 
		where otherwise required by law. 
	</div>

	<h2>E-mail a Friend</h2>
	<p>
		If you choose to use our service that allows you to e-mail a page of our site to a friend, 
		in most circumstances, we do not have access to and do not collect any personally identifiable 
		information regarding you or your friend. On certain pages of the site, we need to have access 
		to your and your friend's e-mail addresses temporarily to send the e-mail due to technical 
		requirements. This information is deleted as soon as the e-mail is sent and is not used for 
		any other purpose.
	</p>

	<h2>IP Addresses, Cookies, Web Beacons, Gifs, and Information Saved by Other Technologies</h2>
	<p>
		WBAC and Third Party Processors acting on our behalf uses various Internet technologies which 
		help us to manage our site operations and track usage behavior so that we can tailor information 
		and advertisements to make your visits more enjoyable and meaningful. These Internet technologies 
		include: 
		</p><ul>
			<li>
				IP Addresses: random numbers assigned to individual computers which WBAC uses to administer 
				our Web site and help diagnose problems with our servers. 
			</li>
			<li>

		Our Web site may contain links to third party Web sites geared to children. The linked sites are not 
		under the control of WBAC. We are not responsible for the contents of any linked site or any link 
		contained in a linked site, nor are we responsible for the privacy practices of the operators of 
		those sites with respect to children. We strongly encourage parents and guardians to review the 
		Privacy Policies of all linked sites.

	<h2>Our Commitment to Security</h2>
	<p>
		Keeping the information you provide to WBAC secure is important to us. We have put in place 
		appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures designed to protect and safeguard 
		your data. Of course, although WBAC uses standard industry practices to protect your personally 
		identifiable information, we cannot guarantee that your communications with our site will never 
		be unlawfully intercepted, or that your personally identifiable information will never be 
		unlawfully accessed by third parties. 
	</p>

	<h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>
		WBAC reserves the right to alter our Privacy Policy as business needs require. If 
		we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes here so that you will always 
		know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose 
		it to anyone. All changes to this policy will be posted on our Web site prior to the time they 
		take effect. In the event that we make material changes to the way we use personally identifiable 
		information, affected consumers will be notified via e-mail and will be given the opportunity to 
		opt-out.
