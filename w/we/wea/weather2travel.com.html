<h2>7. How does affiliate marketing work?</h2>

<p>Clicking on affiliate marketing adverts or links will track your actions by using a cookie saved to your device. Your actions are usually recorded as a referral from our Site by this cookie. In most cases we earn a commission from the advertiser or advertising partner, at no cost to you, when you make a purchase on their website.</p>

<p>We use marketing partners in this way to help generate an income from the website, which allows us to continue our work and provide you with the best overall experience and valued information for free.</p>

<h2>8. Online advertising</h2>

<p>Advertisements displayed on the Site are delivered by certain third party advertising companies, such as Google. No information which identifies you, for example your name, address, email address or telephone number, is used to provide this advertising. </p>

<p>In order to display advertising most likely to be relevant to you, these third party advertisers may place or recognise a unique cookie on your browser. This cookie does not collect personal information about you nor is it linked to any identifiable information about you.</p>

<p>If you would like more information about online advertisements and your choices about how this information may used by these companies, please <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices" target="new window" rel="nofollow">click here</a>. </p>

<p>You can opt out of, or customise, these advertisements using the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/ads/preferences/" target="new window" rel="nofollow">Google Ads Preferences Manager</a>.</p>

<h2>9. Feedback requests</h2>

<p>If you have a question or comment for us, we ask you to fill in <a href="/contactus.php">our feedback form</a>. It will ask you to provide your contact details such as your name and email address. Your personal details will only be used according to your request and will remain safely stored without being passed to any third party.</p>

<h2>10. Newsletter signups</h2>

<p>Under the GDPR we use "the Consent Lawful Basis" for anyone subscribing to our newsletter. We only collect certain data about you, as detailed in the "What data do we collect?" section above. We send newsletters from an EMS, email marketing service provider. An EMS is a third party service provider of software that allows us to send out newsletter campaigns to a list of subscribers.</p>

<p>When you subscribe to our newsletter you will receive an email to confirm your email address. Once confirmed you will be added to our EMS to receive newsletters. Your email address will be stored securely in our newsletter database and our EMS. You will be asked to renew your subscription every 2 years. If you do not renew your subscription within this period your email address will be automatically unsubscribed from the newsletter within the EMS.</p>

<p>Newsletter emails contain tracking beacons / tracked clickable links or similar server technologies in order to track subscriber activity within newsletter messages. Where used, such messages may record a range of data such as; times, dates, IP addresses, opens, clicks, forwards, geographic and demographic data. Such data, within its limitations will show the activity each subscriber made for that email campaign.</p>

<p>Any messages we send are in accordance with the GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR). We provide you with an easy method to withdraw your consent (unsubscribe) or manage your preferences at any time. See newsletter messages for instructions on how to unsubscribe.</p>

<p>Our EMS provider is MailChimp. We may hold the following information about subscribers within our EMS system:</p>

<ul class="two_column_list orange_bullet">
	<li>Email address</li>
	<li>IP address</li>
	<li>Subscription date &amp; time</li>
	<li>Confirmation date &amp; time</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not share this information with any third party.</p>

<h2>12. How do we use your data?</h2>

<p>All personal data is processed and stored securely, for no longer than is necessary in light of the reason(s) for which it was first collected. We will comply with our obligations and safeguard your rights under GDPR at all times. </p>

<p>Our use of your personal data will always have a lawful basis, either because it is necessary for our performance of a contract with you, because you have consented to our use of your personal data (e.g. by subscribing to emails or agreeing to our Policy). Specifically, we may use your data for the following purposes:</p>

<ul class="orange_bullet">
	<li>Providing and managing your access to the Site</li>

	<li>Replying to emails from you</li>
	<li>Supplying you with emails that you have opted into (you may unsubscribe or opt-out at any time)</li>
</ul>

<p>With your permission and/or where permitted by law, we may also use your data for marketing purposes which may include contacting you by email with information, news and offers on our services. We will not, however, send you any unsolicited marketing or spam and will take all reasonable steps to ensure that we fully protect your rights and comply with our obligations under GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003.</p>

<p>You have the right to withdraw your consent to our using your personal data at any time, and to request that we delete it.</p>

<p>We do not keep your personal data for any longer than is necessary in light of the reason(s) for which it was first collected. Data will therefore be retained for the following periods (or its retention will be determined on the following bases):</p>

<p>Every 2 years you will be required to renew your opt-in status to receive emails from us. If you choose not to opt-in, we will unsubscribe you from the newsletter and you will stop receiving emails from us.</p>

<h2>13. Do we share your data?</h2>

<p>Subject to section 14, we will not share any of your data with any third party for any purpose unless otherwise stated in this Policy.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, we may be legally required to share certain data held by us, which may include your personal data, for example, where we are involved in legal proceedings, where we are complying with legal obligations, a court order, or a governmental authority.</p>

<p>We may compile statistics about the use of the Site including data on traffic, usage patterns, user numbers, sales, and other information. All such data will be anonymised and will not include any personally identifying data, or any anonymised data that can be combined with other data and used to identify you. We may from time to time share such data with third parties such as prospective investors, affiliates, partners, and advertisers. Data will only be shared and used within the bounds of the law.</p>

<h2>14. What happens if our business changes hands?</h2>

<p>We may, from time to time, expand or reduce our business and this may involve the sale and/or the transfer of control of all or part of our business. Any personal data that you have provided will, where it is relevant to any part of our business that is being transferred, be transferred along with that part and the new owner or newly controlling party will, under the terms of this Privacy Policy, be permitted to use that data only for the same purposes for which it was originally collected by us.</p>

<p>In the event that any of your data is to be transferred in such a manner, you will not be contacted in advance and informed of the transfer.</p>

<h2>15. How can you control your data?</h2>

<p>We aim to give you strong control over our use of your data for direct marketing purposes (including the ability to opt-out of receiving emails from us which you may do by unsubscribing using the links provided in our emails).</p>

<h2>16. How can you access your data?</h2>

<p>You have the right to ask for a copy of any of your personal data held by us (where such data is held). Under the GDPR, no fee is payable and we will provide any and all information in response to your request free of charge. </p>

<h2>17. Contacting us</h2>

<p>If you have any questions about the Site or our Policy, please contact Data Protection Officer via our <a href="/contactus.php">contact us form</a> or by post at:</p>

<h2>18. Changes to our privacy policy</h2>
