						<p><font class="sectionTitle">Information Collected Online</font></p>
						Most of the information provided by The Weather Channel is offered without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you.  For instance, you can view weather conditions in your hometown or anywhere in the world without giving out any personally identifiable information.  In order to maximize your experience and to provide you with enhanced products and services, however, The Weather Channel collects personally identifiable information (e.g., name, e-mail address, etc.) and demographic data (e.g., zip code, gender, birth date, interests, etc.) that you voluntarily supply to us. When you make a purchase or sign up for one of our premium services, we will also collect your billing address, phone number, and credit card information.  Some examples of instances when we collect personally identifiable information include when you:
<ul>
<li>Subscribe to our premium or enhanced services.  Examples include <i>Inbox Weather</i> (weather information delivered to you via e-mail ), <i>Desktop Weather</i> (a software application which you can download to your desktop to receive weather information), <i>Wireless Weather</i> (a family of services which allow you to receive weather information on your cellular phone or PDA)</li>
<li>Complete a survey</li>
<li>Register for a promotion, contest or sweepstakes</li>
<li>Send us an e-mail message</li>
<li>Submit a photo to the photo gallery</li>
<li>Participate in an online forum or community, or</li>
<li>Personalize weather.com.
</li></ul>
Thus, you have a choice as to whether to provide your personally identifiable information.  Although you are not required to disclose any personally identifiable information to us, portions of our Web site and other specialized services may be unavailable to you without such information. 
<p>In the case of participation in a chat session you are not required to provide any personally identifiable information.  However, we do require you to select a user name.  Also, the sessions are monitored and transcripts are posted on the Web site for access by other users.</p>

						<p><font class="sectionTitle">How We Use Your Information</font></p>
						We use the information you provide in a limited number of ways.  We may use the information to service your account, conduct a transaction that you have requested, display information and advertisements that match your interests and profile, notify you if you've won a contest or sweepstakes and compile demographic statistics about our users.  We may on occasion combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from other parties to enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be of interest to you.  
						<p><font class="sectionTitle">How We Share Your Information</font></p>
						One of the most valuable assets of our business is you.  The Weather Channel  does not rent, sell or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except as described below.

In these instances, we do not share your personally identifiable information with the third party sponsors-we do the mailing for them.  Additionally, you will always have the opportunity, with each e-mail, to opt-out of receiving future offers.   2)  In other instances, we provide you with the opportunity to receive products and services from specifically identified third parties directly through our site.  In these instances, you must explicitly consent to receive each offer.  When you explicitly agree to receive offers from specific third parties, your personally identifiable information is shared with the specific third party to enable them to provide you with the offer you have requested.

These Third Party Processors may include, for example, companies that process credit card information for The Weather Channel. These Third Party Processors may organize, administer, process, and/or analyze data on our behalf to help us provide more relevant offers to you and to eliminate the delivery of duplicate offers.  In addition, these Third Party Processors correct and/or update users' data based on information we provide them.  We may also use Third Party Processors to deliver materials to you via e-mail or postal service.  The data we provide to Third Party Processors is securely stored and maintained by them so that it can be accessed when needed for future purposes.  Further, all such Third Party Processors are contractually bound by us to keep the information confidential.  All information provided to Third Party Processors is used by them only to carry out the service they are providing for The Weather Channel.

If we buy a business, we will honor the requests of that business' former customers regarding their personally identifiable information. If in connection with a sale there will be material changes to the way personally identifiable information is being used, affected consumers will be notified via e-mail and will be given the opportunity to opt-out.
