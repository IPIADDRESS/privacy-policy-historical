        <p>
            PACT wants to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you

            We do our best to provide you with a safe and convenient shopping experience.
            When you enter your personal information on wearPACT.com, we use Secure Sockets
            Layer (SSL) technology to protect your information as it is transmitted to us
