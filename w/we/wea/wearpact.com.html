        <p>
            We may collect personal information from you, such as your name, email address,
            postal address, phone number, and credit card number when you place an order
            online or by phone, create an account with us online, contact us with a
            question or concern, or participate in a contest, promotion, or survey. We only

            When you visit wearPACT.com, we collect navigational information, such as

        <p>
            PACT wants to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you
            prefer not to receive promotional information, such as information about
            special offers and sales events, you can let us know by contacting us at
            <a href="mailto:info@wearPACT.com">info@wearPACT.com</a>

            Please be sure to include your full name and the email address you used when
            you registered with or made a purchase on wearPACT.com or by phone. If you ask
            us to remove your name and address from promotional lists, we will maintain
            your name in a "do not contact" file to ensure that we can honor your
            request. It may take up to 10 days to process your email request, during which
            period you may continue to receive communications from us.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Please note that when you make additional purchases at wearPACT.com or by
            phone, we will continue to confirm your order status and shipment by email. We
            may also need to contact you via telephone, email or postal mail with questions
            or information regarding your order.

        <p>
            We do our best to provide you with a safe and convenient shopping experience.
            When you enter your personal information on wearPACT.com, we use Secure Sockets
            Layer (SSL) technology to protect your information as it is transmitted to us
            and then to Authorize.net for payment processing. If you have accessed our
            secure server, the first characters of the address in the URL should change
            from "http" to "https".
        </p>

        <p>
            "Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you
            receive an email that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal
            information, do NOT respond. We will never request your password, user name,
            credit card information or other personal information through email.
