					<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="text_detail">
			   
							  <p style="font-size: 20px;">We value your trust</p>
								<p>The
										Privacy Policy sets forth our policies regarding the
										collection, use and protection of the personal information of
										those using the WeAreHolidays.co.in website. Personal
										information means information that can be linked to a specific
										individual, such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail
										address, and credit card number.</p>
							
								<p>We encourage you to review
										our Privacy Policy, and become familiar with it, but you
										should know that we do not sell or rent our customers'
										personal information to third parties.</p>
								
								<p>Please note that we review
										our Privacy Policy from time to time, and we may make periodic
										changes to the policy in connection with that review.
										Therefore, you may wish to bookmark this page and/or
										periodically review this page to make sure you have the latest
										version. Regardless of later updates, we will abide by the
										privacy practices described to you in this Privacy Policy at
										the time you provided us with your personal information.</p>
								
								<h4>What personal information we
										collect from you and how we use it?</h4>
								
								<p>When
										browsing our site, you are not required to provide any
										personal information unless and until you choose to make a
										purchase or sign up for one of our e-mail newsletters or other
										services as described below.</p>
								<h4><i>Making a Purchase</i></h4>
								<p>In
										order to purchase travel and/or related services through our
										site, you must provide us with certain personal information
										such as your name, payment instrument details such as your
										credit card number and expiration date, credit card billing
										address, telephone number, e-mail address and the name or
										names of the person(s) travelling (if not you). We may also
										ask you for other personal information, such as your frequent
										traveller numbers. We require this information to process,
										fulfil and confirm your reservations and transactions and keep
										you informed of each transaction's status. If you are making a
										reservation for one or more travellers other than yourself,
										you must confirm and represent that each of these other
										travellers have agreed, in advance, that you may disclose
										their personal information to us.</p>
								<h4><i>Member Registration</i></h4>
								<p>If
										you choose to become a registered member of WeAreHolidays.co.in
										site, you must provide your name, address, telephone number,
										e-mail address, a unique login name, password, and password
										validation, and a password hint to help you remember your
										password. This information is collected on the registration
										form for several reasons including but not limited to:</p>
								 <ul class="static_page_lists">
									<li>Personal identification</li>
									<li>To complete holiday, air,
												hotel, car, and other reservations</li>
									<li>To allow us to contact you
												for customer service purposes, if necessary</li>
									<li>To customize the content
												of our site to strive to meet your specific needs; and/or</li>
									<li>To make product or other
												improvements to our site. In addition, we need your e-mail
												address to confirm your new member registration and each
												reservation you transact on our site. As a WeAreHolidays.co.in
												site member you will also occasionally receive updates from
												us about fare sales in your area, special offers, new
												WeAreHolidays services, and other noteworthy items. However,
												you may choose at any time to no longer receive these types
												of e-mail messages. Please see our Opt-out Policy described
												below for details.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h4><i>Member Profile</i></h4>
								
								<p>As
										a WeAreHolidays.co.in site member, you can choose to complete
										your online profile by providing us with travel preferences,
										frequent - traveller or affinity numbers, credit card billing
										information, paper vouchers / ticket delivery address, and
										other personal information. This information is primarily used
										to assist you in making reservations quickly without having to
										type in the same information repeatedly. </p>
								<h4><i>Online Surveys</i></h4>
								
								<p>WeAreHolidays
										values opinions and comments from members, so we frequently
										conduct online surveys. Participation in these surveys is
										entirely voluntary and optional. Typically, the information is
										aggregated, and used to make improvements to the
										WeAreHolidays.co.in site and its services and to develop
										appealing content, features and promotions for
										WeAreHolidays.co.in site members. Survey participants are
										anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey.</p>
								
								<h4><i>Promotions &amp; Sweepstakes</i></h4>
								
								<p>WeAreHolidays
										frequently sponsors promotions and sweepstakes to give
										WeAreHolidays.co.in site members the opportunity to win great
										travel and travel - related prizes. Information collected by
										us for such activities may include contact information and
										survey questions. We use contact information to notify contest
										winners and survey information to develop promotions and
										product improvements to the WeAreHolidays.co.in site.</p>
								
								<h4><i>Automatic Logging of Session
										Data</i></h4>
								
								<p>We
										automatically log generic information about your computer's
										connection to the Internet, which we call "session data", that
										is anonymous and not linked to any personal information.
										Session data consists of things such as IP address, operating
										system and type of browser software being used and the
										activities conducted by the user while on WeAreHolidays.co.in
										site. We collect session data because it helps us analyse such
										things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the
										way visitors are clicking through the site, how many visitors
										are surfing to various pages on the site, how long visitors to
										the site are staying and how often they are visiting. It also
										helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better
										administer our systems. Although such information does not
										identify any visitor personally, it is possible to determine
										from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider
										(ISP), and the approximate geographic location of his or her
										point of connectivity.</p>
								
								<h4><i>Cookies</i></h4>
								
								<p>"Cookies"
										are small pieces of information that are stored by your
										browser on your computer's hard drive. There are many myths
										circulating about cookies, but you should know that cookies
										are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable
										to do such things as run programs on your computer, plant
										viruses or harvest your personal information. The use of
										cookies is very common on the Internet and WeAreHolidays's use
										of cookies is similar to that of such sites as MakeMyTrip,
										Expedia and Orbitz, as well as Yahoo!, CNN.com and other
										reputable online companies.</p>
								
								<p>First
										and foremost, you can rest assured that no personally
										identifiable information ("PII") about you (e.g., name,
										address, etc.) is gathered or stored in the cookies placed by
										the WeAreHolidays.co.in site and, as a result, none can be
										passed on to any third parties.</p>
								
								<p>Cookies
										allow us to serve you better and more efficiently, and to
										personalize your experience at our site. WeAreHolidays uses
										cookies to personalize your experience on the
										WeAreHolidays.co.in site, and with respect to advertisements. As
										to the former, these types of cookies allow you to log in
										without having to type your log - in name each time (only your
										password is needed. We may also use such cookies to display an
										advertisement to you while you are on WeAreHolidays.co.in site
										or to send you a "Best Day to Buy" email (or similar emails -
										assuming you have not opted out of receiving such emails)
										focusing on destinations in which we think you might be
										interested. None of this information is passed to any third
										party, and is used solely by us to provide you with a better
										user experience on WeAreHolidays.co.in site.</p>
								
								<p>A
										cookie may also be placed by our advertising server. Such
										cookies are used only for purposes of tracking the
										effectiveness of advertising served by us on our site and no
										PII is gathered from you by the use of these cookies, nor is
										this information shared with any third parties. Similarly, a
										cookie may be placed by our third - party advertising
										companies. These companies may use aggregated statistics about
										your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide
										advertisements about travel - related goods and services that
										you may be interested in. The information they collect does
										not include your PII.</p>
								
								<p>The
										third party advertising companies may also employ technology
										that is used to measure the effectiveness of ads. Any such
										information is anonymous. They may use this anonymous
										information about your visits to this and other sites in order
										to provide advertisements about goods and services of
										potential interest to you. No PII is collected during this
										process. The information is anonymous, and does not link
										online actions to an identifiable person. </p>
								
								<p>Most
										Web browsers automatically accept cookies. Of course, by
										changing the options on your web browser or using certain
										software programs, you can control how and whether cookies
										will be accepted by your browser. WeAreHolidays supports your
										right to block any unwanted Internet activity, especially that
										of unscrupulous websites. However, blocking WeAreHolidays
										cookies may disable certain features on the WeAreHolidays.co.in
										site, and may make it impossible to purchase or use certain
										services available on the WeAreHolidays.co.in site. Please note
										that it is possible to block cookie activity from certain
										websites while permitting cookies from sites you trust, like
										WeAreHolidays.</p>
								<h4><i>Other</i></h4>
								
								<p>From
										time to time we may add or enhance services available on
										WeAreHolidays.co.in site. To the extent these services are
										provided, and used by you, we will use the information you
										provide to facilitate the service requested. For example, if
										you email us with a question, we will use your email address,
										name, nature of the question, etc. to respond to your
										question. We may also store such information to assist us in
										making the site the better and easier to use.</p>
								
								<h4>With whom (if anyone) is
										your personal information is shared?</h4>
								
								<p>When
										you reserve or purchase travel services through WeAreHolidays,
										we must provide certain of your personal information to the
										airline, hotel, car - rental agency, travel agency or other
										involved third party to enable the successful fulfilment of
										your travel arrangements. However, we do not sell or rent
										individual customer names or other personal information to
										third parties. We use non-personally identifiable information
										in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful online
										services by performing statistical analysis of the collective
										characteristics and behaviour of our customers and visitors,
										and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific
										areas of the WeAreHolidays.co.in Site. We may provide anonymous
										statistical information based on this data to suppliers,
										advertisers, affiliates and other current and potential
										business partners. We may also use such aggregate data to
										inform these third parties as to the number of people who have
										seen and clicked on links to their web sites. Occasionally,
										WeAreHolidays will hire a third party to act on our behalf for
										projects such as market research surveys and contest - entry
										processing and will provide information to these third parties
										specifically for use in connection with these projects. The
										information we provide to such third parties is protected by a
										confidentiality agreement and is to be used solely for
										completing the specific project.</p>
								
								<h4>How you can opt-out of
										receiving our promotional e-mails?</h4>
								
								<p>At
										any time, you may unsubscribe from our Top Deals, or other
										newsletter or similar services through the "My Account" link
										on the WeAreHolidays.co.in site home page. As a member or
										promotion/sweepstakes entrant, you will occasionally receive
										e-mail updates from us about fare sales in your area, special
										offers, new WeAreHolidays services, and other noteworthy
										items. We hope you will find these updates interesting and
										informative. Of course, if you would rather not receive them,
										please click on the "unsubscribe" link or follow the
										instructions in each e-mail message or send us an email
										unsubscribe@weareholidays.com. WeAreHolidays reserves the
										right to limit membership to those who will accept e-mails.
										Members will be notified via e-mail prior to any actions
										taken.</p>
								
								
							<h4>What safeguards we have in
										place to protect your personal information?</h4>
								
								<p>All
										payments on the WeAreHolidays.co.in site is SSL secured. This
										means all personal information you provide to WeAreHolidays is
										transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is
										a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically
										encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. The same
										process happens when you make travel purchases on the
										WeAreHolidays.co.in site.</p>
								
							<p>	<b>What other information
										should I know about my privacy?	</b>	</p>					
								<p>WeAreHolidays.co.in
										site contains links to other web sites. Please note that when
										you click on one of these links, you are entering another web
										site for which WeAreHolidays has no responsibility. We
										encourage you to read the privacy statements of all such sites
										as their policies may be materially different from this
										Privacy Policy. Of course, you are solely responsible for
										maintaining the secrecy of your passwords, and your
										WeAreHolidays.co.in site membership account information. Please
										be very careful, responsible, and alert with this information,
										especially whenever you're online.</p>
								
								<p>In
										addition to the circumstances described above, WeAreHolidays
										may disclose the WeAreHolidays.co.in site member information if
										required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other
										government or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith
										belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable
										including, without limitation, to protect the rights or
										properties of WeAreHolidays or any or all of its affiliates,
										associates, employees, directors or officers or when we have
										reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary
										to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who
										may be causing interference with our rights or properties,
										whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could
										be harmed by such activities. In addition, if WeAreHolidays or
										substantially all of its assets are acquired, our customer
										information will most likely also be transferred in connection
										with such acquisition</p>.
								
								<p>This
										policy is effective as of October 1, 2011. Any material
										changes in the way WeAreHolidays uses personal information
										will be described in future versions of this Privacy
										Statement. Of course, you may always submit concerns regarding
										our Privacy Statement or our privacy practices via email to
										privacy@weareholidays.com. Please reference the privacy policy
										in your subject line. WeAreHolidays will attempt to respond to
										all reasonable concerns or inquiries within seven working days
										of receipt.</p>
								
								<p>We
										look forward to having the opportunity to serve you!!</p>
