          <p>Wealthsimple is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information in our possession and control. This Privacy Policy explains the measures we take to fulfill these commitments and describes the manner in which Wealthsimple collects, uses, discloses and otherwise treats personal information through our website available at <a href="http://www.wealthsimple.com">wealthsimple.com</a>, including all subpages and successor pages (collectively referred to as the "Website") as well as through other interactions with our clients and prospective clients.</p>
        
          <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes to our personal information practices. We strongly encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy often for the latest information about our personal information practices.</p>
        
          <h2 class="subheader copy-xlg">We ask our clients for no more personal information than necessary.</h2>
        
          <p>Wealthsimple needs to collect personal information from our clients and prospective clients in order to provide services to you and fulfill our legal obligations. Understanding a client's needs and wants, financial position and family issues enables us to ensure that all investment recommendations are suitable. This is both a regulatory requirement and good business. Wealthsimple is committed to protecting our clients' privacy and the confidentiality of their personal information in our possession. This memorandum explains the measures we take to fulfill these commitments.</p>
        
          <p>The "Know Your Client" information forms we ask clients to complete elicit only the information we need for contractual, regulatory and income tax requirements including: name, address, phone and fax numbers, email addresses, birth date, social insurance numbers (for tax reporting purposes), asset holdings and values, investment knowledge and objectives. We also collect your chequing account information and optional beneficiary information (e.g. spouse's name and occupation, children's and dependents' names and ages).</p>
        
          <p>Our application forms for registered retirement accounts elicit only the information needed to register these accounts with the government including: social insurance number, spouse's or designated beneficiary's name and birth date. We do not disclose any non-public personal information to any third party except as required by law or as outlined in this Policy. We also collect your responses to a risk questionnaire and other regulatory questions that we are required by law to collect.</p>
        
          <h2 class="subheader copy-xlg">We limit the use of your personal information.</h2>
        
          <p>The personal information we collect when you open an account is used for the following purposes:</p>
        
          <ul>
            <li>helping us choose the portfolio that best fits you and your needs;</li>
            <li>verifying your identity [and other information you have provided to us];</li>
            <li>opening and servicing your account;</li>
            <li>sending and receiving bill payments through your chequing account;</li>
            <li>detecting and preventing fraud and other unauthorized or illegal activities;</li>
            <li>meeting legal and regulatory requirements; and</li>
            <li>as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.</li>
