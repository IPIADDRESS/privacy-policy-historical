                      <p>W2U and its subsidiaries respect your privacy and are 
                        committed to protecting it. W2U provides this Privacy 
                        Statement to inform you of our Privacy Policy and practices 
                        and of the choices you can make about the way your information 
                        is collected online and how that information is used. 
                        We've structured our websites so that, in general, you 
                        can visit W2U on the Web without identifying yourself 
                        or revealing any personal information. We make this notice 
                        readily available on our home page and at the bottom of every 
                        W2U Web page.</p>
                      <p>1. Sites covered by this Privacy Statement</p>
                      <p>This Privacy Statement applies to all W2U.com-owned websites 
                        and domains, and our wholly owned subsidiaries ("W2U 
                        websites.") </p>
                      <p>Links to non-W2U websites<br>
                        The W2U websites may provide links to third-party websites 
                        for your convenience and information. If you access those 
                        links, you will leave the W2U website. W2U does not control 
                        those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ 
                        from W2U's. We do not endorse or make any representations 
                        about third-party websites. The personal data you choose 
                        to give to unrelated third parties is not covered by the 
                        W2U Privacy Statement. We encourage you to review the 
                        privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal 
                        information. Some third-party companies may choose to 
                        share their personal data with W2U; that sharing is governed 
                        by that third-party company's privacy policy. </p>
                      <p>2. Personal Information We Collect Online</p>
                      <p>This Privacy Statement covers personal information, non-personal 
                        data collection and aggregate reporting. <br>
                        Personal information is information that is associated 
                        with your name or personal identity. W2U uses personal 
                        information to understand better your needs and interests 
                        and to provide you with better service. Once you choose 
                        to provide us with personal information, you can be assured 
                        it will be used only to support your customer relationship 
                        with W2U. We take seriously the trust you place in us. 
                        W2U will not sell, rent or lease your personal information 
                        to others.</p>
                      <p>On some W2U websites, you can order products or services, 
                        request information, subscribe to marketing or support 
                        materials, register yourself or your W2U products, or 
                        apply for a job at W2U. The types of personal information 
                        you provide to us on these pages may include name, address, 
                        phone number, e-mail address, user IDs and passwords, 
                        billing and transaction information, credit card information, 
                        contact preferences, educational and employment background, 
                        and job interest data.</p>
                      <p>To personalize our websites, services or communications 
                        and improve our products and services, we may also ask 
                        you to provide us with information regarding your personal 
                        or professional interests, demographics, and experiences 
                        with our products or services. Providing this additional 
                        information is optional.</p>
                      <p>Non-personal information<br>
                        is data about usage and service operation that is not 
                        associated with a specific personal identity. W2U collects 
                        and analyzes non-personal information to evaluate how 
                        visitors use the W2U websites. </p>
                      <p>Non-personal data we collect may include the pages visited 
                        on the W2U websites, unique URLs1 visited within W2U.com, 
                        browser type and IP2 address. Most non-personal data is 
                        collected via cookies or other analysis technologies. 
                        W2U.com Web pages use cookies, Web beacons and other technologies 
                        for data analysis and personalization services. W2U also 
                        places ads on other websites that may use cookies. </p>
                      <p>3. Children's privacy</p>
                      <p>W2U is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children 
                        and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active 
                        role in their children's online activities and interests. 
                        W2U does not knowingly collect information from children 
                        under the age of 13 and W2U does not target its websites 
                        to children under 13. </p>
                      <p>4. How we use your information</p>
                      <p>W2U uses your personal information to provide you with 
                        services and to help us better understand your needs and 
                        interests. Specifically, we use your information to help 
                        you complete a transaction or order, to communicate with 
                        you, to provide service and support, to update you on 
                        services and benefits, to personalize promotional offers 
                        and to personalize some W2U websites. Occasionally we 
                        may also use your information to contact you for market 
                        research regarding W2U products or services. We will give 
                        you the opportunity to choose your privacy preferences 
                        regarding such communications. Credit card information 
                        is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention. 
                        Credit card information and sensitive personal data are 
                        not used for any other purpose by our financial services 
                        providers or W2U and will not be kept longer than necessary 
                        for providing the services, unless you ask us to retain 
                        your credit card information for future purchases. </p>
                      <p>In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized 
                        experience in your interactions with W2U, information collected 
                        through one W2U service may be combined with information 
                        obtained through other W2U services. </p>
                      <p>W2U is a global organization, with legal entities, business 
                        processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders. Our privacy practices are designed 
                        to provide protection for your personal information, all 
                        over the world. We may share your personal information 
                        within W2U and transfer it to countries in the world where 
                        we do business. Some countries may provide less legal 
                        protection for your information. In such countries W2U 
                        will still handle information in the manner we describe 
                        here. </p>
                      <p>Non-personal data is aggregated for reporting about W2U 
                        website usability, performance and effectiveness. It is 
                        used to improve the customer experience, usability and 
                        site content.</p>
                      <p>5. Who we share your information with</p>
                      <p>W2U will not sell, rent or lease your personal information 
                        to others. W2U will not share your personal information 
                        with third parties except in responding to your requests 
                        for products or services. Your permission will be requested 
                        when you submit your information. W2U shares customer information 
                        across companies working on our behalf and W2U-owned business 
                        entities, but only as described above in "How we 
                        use your information." </p>
                      <p>W2U contracts with third-party service providers and suppliers 
                        to deliver complete products, services and customer solutions 
                        described in "How we use your information." 
                        Suppliers and service providers are required to keep confidential 
                        the information received on behalf of W2U and may not use 
                        it for any purpose other than to carry out the services 
                        they are performing for W2U. These service providers may 
                        change or we may contract with additional service providers 
                        to better accommodate our customers. </p>
                      <p>W2U will not share personal information with any other 
                        third parties without your permission, unless to: (i) 
                        respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental 
                        authorities; (ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, 
                        or court order, (iii) help prevent fraud or to enforce 
                        or protect the rights and properties of W2U or its subsidiaries; 
                        or (iv) to protect the personal safety of W2U employees 
                        and third parties on W2U property. </p>
                      <p>Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic 
                        or other business reasons, W2U decides to sell, buy, merge 
                        or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. 
                        Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal 
                        information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving 
                        it from sellers. It is W2U’s practice to seek appropriate 
                        protection for information in these types of transactions. 
                      </p>
                      <p>6. Your choices</p>
                      <p>W2U gives you the choice of receiving a variety of information 
                        that complements our products and services. You can subscribe 
                        to receive certain product- and service-specific information 
                        and W2U-wide marketing communications. W2U-wide communications 
                        may include new product information, special offers, or 
                        an invitation to participate in market research. We give 
                        you a choice regarding delivery of W2U-wide communications 
                        by postal mail, e-mail and telephone. You can make or 
                        change your choices at the data collection point or through 
                        W2U Passport (W2U's proprietary online customer registration 
                        tool, available only in the Europe). We will make every 
                        effort to honor your preferences.</p>
                      <p>7. Your information and third-party companies</p>
                      <p>Certain W2U services are linked with those from unrelated 
                        third-party companies, some which offer you the option 
                        to share with both W2U and the third party personal data 
                        you provide. Examples include the ability to register 
                        software products from multiple vendors from a single 
                        W2U Web page, to request communications from W2U marketing 
                        or solution partners, or to enable order completion through 
                        a reseller. We will not share your personal information 
                        with those third-party companies unless you make that 
                        choice. </p>
                      <p>8. Access to and accuracy of your information</p>
                      <p>W2U strives to keep your personal information accurate. 
                        We have implemented technology, management processes and 
                        policies to maintain customer data accuracy. We will provide 
                        you with access to your information, including making 
                        reasonable effort to provide you with online access and 
                        the opportunity to change your information. To protect 
                        your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable 
                        steps to verify your identity, such as a password and 
                        user ID, before granting access to your data. Certain 
                        areas of W2U's websites may limit access to specific individuals 
                        through the use of passwords and other personal identifiers.</p>
                      <p>The most effective way to view and change your personal 
                        information is to return to the Web page where you originally 
                        submitted your data and follow the instructions on that 
                        Web page or use W2U Passport. </p>
                      <p>9. Keeping your information secure</p>
                      <p>W2U is committed to protecting the information you provide 
                        us. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain 
                        data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the 
                        information, W2U has in place appropriate physical and 
                        managerial procedures to safeguard the information we 
                        collect. </p>
                      <p>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting 
                        or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information. 
                        SSL encryption is designed to make the information unreadable 
                        by anyone but us. This security measure is working when 
                        you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed 
                        lock (depending on your browser) on the bottom of your 
                        browser window.</p>
                      <p>Credit card numbers are used only for processing payment 
                        and are not used for other purposes. As part of real-time 
                        payment processing, W2U subscribes to a fraud management 
                        service. This service gives you and W2U an extra level 
                        of security to guard against credit card fraud to protect 
                        your financial data. </p>
                      <p>10. Changes to this Statement</p>
                      <p>If there are updates to the terms of W2U's Online Privacy 
                        Statement, we will post those changes and update the revision 
                        date in this document, so you will always know what information 
                        we collect online, how we use it, and what choices you 
                        have. For material changes to this Statement, W2U will 
                        provide notification to affected customers. </p>
                      <p>11. Give Us Your Feedback </p>
                      <p>Our goal is to protect your privacy. If you have comments 
                        or questions about our privacy policy, please send them
