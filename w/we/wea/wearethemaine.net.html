    information through the Site: "<b>Personally
    Identifiable Information</b>" (or "<b>PII</b>") and "<b>Non-Personally
    Identifiable Information</b>" (or "<b>Non-PII</b>").&nbsp; Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies you
    as an individual; that is, your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail
    address, credit card number or other payment account number.&nbsp; Non-Personally Identifiable Information
    is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other
    information that does not reveal your specific identity. </span></p>

    for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Site
    (for example, to sign up for a newsletter or to view certain areas of the
    Site), we may require that you furnish PII.&nbsp; We collect PII from you through the Site only when you

    Site, Company and third parties with whom Company has contracted to provide
    services to Company may collect Non-PII (for example, a catalog of the Site
    pages you visit).&nbsp; Non-PII is
    generally collected through the Site from five different sources:&nbsp; <span class="GramE">server log</span> files, environmental variables, cookies, pixel tags and other similar
    technologies and information that you voluntarily provide.&nbsp; <b> </b></span></p>

    that you visited.&nbsp; We use your IP
    address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating
    Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site's servers, and
    administering the Site.&nbsp; Collecting
    IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by

    computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet

    used to optimize your experience on the Site. </span></p>

    most web sites, and can facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of a
    particular web site; cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or
    files.&nbsp; If you do not want
    information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure
