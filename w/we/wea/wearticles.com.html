	<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="color:#000;">WeArticles.com® – PRIVACY POLICY<br>
	[Effective as of November 1st, 2013]<br>
	Address: WeArticles®, Los Angeles, CA 90046.<br>
	WeArticles® (“WeArticles,”<br>
	WeArticles.COM,” ) is deeply committed to respecting and protecting<br>
	the privacy and security rights of users and the information you share with us at the WeArticles website<br>
	(the “Website”). WeArticles created this Privacy Policy to give you (“You” or “Your”) assurance of<br>
	WeArticles’s commitment to fair information practices and to the protection of Your privacy as You<br>
	visit and use the Website (the “Privacy Policy”).<br>
	We believe YOU have the right to know everything regarding the information we collect about<br>
	YOU, how this information benefits You, and how you can say “no” to the use of any of this<br>
	information. This Privacy Policy explains what we do with your information and what You can<br>
	expect from WeArticles. By using the Website, You indicate your acceptance of WeArticles’s Privacy Policy.<br>
	WeArticles’s data collection and retention practices are designed to provide transparency,<br>
	accountability and choice regarding the management and use of Your personal information<br>
	(“Personal Information”). If You have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy<br>
	or practices, please contact us at via e-mail at " admin@WeArticles.com. This Privacy<br>
	Policy is only applicable to the Website and not to any websites of third-parties (“Third-Party<br>
	Websites”), which may have data collection, storage and use practices and policies that differ<br>
	materially from this Privacy Policy. You should consult privacy policies for all other sites, as<br>
	WeArticles has no control over information submitted to or collected by such third-parties.<br>
	You may visit WeArticles at any time without providing Your identity or revealing any personal<br>
	information about yourself. However, when You visit our Website, we may collect and store<br>
	Your computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from WeArticles,<br>
	ad data, IP address and standard web log information, and information from other companies,<br>
	such as demographic and navigation data. In order to be approved as registered user with WeArticles,<br>
	You will be required to choose a user-name. This user-name may be displayed throughout WeArticles<br>
	and therefore provided to the public. Unless You associate your user-name with Your Personal<br>
	Information, users will not be able to personally identify Your activities on WeArticles.<br>
	When visiting WeArticles from a public or shared computer, certain information about You, such as<br>
	Your user-name, may also be visible to others who may use the computer after Your use.<br>
	BY USING THE WEBSITE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE<br>
	READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY<br>
	POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY<br>
	THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY LEAVE THE WEBSITE.<br>
	WeArticles has been awarded TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices<br>
	have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe’s program requirements:(http:/<br>
	&nbsp;"http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-" www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy- programs-<br>
	requirements.html) including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection<br>
	and use of your personal information. The TRUSTe program does not cover information that<br>
	may be collected through downloadable software. TRUSTe’s mission, as an independent third<br>
	party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its<br>
	leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions. If you have questions or complaints<br>

	1. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY<br>
	We care about the safety of children. WeArticles does not solicit or knowingly collect Personal<br>
	Information from children under the age of 13. Children should always get permission from<br>
	their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as, their names, e-<br>
	mail addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet to us or to anyone else. We encourage<br>
	You to become involved in Your children’s on-line experience and to share Your interest in our<br>
	Website with Your young ones. If WeArticles obtains actual knowledge that it has collected Personal<br>
	Information from a child under the age of 13, WeArticles will immediately delete such information<br>
	from its database.<br>
	2. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES<br>
	WeArticles collects Personal Information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information<br>
	to us on the Website and through e-mail. When visiting the Website, we collect user-specific<br>
	information on what pages are visited.<br>
	Personal Information<br>
	When You register for our service, You will be asked to provide WeArticles certain Personal<br>
	Information. Personal Information includes, without limitation: Your first name, last<br>
	name, user-name, password, e-mail address, gender, date of birth, city, state, and zip<br>
	code. The Website will not gather Personal Information surreptitiously.<br>
	In general, once You provide us with Your required Personal Information, You are no<br>
	longer anonymous. In providing us with Your Personal Information, You consent to<br>
	the transfer and storage of such information on our servers. In addition to the foregoing<br>
	Personal Information in connection with your registration and use of WeArticles, we may<br>
	collect and store the following Personal Information:<br>
	• all transactional information based on your activities on WeArticles;<br>
	• any correspondence sent to us; and<br>
	• other supplemental information from third-parties.<br>
	Our primary purpose in collecting Personal Information is to provide You with a safe,<br>
	smooth, efficient, and customized experience. You agree that we may use Your Personal<br>
	Information to:<br>
	provide the services and customer support You request;<br>
	resolve disputes;<br>
	troubleshoot problems;<br>
	prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities;<br>
	enforce our Terms and Conditions;<br>
	customize, measure and improve our services, content and advertising; and<br>
	inform you about our services, targeted marketing, service updates, and<br>
	promotional offers.<br>
	Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect Your privacy and our ability to<br>
	keep the community free from bad actors, WeArticles will maintain an e-mail database,<br>
	in-house, and will never sell Your data, to include postal and/or e-mail address(es).<br>
	Further, we will not otherwise disclose Your Personal Information to law enforcement,<br>
	other government officials, or other third-parties without a subpoena, court order or<br>
	substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the<br>
	disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial<br>
	loss or to report suspected illegal activity.<br>
	Traffic Data<br>
	Like most website operators, WeArticles automatically gathers information of the sort that<br>
	browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) domain servers;<br>
	(iii) types of computers accessing the Website; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing<br>
	the Website (collectively “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that<br>
	does not personally identify You.<br>
	Cookies<br>
	WeArticles uses so-called “Cookies,” which are files that are stored on Your computer that<br>
	can be retrieved to assist in customizing Your experience with the online service.<br>
	A “Cookie” is a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and<br>
	that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the<br>
	website. The purpose of a “Cookie” is to (1) support the functionality of the Website,<br>
	for example by keeping track of Your visual preferences or controlling the frequency<br>
	of “WeArticles-up” windows, and (2) identify the user as a unique user of the Website.<br>
	WeArticles uses “Cookies” to customize Your experience on the Website to Your interests, to<br>
	ensure that You do not repeatedly see content or informational messages that may be of<br>
	no interest to You, and to store Your password so You do not have to re-enter it each<br>
	time You visit the Website.<br>
	If You want to disable “Cookies,” there is a simple procedure in most Internet browsers<br>
	that allows You to turn-off “Cookies.” Please remember, however, that “Cookies” may<br>
	be required to allow You to use certain features of the Website.<br>
	For additional information on WeArticles’s uses of “Cookies,” see the section concerning<br>
	Information Use and Disclosure Practices, below.<br>
	IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE “COOKIES” PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER,<br>
	YOU SHOULD ADJUST THE CORRESPONDING SETTING IN YOUR BROWSER<br>
	TO REFUSE “COOKIES” BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE<br>
	UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN OF THE SERVICES AND CERTAIN<br>
	FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT<br>
	THE AID OF “COOKIES.” IF YOU REFUSE “COOKIES,” YOU ASSUME ALL<br>
	RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.<br>
	Web Beacons/Web Bugs<br>
	WeArticles utilizes a software technology called “clear gifs” (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs),<br>
	that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.<br>
	Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to “Cookies,” and<br>
	are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to “Cookies,” which<br>
	are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web<br>
	pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the<br>
	information gathered by clear gifs to our customer’s Personal Information. Rather, we<br>
	use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails have been opened<br>
	by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and<br>
	the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.<br>
	Some of our Third-Party Websites (e.g., Third-Party Advertising Promotions) use “Cookies” and<br>
	Web Beacons on the Website. We have no access to or control over these third-party tracking<br>
	technologies.<br>
	You are under no obligation to provide Personal Information, with the caveat that Your refusal to<br>
	do so may prevent You from using certain of the Services.<br>
	3. INFORMATION USE AND DISCLOSURE PRACTICES<br>
	(a) Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using “Cookies”<br>
	WeArticles analyzes Traffic Data and information gathered using “Cookies” to help WeArticles better<br>
	understand who is using the Website and how they are using it. By identifying patterns and<br>
	trends in usage, WeArticles is able to better design the Website to improve Your experience, and to<br>
	serve You more relevant and interesting content and third-party advertising promotions. From<br>
	time to time, WeArticles may release Traffic Data and information gathered using “Cookies” in the<br>
	aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website. WeArticles does not<br>
	attempt to link information gathered using “Cookies” to Personal Information.<br>
	(b) Personal Information<br>
	Generally, WeArticles uses Your Personal Information to send You information about WeArticles and WeArticles’s-<br>
	products and services, and to contact You when necessary in connection with the Services.<br>
	WeArticles uses Your Demographic Data to customize and tailor Your experience on the Website.<br>
	Except under the following circumstances, WeArticles will keep Your Personal Information private,<br>
	and will not share it with third-parties.<br>
	Third-Party Marketing: By submitting Your Personal Information<br>
	to us and opting-in, You grant us the right, subject to applicable<br>
	state and federal law, to use that Personal Information for marketing<br>
	purposes. We may rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute any and all<br>
	Personal Information with or to any third-party for any and all uses<br>
	permitted by this Privacy Policy and applicable law. These third-<br>
	parties may include: (a) providers of the products and/or service that<br>
	you requested and/or won by and through our Website; (b) providers<br>
	of direct marketing services and applications; (c) e-mail marketers;<br>
	(d) telemarketers; and (e) direct marketers; and<br>
	WeArticles discloses Personal Information to those who help it provide services,<br>
	including those who perform technical, administrative and data processing<br>
	tasks such as hosting, fulfillment, and data storage and security. These<br>
	service providers are prohibited from using this Personal Information for<br>
	any other purpose including their own marketing purposes; and<br>
	WeArticles discloses Personal Information when required to do so by law, or in<br>
	response to a subpoena or court order, or when WeArticles believes in its sole<br>
	discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or<br>
	rights of WeArticles, third-parties, or the public at large; and<br>
	WeArticles reserves the right to transfer all Personal Information in its<br>
	possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger,<br>
	acquisition, or bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of WeArticles’s assets.<br>
	Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use<br>
	and disclosure of all transferred Personal Information will be subject to<br>
	this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if You are given notice<br>
	of that new privacy policy and an opportunity to affirmatively opt-out of<br>
	it. Personal Information submitted or collected after a transfer, however,<br>
	may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by a WeArticles successor<br>
	organization.<br>
	(c) Opting-In<br>
	WeArticles does not share Personal Information with anyone, unless You “opt in” to having Your<br>
	information shared with third-parties, or we have informed You of a change to our Privacy<br>
	Policy so that You can then choose to opt-out. It’s that simple.<br>
	If you have opted-in to receiving information from third-parties, we will provide You with a way<br>
	to tell us that You no longer want us to share Personal Information and that You no longer want<br>
	to receive promotional and/or marketing information about products, services, and offerings<br>
	from any third-parties. We will also provide You with a way to update the Personal Information<br>
	that You share with us during registration. Once You have “opted-in” and agreed that Your<br>
	information may be shared with third-parties or You have responded directly to an offer by<br>
	any third-party on the WeArticles Website, WeArticles will not be able to update any of Your Personal<br>
	Information that has been transferred to such third-parties or opt You out of such third-parties<br>
	so that You no longer receive their promotional and/or marketing information. Instead, You<br>
	must either contact that third-party or refer to their individual privacy policy to update Your<br>
	Personal Information, or to let them know that You no longer want to receive promotional and/or<br>
	marketing information about their products, services, or offerings.<br>
	4. CONSENT TO RECEIVE E-MAIL FROM WeArticles<br>
	By establishing an account with WeArticles, You consent to receive periodic commercial/promotional<br>
	e-mail communications from WeArticles concerning WeArticles – products and services. You may opt-out<br>
	of receiving such communications at any time by (a) following the unsubscribe instructions<br>
	contained in each e-mail; (b) sending an e-mail to&nbsp;&nbsp; " admin@WeArticles.com; (c)<br>
	writing to us at :&nbsp; Los Angeles, CA 90046.<br>
	5. SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION<br>
	WeArticles has implemented and maintains generally accepted industry standards to protect against the<br>
	unauthorized access, use, modification, destruction or disclosure of Your Personal Information<br>
	both during transmission and once we receive it. The security of Your personal information<br>
	is important to us. When you enter sensitive information during the registration process, we<br>
	encrypt that information using state-of-the-art technology.<br>
	However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%<br>
	secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your<br>
	personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br>
	WeArticles assures you that we will use Your e-mail address, with Your express consent, only for the<br>
	purposes stated in the Terms of Use. We will not otherwise rent or sell Your e-mail address<br>
	to third-parties, and we will prevent Your e-mail address from being recorded by “web<br>
	crawlers” or “web spiders” to the best of our ability. If You believe that your e-mail address<br>
	has been recorded in this way, please let us know immediately.<br>
	If You have any questions about security on our Website, You can e-mail us at<br>
	&nbsp;"mail to: admin@WeArticles.com."<br>
	6. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES<br>
	The Website includes links to other Third-Party Websites whose privacy practices may differ<br>
	from those of WeArticles. If You submit Personal Information to any of a Third-Party Website, your<br>
	Personal Information is governed by their privacy statements. WeArticles encourages You to carefully<br>
	read the privacy statement of any Third-Party Website You visit.<br>
	7. USER ABILITY TO ACCESS, UPDATE, AND CORRECT PERSONAL INFORMATION<br>
	WeArticles wants Your Personal Information to be complete and accurate. By using the Website, You<br>
	represent and warrant that all information You provide on any registration form or otherwise<br>
	in connection with Your use of the Website and Services will be complete and accurate, and<br>
	that You will update that information as necessary to maintain its completeness and accuracy.<br>
	To confirm the completeness and accuracy of, or make changes to, Your Personal<br>
	Information, please email us at&nbsp;&nbsp; "mail to:" admin@WeArticles.com.<br>
	8. PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES<br>
	From time to time, WeArticles may conduct contests, giveaways and other promotions<br>
	(collectively, “Promotional Activities”). Any information submitted in connection with<br>
	Promotional Activities will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time to time,<br>
	WeArticles may also ask You to participate in surveys designed to help WeArticles improve the Website or<br>
	services. Any Personal Information provided to WeArticles in connection with any survey will be<br>
	used only in relation to that survey, and may be disclosed to third-parties not bound by this<br>
	Privacy Policy only in aggregated form.<br>
	9. RULES FOR SUBMISSIONS AND MESSAGES IN CHAT ROOMS<br>
	If You use a bulletin board or chat room on the Website, You should be aware that any Personal<br>
	Information that You submit there can be read, collected and/or used by other users of those<br>
	forums, and could be used to send You unsolicited messages. Responsibility for what is posted<br>
	in the discussion groups or other public forums lies with each user – You alone are responsible<br>
	for the content of Your messages and the consequences of any such messages. We cannot and do<br>
	not review every submission a user may make. We neither endorse nor guarantee the accuracy or<br>
	propriety of any submission. We do, however, reserve the right but do not assume the obligation<br>
	to restrict or prohibit Your use of our Website if we believe you are violating any of the terms of<br>
	the agreement and to remove, edit, or relocate any submission as we see fit whether for legal or<br>
	other reasons.<br>
	We are not responsible for the Personal Information that You choose to submit in the Website<br>
	forums. We reserve the right to terminate the member status of anyone who uses the forums in a<br>
	manner inconsistent with our Terms of Service.<br>
	10. UPDATES AND CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY<br>
	If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, the<br>
	home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we<br>
	collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right<br>
	to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material<br>
	changes to this policy, we will notify You here, by e-mail, or by means of a notice on our home<br>
	page within thirty (30) days of such changes being made.<br>
	11. REVOKING CONSENT/DELETING YOUR ACCOUNT<br>
	You can delete or deactivate your WeArticles account at any time by e-mailing<br>
	" admin@WeArticles.com. When You delete your account, Your Personal Information<br>

	14. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS<br>
	A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third-parties for the third-parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third-parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third-parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.<br>
