<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<li>You become a User when you access the Site, pursuant to Wealthfront’s <a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/legal/terms">Terms of Use</a>. Except as required by law or requested by regulatory authorities, Wealthfront agrees to maintain your non-public information in strict confidence.</li>
<li>Wealthfront restricts access to non-public personal information about Users to certain Wealthfront employees who require that information in order to maintain and operate the Site. Wealthfront may ask you for additional personal information, such as your name or picture, in order to provide personalized services to you. Wealthfront stores, processes, and maintains data related to you in order to provide its products and services through the Site. Wealthfront’s uses for this data are described below.</li>
<li>When you use the Site, Wealthfront’s servers automatically record certain information about your use of the Site. Similar to other web services, Wealthfront records information such as browsing activity, data displayed or clicked on (such as UI elements, ads, and links), and other information (such as browser type, IP address, date and time of access, cookie ID, and referrer URL). Along with cookies, Wealthfront may also use third-party tracking technology, such as Google Analytics, to record similar information regarding you and your activity on the Site.</li>
<li>Wealthfront is not directed to anyone under the age of 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child under the age of 18 has provided us with personally identifiable information without his or her consent, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto:support@wealthfront.com">support@wealthfront.com</a>. If we become aware that a child under the age of 18 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such information from our files.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Information Sharing and Onward Transfer</h2>
<ul>
<li>We do not sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information with any third parties except as permitted or required by law, such as when we reasonably believe it is necessary or appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, frontrunning or scalping, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our Terms of Use.</li>
<li>You understand and agree that any personal information that you provide through the Site and explicitly agree to share publicly might be made publicly available in Wealthfront’s discretion, and that other Users may use and reproduce such.

<li>We may share the information required to become a Client with our brokerage partner solely for the purpose of allowing our brokerage partner to provide services to you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<ul>
<li>You may request deletion of personal information by emailing <a href="mailto:support@wealthfront.com">support@wealthfront.com</a> and providing us enough information to identify your account and prove that you are the owner of the identified account. We will endeavor to act on these deletion requests as soon as reasonably practicable. Deletions take effect when we act on them. Residual information related to your account may remain for some time on our servers. If you are a Client you may request that we remove your personal information, and we will do so as soon as reasonably practicable. However, we may retain such information, as well as any data related to your trades, in accordance with applicable laws. In no case will we share any individual trading data unless required by regulators or other government bodies.</li>
<li>You may decline to provide personal information to Wealthfront. Declining to provide personal information may disqualify you for Wealthfront services and Site features that require certain personal information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
