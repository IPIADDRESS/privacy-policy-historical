  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Policy Effective Date: Updated August 1, 2018</p>

  <h2>Your Privacy Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Wealthfront’s number one priority is your trust. Your privacy is essential to earning and
    keeping that trust. This tenet drives all of the decisions we make, as well as how we
    gather, use and store any information we acquire from you.
  </p>

  <p>
    We created this Privacy Policy to be as clear and direct as possible about how we
    gather and use your non-public personal information and other types of personal
    information (“Personal Information”). Want the details? Read on.
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Wealthfront Corporation (formerly known as Wealthfront Inc.) and its affiliates (“Wealthfront”,
    “we”, “us” and/or “our”) offer financial planning and portfolio management services through an
    automated investment adviser service (“Service”). Our Service is made available through Wealthfront’s
    website, <a href="/">www.wealthfront.com</a> (“Site”), or our related mobile
    application (“App”). This Privacy Policy describes how Wealthfront treats your Personal Information
    when you use or evaluate our Site, the App and/or Service or when you apply to and/or become an
    employee (“Employee”).
  </p>

  <p>
    For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, a User is an individual who uses our Site
    or App to understand or evaluate our Service; and a Client is an individual who
    signs our <a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/static/documents/client-agreements/WEALTHFRONT-BROKERAGE-TAXABLE-CLIENT-ACCOUNT-AGREEMENT.pdf">Client Agreement</a> that
    entitles the Client to have her or his investment portfolio managed by Wealthfront.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our Privacy Policy, <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Use</a> and, where applicable,
    <a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/static/documents/client-agreements/WEALTHFRONT-BROKERAGE-TAXABLE-CLIENT-ACCOUNT-AGREEMENT.pdf">Client Agreement</a>, collectively govern
    your use or evaluation of our Site, App and/or Service.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection</h2>
  <p>
    The type of information we collect depends on whether you are a current or former User, Client and/or
    Employee. We collect Personal Information from you when you voluntarily provide it to us. Examples of
    instances when we collect Personal Information include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      when you answer questions on the Site or in the App to determine what kind of portfolio we
      might recommend if you were to become a Client,
    </li>
    <li>
      when you register to open an account,
    </li>
    <li>
      when you contact our client service organization with questions,
    </li>
    <li>
      when you become a Client, or
    </li>
    <li>
      when you apply to become or become an Employee.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Wherever Wealthfront collects Personal Information, we endeavor to provide a link to
    this Privacy Policy and other relevant terms, such as our
    <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Use</a>.
  </p>

  <h4>Information We Collect from Users</h4>
  <p>
    We collect Personal Information such as name, address, telephone number and other information
    you may provide, such as your age, investable assets, and risk tolerance, which may include your
    financial goals and objectives, income information and other financial planning information about
    your household.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may collect your e-mail address and/or telephone number should you engage with us via our
    Site, App, or email or by calling our client service team.
  </p>

  <h4>Information We Collect from Clients</h4>
  <p>
    If you choose to become a Client, in addition to the information we collect from you as a User,
    described above, we will ask you for certain additional Personal Information, including but not
    limited to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      your and your beneficiaries’ full legal name, contact information, birth date, Social Security
      Number, citizenship;
    </li>
    <li>
      your investment objectives, approximate net worth, and other regulatory disclosures that may
      be necessary and required by federal and certain statutory laws (see our
      <a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/static/documents/client-agreements/WEALTHFRONT-BROKERAGE-TAXABLE-CLIENT-ACCOUNT-AGREEMENT.pdf">Client Agreement</a>);
    </li>
    <li>
      account numbers and login credentials for the accounts (bank or brokerage) you choose to link to
      our Service, any challenge and/or security questions associated with those accounts and any
      information contained in those accounts. Note: if you choose to link to our Service, we may
      use a third-party service to aggregate your account data.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Information We Collect when Acting As a Client’s Authorized Agent</h4>
  <p>
   Many of Wealthfront’s Clients choose to aggregate information from accounts at other financial
   institutions onto their dashboard on our Site or in our App; in enabling this functionality,
   Wealthfront acts as an agent to retrieve the Client account information maintained by such third-party
   financial institutions with which the Client has a legally-binding customer relationship
   (“Account Information”). This Account Information may include account balances, transactions and
   holdings from the linked financial institutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    By choosing to use our Service to aggregate and analyze Account Information, you expressly authorize
    and direct Wealthfront, on your behalf, to electronically retrieve Account Information. Wealthfront
    may work with one or more third-party financial service providers to access and retrieve your
    Account Information.
  </p>

  <h4>Information We Collect from Employees</h4>
  <p>
    Wealthfront collects Personal Information from current, prospective and former Employees, their designated
    contact in case of a medical emergency, and beneficiaries under any insurance policy (“Employee Personal Information”).
    The Employee Personal Information we collect may include title, name, address, phone number, email address,
    date of birth, passport number, driver’s license number, social security number, financial information related
    to credit checks, bank details for payroll, external brokerage account information, holdings and trading
    activity, information that may be recorded on a CV, resume or other employment application form, contact
    information in case of an emergency, and beneficiaries under any insurance policy. Additionally, we may
    collect sensitive Employee Personal Information, such as details of health and disability, including
    mental health, medical leave, and parental leave.
  </p>

  <h4>Information We Collect via the Referral Program</h4>
  <p>
    Wealthfront manages a referral program called “The Wealthfront Invite Program.” The program allows our
    Clients to lower their annual advisory fee in exchange for referring a person who ultimately become a
    client. Participation in our referral program is free and voluntary for our Clients. By participating,
    you may provide us with certain information about the person to whom you refer our service, such as name
    and e-mail address. We treat this information like all our other Personal Information.
  </p>

  <h4>Information Regarding Children</h4>
  <p>
    Due to the nature of our business, Services and benefits are not marketed to minors. Except for beneficiary
    information as described above, Wealthfront does not knowingly solicit Personal Information from children under
    the age of 18.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information to Wealthfront.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we learn that we have collected Personal Information directly from a minor, we will delete such information
    from our files.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child under the age of 18 has directly provided us with
    Personal Information without his or her consent, he or she should contact us at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:support@wealthfront.com" class="">support@wealthfront.com</a> and
    we will delete such information from our files.
  </p>

  <h4>Other Ways We Collect Information</h4>
  <p>
    Other means by which we collect Personal Information include the following:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Anonymized or aggregated Information.</strong> Wealthfront’s Site and App automatically record certain
      anonymized or aggregated information about your use or evaluation of our Service. Anonymized or aggregated
      information is used for a variety of functions, including the measurement of Users’ interest in and use of
      various portions or features of the Site and App. Anonymized or aggregated information is not Personal Information, and
      we may use such information in a number of ways, including internal analysis, analytics and research. We may share
      this information with third parties for our purposes in an anonymized or aggregated form that is designed to prevent
      anyone from identifying you.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Cookies and Pixels.</strong> Similar to other technology platforms and services, Wealthfront uses cookies,
      a small piece of computer code that enables our Web servers to “identify” Users, each time an individual initiates
      a session on our Site. A cookie is set in order to identify you and tailor the Site to you. Cookies do not store
      any of the Personal Information that you provided to us; they are simply identifiers. You may delete cookie files
      from your own hard drive at any time. However, cookies may be necessary to provide access to much of the content
      and many of the features of the Site.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Pixel Tags.</strong> Along with cookies, we may use “pixel tags,” also known as “web beacons,” which are
      small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our Sites. A pixel tag can collect information such as the
      Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL of the
      page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser
      that fetched the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Site and App Activity.</strong> Wealthfront may also use third-party tracking technology, such as Google
      Analytics, to record similar information regarding you and your activity on our Site and App.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>“Do Not Track” Technology.</strong> We do not collect Personal Information about your online activities
      over time and across different web sites or online services. Therefore, our Site does not respond to Do Not Track
      (“DNT”) signals. We do not knowingly authorize third-parties to collect Personal Information about your online
      activities over time and across different web sites or online services.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>How we use Information</h3>

  <h4>User Personal Information </h4>
  <p>
    We use your Personal Information to help you evaluate our Service, offer you new products or services, and enhance
    our Service. We may also use your personal information a number of ways, including research, internal analysis, and
    analytics.
  </p>

  <h4>Client Personal Information</h4>
  <p>
    Wealthfront stores, processes, and maintains Personal Information related to you in order to provide client support,
    offer new products or services and provide our Service to Clients in accordance with the rules of regulatory bodies
    such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”).
    As a User, you may choose not to provide such information to us, but if you choose not to provide such information,
    you will not be able to become a Client.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, we may share the information required to become a Client with our brokerage partner(s) solely to allow
    our brokerage partner(s) to provide services to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a Client is also a User, the provisions hereunder related to Users will apply to such Personal Information in
    those circumstances.
  </p>


  <h4>Mobile Computing</h4>
  <p>
    Wealthfront provides websites and online resources that are specifically designed to be compatible for use with mobile
    computing devices. Mobile versions of our website are governed by the provisions hereunder related to the Site and may
    require that you log in with an account. In such cases, information about the use of each mobile version of the website
    may be associated with your accounts. In addition, we may enable individuals to download tools, such as an application,
    widget or other tool, that can be used on mobile or other computing devices. Some of these tools may store information
    on mobile or other devices. These tools may transmit Personal Information to Wealthfront to enable you to access
    your account information and to enable us to track the use of these tools. Some of these tools may enable users to
    e-mail reports and other information from the tool. We may use Personal Information or non-identifiable information
    transmitted to us to enhance these tools, to develop new tools, for quality improvement and as otherwise described
    in this Privacy Policy or in other notices we provide.
  </p>

  <p>
    If an Employee is also a User or a Client, the provisions hereunder related to Users and Clients will apply to
    such Personal Information in those circumstances.
  </p>

  <h4>Information Sharing and Onward Transfer</h4>
  <p>
    We will not sell, rent, or trade your Personal Information (whether you are a current or former User, Client
    and/or Employee) to any nonaffiliated third-parties except as required by law, such as when we reasonably believe
    it is necessary or appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,
    front running or scalping, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations
    of our <a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/legal/terms">Terms of Use</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Wealthfront may share your Personal Information among affiliated Wealthfront entities in connetion with the provision
    of Services to Clients and Users. There are certain circumstances, in which we may share your Personal Information
    with nonaffiliated third-parties without further disclosure to you. For example, from time-to-time, we hire
    third-parties to perform certain business and technology related functions (e.g., mailing information, database
    maintenance and payment processing). In the case we hire a third party to perform a function of this kind, we
    endeavor to only provide them with the minimum information they need to perform their specific function and to
    require these third parties to safeguard your information.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3>Your Choices and Opting Out</h3>
  <p>
    You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information, as set out in this
    Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may decline to provide Personal Information to Wealthfront. Declining to provide personal information may
    disqualify you from using Wealthfront Services, Site, and App features that require certain Personal Information.
  </p>

  <h4>Opting-Out - Obtaining and Withdrawing Consent</h4>
  <p>
    Where you have consented to Wealthfront’s use of your Personal Information, you may withdraw that consent at any time
    and opt out by contacting us by email, phone or physical mail via the contacts indicated under the “Questions
    and Contacting Us” section below. Additionally, before we use Personal Information for any new purpose not
    originally authorized by you, we will provide information regarding the new purpose and give you the opportunity
    to opt out.
  </p>

  <p>
    Prior to disclosing sensitive Personal Information to a third-party or processing sensitive Personal Information
    for a purpose other than its original purpose, the purposes set forth under this Privacy Policy or the purpose
    authorized subsequently by you, we will endeavor to obtain your explicit consent (opt-in). Where your consent
    for the processing of Personal Information is otherwise required by law or contract, we will comply with the
    law or contract.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will use Employee Personal Information only for employment-related purposes. If we intend to use this
    Employee Personal Information for any other purpose, we will provide the Employee with an opportunity to
    opt-out of such use.
  </p>

  <h4>Restricting Communications</h4>
  <p>
    Wealthfront may use your Personal Information to communicate with you regarding our Service or to tell you about blog
    posts or Services that we believe will be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to
    receive communications from us, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in the communications or
    contact us at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:support@wealthfront.com" class="">support@wealthfront.com</a>. Please note that you cannot opt-out of administrative communications such
    as regulatory, billing or service notifications.
  </p>

  <h3>Accessing Your Personal Information</h3>
  <p>
    Users or Clients may contact us at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:support@wealthfront.com" class="">support@wealthfront.com</a> to request information about how to access your Personal
    Information.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Wealthfront provides all Clients with continuous access via the Site to prompt reporting information about
      account status, securities positions and balances.
    </li>
    <li>
      Clients can access or amend their Personal Information at any time by signing in to your Wealthfront account
      via our Site or App.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your requests will be processed in line with local laws, including without undue delay and in accordance
      with any required time frames. Although Wealthfront makes good faith efforts to provide individuals with
      access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide access,
      including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’
      privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate
      to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary.
      If we determine that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will endeavor to provide
      you with an explanation of why that determination has been made within one month of the request, a contact
      point for any further inquiries and any other legally required information. To protect your privacy, we
      will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making any
      changes to your Personal Information.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Retention and Deletion </h4>
  <p>
    Wealthfront retains the Personal Information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as
    you use our Site, App, or Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, to
    provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business
    purposes, enforce our agreements, or as otherwise required to comply with contracts and comply with all
    applicable laws.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may request deletion of Personal Information by contacting us at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:support@wealthfront.com" class="">support@wealthfront.com</a> and providing us enough
    information to identify your account and prove that you are the owner of the identified account. However, we may
    retain residual information related to your account, as well as any data related to your trades, in accordance
    with applicable laws. In no case will we share any individual trading data unless required by regulators or
    other government bodies, or in accordance with applicable laws.
  </p>

    Wealthfront takes reasonable steps, endeavoring to use appropriate technical or organizational measures, to protect your
    Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.
    However, no Internet, email, or electronic operating system that enables the transmission of data is ever fully secure or
    error free therefore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
