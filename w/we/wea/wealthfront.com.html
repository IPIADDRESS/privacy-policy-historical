  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Policy Effective Date: May 9, 2015</p>

  <h2>Your Privacy Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Wealthfront’s number one priority is your trust. Your privacy is essential to
    earning and keeping that trust. This tenet drives all of the decisions we make,
    as well as how we gather, use and store any information we acquire from you.
  </p>

  <p>
    We created this Privacy Policy to be as clear and direct as possible about how we
    gather and use your information. To ensure your privacy we store your personal data
    (“Personal Data”) on our own servers (i.e. not cloud-based hosting services). We avoid
    wherever possible using third-party cloud-based tools that require us to share your
    Personal Data to use them. We will <strong>never</strong> rent, sell or trade your
    personal information to anyone. Ever.
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Wealthfront Inc. (“Wealthfront”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”) operates an automated
    investment service (“Service”). Our Service is made available through our
    <a href="/">website</a> and via applications that reside on
    mobile devices. This Privacy Policy describes how Wealthfront treats your Personal
    Data when you use or evaluate our service.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the purpose of this agreement a User is an individual who uses our website
    or mobile application to evaluate our service, or for educational purposes and
    a Client is an individual who signs our
    <a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/static/documents/client-agreements/WEALTHFRONT-CLIENT-ACCOUNT-AGREEMENT.pdf">Client Agreement</a> that entitles
    the Client to have her or his investment portfolio managed by Wealthfront. Our
    Privacy Policy, <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Use</a> and where applicable
    <a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/static/documents/client-agreements/WEALTHFRONT-CLIENT-ACCOUNT-AGREEMENT.pdf">Client Agreement</a> collectively
    govern your use or evaluation of our service.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection</h2>
  <p>
    The types of information we collect depend on whether you are a User or Client.
    We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide information to us.
    Examples of instances when we collect Personal Data include when you answer questions
    on our website or in our mobile application(s) to determine what kind of portfolio we
    might recommend if you were to become a Client, when you register to open an account,
    when you contact our client service organization with questions or when you become a
    Client. Wherever Wealthfront collects Personal Data, we make an effort to link to this
    Privacy Policy and other relevant terms, such as our
    <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Use</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>In General</h3>
  <p>
    Wealthfront’s servers automatically record certain information (“Non-Identifiable”
    or “Aggregated Data”) about your use or evaluation of our Service. Similar to other
    technology platforms and services, Wealthfront records information such as browsing
    activity, data displayed or clicked on (such as UI elements, ads, and links), and other
    information (such as browser type, IP address, date and time of access, cookie ID, and
    referrer URL). Along with cookies, Wealthfront may also use third-party tracking technology,
    such as Google Analytics, to record similar information regarding you and your activity
    on the Site.
  </p>

  <h3>Information Collection from Users</h3>
  <p>
    We collect personal information such as name, address, telephone number
    and other optional information you may provide, such as your age, investable
    assets, and risk tolerance, which may include your financial goals and objectives,
    income information and other financial planning information about your household.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may collect your e-mail address and/or telephone number should you opt to engage
    via our website, mobile app, email or dedicated telephone number with our client
    service team.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also collect account numbers and login credentials for the accounts (bank or
    brokerage) you choose to link to our Service, any challenge and/or security questions
    associated with those accounts and any information contained in those accounts.
  </p>

  <h3>Information Collection from Clients</h3>
  <p>
    If you choose to become a Client, in addition to the information we collect from
    you as a User, as described above, we will ask you for certain information, including,
    but not limited to, your full legal name, contact information, birth date, Social
    Security Number, citizenship, investment objectives, approximate net worth, and other
    regulatory disclosures that may be necessary and required under Federal and certain
    statutory law (see our <a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/static/documents/client-agreements/WEALTHFRONT-CLIENT-ACCOUNT-AGREEMENT.pdf">Client Agreement</a>).
  </p>

  <h3>Acting As Your Authorized Agent</h3>
  <p>
    Wealthfront offers services, like the Portfolio Review, where Wealthfront acts as
    an agent to retrieve your financial account information, such as your account balances,
    transactions and holdings, from financial institutions you designate. Portfolio Review
    is an optional Service you may utilize by providing financial account credentials, allowing
    us to securely connect with third-party financial institutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    By accessing and using the Wealthfront services, including but not limited to, Portfolio
    Review Service, you expressly authorize and direct Wealthfront, on your behalf, to
    electronically retrieve your account information maintained by third-party financial
    institutions with which you have a legally binding customer relationship (“Account
    Information”). Wealthfront may work with one or more third-party financial service
    technology providers to access and retrieve your Account Information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wealthfront is not responsible for and cannot guarantee the accuracy or timeliness of
    Account Information we retrieve on your behalf directly, from third-party technology
    providers, from third-party financial institutions where your accounts are held, or
    from third-party market data providers used to provide the Services.
  </p>

  <h2>Use of Information</h2>
  <p>
    Wealthfront stores, processes, and maintains data related to you in order to provide
    client support, offer new products or services and provide our Service to Clients in
    accordance with the rules of regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange
    Commission and FINRA. You may choose not to provide such information to us, but if
    you choose not to provide such information, you will not be able to become a Client.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may share the information required to become a Client with our brokerage partner
    solely for the purpose of allowing our brokerage partner to provide services to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wealthfront may use your Personal Data to communicate with you regarding our Service
    or to tell you about blog posts or services that we believe will be of interest to you.
    If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive <i>marketing communications</i>
    from us, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in the communications.
    Please note that you cannot opt-out of administrative communications such as regulatory,
    billing or service notifications.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Sharing and Onward Transfer</h2>
  <p>
    We will not sell, rent, or trade your Personal Data with any third parties
    except as required by law, such as when we reasonably believe it is necessary
    or appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,
    suspected fraud, front running or scalping, situations involving potential threats
    to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our
    <a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/legal/terms">Terms of Use</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are certain circumstances, outlined below, in which we may share your Personal
    Data without further disclosure to you. From time-to-time, we hire other companies to
    perform certain business and technology related functions (e.g. mailing information,
    database maintenance and payment processing). In the case we hire another company to
    perform a function of this kind, we only provide them with the minimum information
    they need to perform their specific function. Wealthfront maintains strict physical,
    electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your
    Non-Public personal information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Except as required by law or requested by regulatory authorities, Wealthfront agrees
    to maintain your non-public Personal Data in strict confidence.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices and Obligations</h2>
  <p>
    You may request deletion of personal information by emailing <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:support@wealthfront.com" class="">support@wealthfront.com</a>
    and providing us enough information to identify your account and prove that you are the
    owner of the identified account. We will endeavor to make any deletion request effective
    as soon as reasonably practicable. However, we may retain residual information related
    to your account, as well as any data related to your trades, in accordance with applicable
    laws. In no case will we share any individual trading data unless required by regulators
    or other government bodies.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may decline to provide personal information to Wealthfront. Declining to provide
    personal information may disqualify you for Wealthfront services and Site features
    that require certain personal information.
  </p>

  <h2>Other Important Information</h2>
  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>
    Wealthfront takes reasonable steps to protect your Personal Data from loss, misuse,
    and unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. No Internet, email,
    or electronic operating system that enables the transmission of data is ever fully
    secure or error free so, please take special care in deciding what information you
    send to us in this manner.
  </p>

  <h3>Advertising</h3>
  <p>
    We do not allow third-party advertising on our Website or Mobile applications.

  <h3>Referral Program</h3>
  <p>
    Wealthfront manages a referral program called “The Wealthfront Invite Program.”
    The program allows our clients to lower their annual advisory fee in exchange
    for referring other users who ultimately become a client. Participation in our
    referral program is free and voluntary for our clients. By participating, you
    may provide us with certain information about the person to whom you refer our
    service, such as name and e-mail address. We treat this information like all
    our other Personal Data.
