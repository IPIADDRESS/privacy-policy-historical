Demographic information is divided into two categories: 1)    "non-public information", which consists of purchase history    information and one-on-one communications between you and other users of the    Service; and 2) "public information", which consists of all other    demographic information. We ask that you do not enter personal information or    financial information into your Profile (for example, dont use your address    or passcode as your username, or include your name or address in your written    responses), because if you do then it may be posted publicly on the Service,    and the information will then be treated as "demographic    information" that is "public information." Please note that    nowhere on the Service do we knowingly collect personal information from    children under the age of 18, as we require that all users represent to us    that they are at least 18 years old. </p></td>

Those third parties may use your    personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will    need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your    preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Additionally,    you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so submitted to    such third parties in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and    disclose any other information you submit to us. </p>

These pages are known    as "Co-Branded Pages" and these companies are known as Co-Branded    Companies. If the page on which you submit information is a Co-Branded Page,    or was accessed by clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, then we may share    your personal information with the associated Co-Branded Company. Co-Branded    Companies may use your personal information in accordance with their own    privacy policies. You will need to contact Co-Branded Companies to instruct    them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal    information by them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all    such information so submitted to such Co-Branded Companies in the same manner    in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit    to us.

      How We    Use Public Information and Other Demographic Information</strong></p>
          <p>We may review all demographic information.    We may use public information to enable other users to find your profile, to    determine whether they are a match for you and to communicate with you. We    may use demographic information to tailor the Service and communications to    your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on    an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers your    identity). One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood    that our advertisers goods and services will appeal to Wealthymen.coms users,    so that we may target specific ads at specific demographic groups. Our    sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., we do    not tell advertisers which particular Wealthymen.com users are members of which    demographic groups), subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When you    respond to an advertisement, however, we ask you to remember that if that ad    that is targeted to a demographic group and you decide to give the advertiser    your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify you as    being a member of that demographic group. Please also be aware that when we    disclose your financial information or personal information to a Co-Branded    Company, as described above, we may also disclose to that Co-Branded Company    your demographic information, other than the content of one-on-one    communications between you and other members. Please also be aware that we    may disclose your demographic information on a non-anonymous basis as    described above in the paragraph titled "Special Cases in which we Share    Personal and Financial Information." Also, to read further details about    how we may use your public information, see our <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="/terms.php">Terms    of Use</a>.</p></td>

Please note that we will    continue to have the right to change our privacy policy and practices, and    how we use your personally identifiable information, without notice, as    described in the first paragraph of this Privacy Policy, provided that such    changes shall only apply to information gathered on or after the date of the    change. </p></td>
