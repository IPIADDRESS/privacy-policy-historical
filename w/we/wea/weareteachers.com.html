                    <p>
                    	Once you are a member of WeAreTeachers, you are able to post User Content on the Site, including to create a profile containing basic information about yourself (your name, e-mail address, and other contact information) as well as more detailed profile containing professional and personal data about you. This may include past jobs, areas of expertise, and individual âclaims to fame.â You can post photos, too! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	Once submitted, User Content will be made available to other users of the Site. You may access, correct, update, and delete the information in your User Content at any time by logging into the Site using your login ID and password, and choosing âEdit My Profile.â  User Content will remain available to other users until you request that it be removed from our active database. To do so, contact WeAreTeachers via email at <a href="mailto:support@weareteachers.com">support@weareteachers.com</a> or cancel your WeAreTeachers membership in which case the Content will be made unavailable through the Service. WeAreTeachers will try to execute changes to the User Content available on the Site promptly â typically within two business days.

                    <p>
                    	Your first and last names are displayed throughout the Site and are therefore available to the public. Other people can see User Content you make available, the services you offer, your online journal, feedback that is posted, ratings and associated comments, and so on in addition to your profile. Therefore, if you include your registration information â or any other personal information â in User Content that you post to the Site or sell using the Service, that information may be widely available to other users since WeAreTeachers does not delete or redact registration or other information from Content you provide.  WeAreTeachers does not control that disclosure, and is not liable in any way for anyone's use or misuse of the information in the disclosure.  So be careful about the information you choose to disclose â if you do not want your personal information to be displayed as part of your User Content, donât include it in the Content! In other words, use caution and judgment here. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	And remember: you may not include personal information about other people in User Content. You also may not use personal information about other users of WeAreTeachers in a way that is inconsistent with WeAreTeachersâ Privacy Policy.  If you do, you will have violated the terms of this Agreement, and WeAreTeachers may terminate your membership. WeAreTeachers is not liable for any damage that may be incurred due to use of registration or other personal information that was made available as part of User Content.

This may include the name, address, and phone number where you would like to receive your payment.

WeAreTeachers is not involved in the actual transaction between Learner and Teacher (or other vendor).  For payment processing purposes, only PayPal is accepted. Therefore, any disclosure of your PayPal username is strictly to facilitate the purchase of User Content, services, and other products.

WeAreTeachers uses server log data to analyze trends, administer the Service and the Site, and improve service levels.
