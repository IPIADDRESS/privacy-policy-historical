<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p>WeAreTeachers has established this Privacy Policy to explain how we  collect personal information about you, and how this information is used  by us. Any capitalized terms used and not defined in this Privacy  Policy are defined in the WeAreTeachers <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of  Use</a>.</p>
<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time without prior  notice. We will do our best to keep you abreast of these changes by  posting a notice regarding the new Privacy Policy as well as the new  Privacy Policy itself on the Site. You should visit this page  periodically to review the Privacy Policy because it is binding on you.</p>
<p>We take protecting your personal information very seriously. That  being said, we would ask you to be careful and use caution when  providing personal information, including in User Content which you post  to or otherwise transmit using the Site or when you communicate with  Teachers, Learners, and other users. Unfortunately, there is no way we  can be responsible for their actions.</p>
<p>By using, accessing or registering on the Site, you agree (a) to  comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, and (b)  that WeAreTeachers and any Teacher, Learner, or other user may process  (i.e., use, collect, etc.) your personal information as described in  this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service. Personal information may be  processed by WeAreTeachers or the Teacher, Learner, or other user in  the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including  the United States) where laws regarding processing of personal  information may be less stringent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Children under Age 13 </strong></h3>
<p>WeAreTeachers does not knowingly collect or solicit personal  information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such  persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to  register for WeAreTeachers or send any information about yourself to us,  including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No  one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on  WeAreTeachers or use the Site in any way. In the event that we learn  that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13  without verification of parental consent, we will delete that  information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have  any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at

<h3>Children between the Ages of 13 and 18</h3>

<h3><strong>Collection and Use of Information from Subscribers</strong></h3>

This information is  stored on WeAreTeachers' secure servers and is not shared with any  outside parties except as described in this Privacy Policy. If you  forget your password, follow the process set up by WeAreTeachers and a  new password will be sent to you.</p>
<p>We may also use your registration information</p>
<ul>
<li>â€¢to verify access rights to the Service;</li>
<li>â€¢in connection with transactions facilitated through the Site,  including to purchase and sell User Content and services;</li>
<li>â€¢to provide you with personalized content programming,  instructions and services;</li>
<li>â€¢to provide you with information, through the Site or via e-mail,  about our (and our affiliates) products and services as well as news,  events, and promotions;</li>
<li>â€¢to send you administrative messages and email updates regarding  your membership (including fees owed or earned);</li>
<li>â€¢for assessment of service levels;</li>
<li>â€¢to better understand on an aggregated basis how our (and our  affiliates) products are used, gauge traffic patterns and determine what  types of content and services are most popular with users of our  products and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may opt out of receiving administrative messages, email updates,  and other notices by canceling your WeAreTeachers membership.</p>
<p>We also collect credit card and billing information to complete the  registration. WeAreTeachers stores this information for the length of  the billing period since subscription fees are recurring on an annual  basis until your subscription is terminated. Such credit card  information is removed and destroyed once a subscription has been  terminated.</p>
<p>To protect your WeAreTeachers login ID, please keep your password  secure.</p>
<h3>Posting User Content on the Site</h3>
<p>Once you are a member of WeAreTeachers, you are able to post User  Content on the Site, including to create a profile containing basic  information about yourself (your name, e-mail address, and other contact  information) as well as more detailed profile containing professional  and personal data about you. This may include past jobs, areas of  expertise, and individual "claims to fame". You can post photos, too!</p>
<p>Once submitted, User Content will be made available to other users of  the Site. You may access, correct, update, and delete the information  in your User Content at any time by logging into the Site using your  login ID and password, and choosing Edit My Profile. User Content will  remain available to other users until you request that it be removed  from our active database. To do so, contact WeAreTeachers via email at

 </script></span> or cancel your WeAreTeachers membership in which case the Content will  be made unavailable through the Service. WeAreTeachers will try to  execute changes to the User Content available on the Site promptly  typically within two business days.</p>
<h3>Sharing User Content</h3>
<p>Your first and last names are displayed throughout the Site and are  therefore available to the public. Other people can see User Content you  make available, the services you offer, your online journal, feedback  that is posted, ratings and associated comments, and so on in addition  to your profile. Therefore, if you include your registration information  or any other personal information in User Content that you post to the  Site or sell using the Service, that information may be widely available  to other users since WeAreTeachers does not delete or redact  registration or other information from Content you provide.  WeAreTeachers does not control that disclosure, and is not liable in any  way for anyone's use or misuse of the information in the disclosure. So  be careful about the information you choose to discloseÂ“ if you do not  want your personal information to be displayed as part of your User  Content, don't include it in the Content! In other words, use caution  and judgment here.</p>
<p>And remember: you may not include personal information about other  people in User Content. You also may not use personal information about  other users of WeAreTeachers in a way that is inconsistent with  WeAreTeachers' Privacy Policy. If you do, you will have violated the  terms of this Agreement, and WeAreTeachers may terminate your  membership. WeAreTeachers is not liable for any damage that may be  incurred due to use of registration or other personal information that  was made available as part of User Content.</p>
<h3>Receiving Payments for Recommendations</h3>
<p>In order to receive payments from recommendations that result in a  transaction, as more fully described in our Supplemental Terms and  Conditions, you will have to provide additional information when you  register. This may include the name, address, and phone number where you  would like to receive your payment. Since payment will be made via  PayPal, we will ask for your PayPal username in order to process your  payment.</p>
<p>Your earnings from making recommendations are subject to US tax laws.  Therefore, in order to receive payment, you will have to complete the  Taxpayer Information section. We ask for your SSN, TIN, or EIN for the  sole purpose of issuing a 1099 form for your earnings.</p>
<h3>Receiving Payments from Learners</h3>
<p>The purchase of User Content, a service or other products from a  Teacher or a third party vendor is strictly between the Learner who is  purchasing the Content, product or service and the Teacher or other  vendor selling it. WeAreTeachers is not involved in the actual  transaction between Learner and Teacher (or other vendor). For payment  processing purposes, only PayPal is accepted. Therefore, any disclosure  of your PayPal username is strictly to facilitate the purchase of User  Content, services, and other products. Visit <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">https://www.paypal.com/</a> to learn more  about PayPal.</p>
<h3>Cookies and Passive Data Collection</h3>
<p>In order to improve the Service and the Site, we use cookies when  you are logged into the Site using your login ID and password. A cookie  is a piece of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server  and can only be understood by the server that gave it to you. It  functions as your computer's identification token and enables  WeAreTeachers to personalize your experience when you are using the Site  or Service. If you reject the cookie, you may not be able to use  certain features of the Site.</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your  browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance  to decide whether to accept it. (For some Web pages that require an  authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept  cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.)</p>
<p>While WeAreTeachers uses cookies to enable you to use the Services  and the Site, like most Internet services, we use log files, both on the  client and server side. The data held in log files includes the  Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, browser type,  e-mail application, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit  Web pages, computer platform type, date/time stamp, and user activity.  WeAreTeachers uses server log data to analyze trends, administer the  Service and the Site, and improve service levels. IP addresses may be  disclosed to a third party if we believe in good faith that the law or  legal process requires it, or to protect the rights or property of  WeAreTeachers, our users or the general public.</p>
<h3>Third Party Websites</h3>
<p>Users should be aware that other websites visited before entering  WeAreTeachers might place personally identifiable information within a  User's URL during a visit to their website, and WeAreTeachers has no  control over such websites. Accordingly, some of this information may be  logged by a subsequent website that collects URL information.</p>
<h3><strong>Disclosures of Information to Third Parties</strong></h3>
<p>WeAreTeachers may need to provide your registration and other  personal information to third parties as described in this section.</p>
<h3>. . . to Service Providers</h3>
<p>WeAreTeachers may need to provide your registration and other  personal information to third parties to deliver specific services to  you (such as hosting services, support services, or credit card payment  processing).</p>
<h3>. . . to Law Enforcement</h3>
<p>WeAreTeachers may disclose registration and any other personal  information if required by a subpoena or other judicial or  administrative order, where required by law, or, at our sole discretion,  where we deem necessary to protect the safety of any individual or the  general public or to prevent violation of our Terms of Service or the  rights of WeAreTeachers or any third party.</p>
<h3>. . . to Affiliates</h3>
<p>Although WeAreTeachers currently does not have a parent company, any  subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control  (collectively, affiliates), it may in the future. WeAreTeachers may  share some of all of your personal information with these affiliates, in  which case we will seek to require our affiliates to honor this Privacy  Policy.</p>
<h3>. . . in the Event of a Change in Ownership</h3>
<p>In the event of a change in ownership, or a merger with, acquisition  by, or sale of assets to, another entity, we reserve the right to  transfer all of WeAreTeachers's registration information and User  Content, including email addresses, to a separate entity. WeAreTeachers  will notify users via a posting on this site or email (in  WeAreTeachers's discretion) of such a transfer, and users may choose to  modify their registration information at that time. This means if you  are concerned about your personal information migrating to a new owner,  you can deactivate your account.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>WeAreTeachers uses industry standard security measures (Secure Socket  Layer (SSL)) to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the  information under our control. Although we make good faith efforts to  store the information collected by WeAreTeachers in a secure operating  environment that is not available to the public, WeAreTeachers cannot  guarantee complete security. Further, while we work hard to ensure the  integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee  that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from  illegally obtaining this information.</p>
<h3>Updating or Removing User Information</h3>
<p>Users may, at any time, choose to correct or update the information  they have submitted to WeAreTeachers, by going to their account. Even if  you update or remove your information, however, it may be retained in  our backup files and archives.</p>
<p>Members may remove their user information from WeAreTeachers by  canceling their membership.</p>
<h3>Changes to the WeAreTeachers Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>If we change the Privacy Policy, we will post the new Privacy Policy  on the Site with a link from the Site's homepage, so that you are always  able to determine what information we collect, how we use it, and under  what circumstances if any we disclose it.</p>
<h3>Contacting Us</h3>
<p>If you have any questions or suggestions regarding the Privacy  Policy, please contact WeAreTeachers.com, L.L.C. at our Austin  headquarters located at 8015 Shoal Creek Blvd., Suite 100, Austin, TX  78757.</p>
