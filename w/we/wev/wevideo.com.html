		<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy effective immediately following posting of the modified version on the Site.&nbsp; Your use of our Services following posting will constitute your acceptance of the modified version. &nbsp;<b>IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.</b></p>
		<h2><b>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND STORE</b></h2>
		<p>WeVideo may collect and store the following information when running our Services.</p>
		<h2>Information You Provide</h2>
		<p>Depending on how you use the Services, you may be required to provide certain personally identifiable information (“<i><b>Personal Information</b></i>”), which may include, but is not limited to, your:</p>
		<div style="padding-bottom:10px;"><ul><li>Name</li><li>Email address</li><li>Mailing address</li><li>Username for social media accounts you wish to connect to your account</li><li>Your image and likeness if you include it in any media content that you upload or include in videos that you create with our Services (these type of files are referred to as your “<i><b>User Content</b></i>”)</li></ul></div>
		<p>You may choose not to provide your Personal Information; however, if you do not provide your Personal Information you may not be able to use all the functions offered by the Services.</p>
		<p>Our Services offer publicly accessible community services such as blogs, forums, and public video pages. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas might be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Your posts may remain even after you cancel your account. For questions about your Personal Information on our Services, please contact info@wevideo.com.</p>
		<h2>Refer a Friend</h2>
		<p>When you invite others to join WeVideo or share your User Content via email, you will need to provide us with email addresses for each person that you wish to send your User Content or &nbsp;an invite to.</p>
		<h2>Usage Data</h2>
		<p>In addition, when you use our Services, the following types of information may all be logged automatically (“<i><b>Usage Information</b></i>”):</p>
		<div style="padding-bottom:10px;"><ul><li>Your Device’s Internet Protocol (“<i><b>IP</b></i>”) address,</li><li>Type of mobile device you use,</li><li>Operating system of your mobile device,</li><li>Browser type,</li><li>Non-precise geographic location (e.g. zip code and city)</li><li>Technical information about your device, system and App software, and peripherals</li><li>date and time stamps associated with transactions,</li><li>system configuration information, &nbsp;and</li><li>metadata concerning your User Content, and other interactions with our Services.</li></ul></div>
		<h2>Cookies and Web beacons</h2>
		<p>WeVideo also uses “cookies” to collect information and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to our Services. We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of our Services, to better understand how you interact with our Services and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of our Services.</p>
		<p>We also use Web beacons, also called web bugs to collect information and improve our Services. A Web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site or in an email.</p>
		<p>We do not use cookies or Web beacons to collect Personal Information nor do we collect precise geographic location.&nbsp; However, some Devices automatically log location information in photos and videos recorded by that Device. If you upload any User Content from a Device that does so, .you agree that we may use this information to optimize your experience. If you do not wish to share User Content embedded with your geo-location information with us, please do not upload them. If you don’t want to store location data in your User Content, please consult the documentation for your Device to turn off that feature.</p>
		<h2>Analytics</h2>
		<p>WeVideo also collects some information (ourselves or using third party services) using logging and cookies, such as IP address, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information. We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of our Services, for the Service’s technical administration, to increase our Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for our Services to process their requests. As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics. <a class="contentLink" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/" target="_blank">The Privacy Policy of Google Analytics</a> are available online, <a class="contentLink" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">and information on how to opt out of that service</a>.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h2><b>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</b></h2>
		<p>We use your information:</p>
		<div style="padding-bottom:10px;"><ul><li>to provide and improve our Services,</li><li>to administer your use of our Services,</li><li>to better understand your needs and interests,</li><li>to personalize and improve your experience, and</li><li>to provide or offer software updates and product announcements.</li><li>to enhance current and develop new products and services</li></ul></div>
		<p>If you submit Personal Information to us, we will only use it for the purpose you requested or for which it is collected or for any purpose you subsequently authorize.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>You grant WeVideo an irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free right and license to use the anonymous information we collect in any way.</p>
		<p>WeVideo does not access your contact information or address book within your mobile device.&nbsp; Nor does WeVideo have any access to any of the personal information or credit card information that you have provided to Apple or Google to register for their services.</p>
		<h2><b>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FOR PAYMENT INFORMATION</b></h2>
		<p>If you provide credit card or debit card information to complete a purchase, it is our policy to use third-party payment processing systems that comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), which is an industry wide security standard designed to protect the confidentiality and security of your credit card information, by encryption using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and storage with AES-256 encryption.&nbsp; Currently, we use Zuora, Inc., but we reserve the right to change this service provider at any time for any reason. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry standards.&nbsp; Your credit card information will also be subject to our payment processor’s privacy policy in addition to ours. <b>PLEASE READ THE PRIVACY POLICY ON THE WEBSITE OF ANY PAYMENT PROCESSOR THAT YOU ARE DIRECTED TO REGARDING THE USE, STORAGE AND PROTECTION OF YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION BEFORE SUBMITTING ANY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION.</b></p>
		<p>All information that you provide to us or our third party payment processor must be accurate, current and complete.&nbsp; In the event of a dispute, we may issue you with a provisional credit to your card until the dispute is resolved.&nbsp; If we issue a provisional credit and the dispute is resolved and the charges were correct, we shall recharge your debit or credit card to reverse this provisional credit. You expressly consent to this reversal if you falsely or incorrectly dispute a charge.&nbsp; If you wish to dispute a charge by mail or telephone please contact us at info@wevideo.com.&nbsp; If we elect at any time to charge any convenience fee for making a payment via a debit card, credit card, or electronic check, these fees will be stated at the time of payment before you finalize your charge.&nbsp; In the event of an unauthorized charge using a debit card or electronic check, please consult your bank’s rules regarding refunds and reversals.&nbsp; WeVideo complies with all legal requirements of your State’s applicable laws regarding providing refunds for unauthorized charges.&nbsp; When you make a charge, we shall display a completed charge screen.&nbsp; This is your electronic receipt.&nbsp; You should print or save this electronic receipt for your records.&nbsp; YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT CARDS, DEBIT CARDS OR OTHER PAYMENT MEANS USED TO INITIATE ANY TRANSACTION.</p>

We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.</p>
		<p>WeVideo will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on our Services according to the preferences you set in your account.
