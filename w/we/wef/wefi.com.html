<h3>INFORMATION COLLECTED VIA TECHNOLOGY</h3>
<p>We may collect general, aggregated, demographic, and non-personal information from our online visitors and users. The non-personal information will not be linked to any Personal Information of our online visitors or users, through cookies or other means, without consent. This type of anonymous, aggregated profiling and session data may include information provided to us through surveys, polls, etc., but will not be tied to any Personal Information without consent. The non-personal information collected may also include aggregated Anonymous Information about site usage and the customer base.</p>
<p>As you navigate our Website or use the wefi Community Services, certain information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use "Cookies" and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and viewed. This type of information is collected to better understand how you use our community and make the community and the Services we provide more useful to you. Most browsers are automatically set to accept Cookies. Please contact your PC consultant if you need additional information on Cookies. Personal information collected through the use of cookies and other technology will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you would like more information about cookies and how to control and delete cookies in various browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera and Chrome, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/" title="AboutCookies.org">http://www.aboutcookies.org/</a>.</p>
<p>When you use our wefi Software to improve your connectivity, the Services collects information about the device on which the wefi Software is executed, including without limitation, the hardware address of its network adapter, basic usage statistics about your device and your use of the wefi Software and Services.</p>
<p>The wefi Software also transmits information to the Services regarding the Access Points you are using to establish an online connection, including, without limitation, the names (SSIDs) of the Access Points, location and identification of the Access Points, connection status, speed and duration and access control methods. We may connect such information with Personal Information we have collected from you to provide you with specific location-based services that are tailored to meet your needs or interests, to improve our wefi Software and Services or to enforce the agreements, terms and conditions related to our wefi Software and Services.</p>
<p>An <strong>"Internet protocol address"</strong> or <strong>"IP Address"</strong> is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track IP Addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page flow.</p>
<p><strong>"Cookies"</strong> are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Website. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Website may not work properly.</p>
<p>We may also contract with third parties in order to promote the products and/or services of these third parties by placing ads on the Website. We may use information that was posted by wefi Members to tailor the display of ads to the interest of the Users. Clicking on such ads will direct you to the website of the third party and the third party may also use Cookies in connection with these ads.
