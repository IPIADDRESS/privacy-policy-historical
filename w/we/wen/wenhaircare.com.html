	<a name="Information_Collection"></a>
	<h3 class="sub-titlecontent"><span class="text-no">1.</span>Information Collection</h3>
	<p>We collect personally identifiable information about you via our Websites when you provide it through various forms and places on the Websites such as in connection with a request or purchase of a product, service, or information or if you register for a Website account. You may browse our Websites without providing any personal information; however if, for example, you decide to place an order, we will ask you for your name, age, delivery and billing address, phone number(s), email address, and payment information such as credit/debit card number, expiration dates, PayPal or third party payment information. If you choose to complete a user registration form, survey, we may ask you for personal information, such as your contact information (e.g., name, e-mail address and mailing address). Occasionally, we may also ask you for other demographic information, such as gender, income level, and information about your prior experiences with the Company's products.  If we combine demographic information with the personal information we collect directly from you on our Websites, we will treat the combined data as personal information under this Privacy Policy.  When you submit your personally identifiable or demographic information on one of the Websites, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
	</p>

	<p>We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Websites, such as when they submit your information to us about you.  Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Websites with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you.  For example, if you choose to have your purchase delivered to another person’s address, we may ask for the other person’s name and delivery address. We will use this information to deliver your purchase to the address you choose to have it delivered. You may delete the other person’s information from your account or the other person may contact us at <a class="email-link link-text" href="mailto:privacy@guthy-renker.com">privacy@guthy-renker.com</a> to request that we remove their information from our database. Note: Although you can remove the information from your account for future orders, the other person’s information may be retained with the original transaction for auditing and legal purposes. In no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.
	</p>

	<p>We may also use the tracking technologies described in Section 5 below in order to automatically (or passively) collect, store or accumulate certain non-personally identifiable information concerning your use of this Website, such as information regarding which of our pages are most popular and remembering you and your preferences, your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier, device functionality (including browser, operator system, hardware, mobile network information), device location, device characteristics, city, time zone, and referring URL.  Information gathered may be used in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics, developing marketing plans, customizing content, and improving the Website.  This usage information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device whenever you visit or interact with our Site.  We may share or transfer such aggregate, non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees, partners and other third parties.
	</p>

	<p>We may combine automatically collected Website usage information with your Personal Information. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.
	</p>

	<p>All of our Websites are intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.  We will delete any personal information collected that we later determine to be from a user younger than the age of 13.  If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personal information to us, please contact Customer Service using the contact information below.

Please allow up to ten (10) days for us to process your request.  This will not affect subsequent subscriptions and if your opt-out is limited to certain types or categories of emails the opt-out will be so limited.  Please note, if you opt not to receive marketing emails from the Company, you may still receive "transactional" email messages regarding your account, use of the Websites or your order (e.g., order confirmation, shipping information, recall notices, customer service notifications, etc.). If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please contact Customer Service.</p>
	<p>The Company may share non-personal information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties.  The Company may also share and sell your information, such as your name, email address, mailing address and/or telephone number to business partners, vendors and other third party organizations to provide you with information about products, services and special offers we think may interest you or to improve our products, services and advertising.  If you are a California resident, you have the right to request additional information about this sharing, so please see Section 12 below.  In addition, we may share the information we have collected about you, including personal information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy. </p>
	<p>We may contract with companies or individuals to provide certain services including email and hosting services, credit card processing, shipping, data management, surveys and marketing, promotional services, to assist in preventing or deterring fraud, etc. We call them our “Service Providers”.

	<p>Some web browsers are developing or offering signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services (e.g., a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") signal).

	<a name="Ads_and_Information_About_You"></a>
	<h3 class="sub-titlecontent"><span class="text-no">7.</span>Ads and Information About You</h3>
	<p>We may work with third parties, such as network advertisers and ad exchanges that use tracking technologies on our Websites in order to provide tailored advertisements on our behalf and/or on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet and we may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party sites and viewing of ads and of our content.  Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your activities (including past visits to our Websites) across the Internet and mobile media (“Behavioral Ads”).  Behavioral Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which we believe you might be interested.  If you object to receiving Behavioral Ads from us on third party sites, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below.  Our third party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own technologies on your device and track certain behavioral usage information via a device identifier.  These third party technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements; and (c) understand the usefulness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.   </p>
	<p>Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect.  We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice.  We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.</p>
	<p>Further, while sites use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit <a class="link-text" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members.  Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads.  Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.  You may also opt-out of receiving Behavioral Ads on participating sites and services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) website at <a class="link-text" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> (or if located in the European Union click <a class="link-text" href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">here</a>).  Similar limitations may apply to the DAA opt-out.  We are not responsible for effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties’ opt-out options or programs.</p>
