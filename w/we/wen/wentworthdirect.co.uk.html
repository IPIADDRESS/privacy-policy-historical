            <h2>Third party providers and data privacy</h2>
            <p>If you decide to enter into a contract with a third party provider through a   channel on our website, the information you have provided to us together with   any further information requested by, and supplied by you to, the third party   provider will be held by the provider for the purposes set out in that   provider's privacy policy. Therefore, you are strongly advised to read your   chosen provider's privacy policy and satisfy yourself as to the purposes for   which the provider will use your personal information before entering into the   contract. We have no responsibility for the uses to which a provider puts your   personal information once you have contracted with that provider.</p>
            <h2>Advertisements</h2>
            <p>No personal data for example your name, address, email address or telephone   number are used during the course of serving our advertising, but, on our   behalf, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on   your browser. This cookie does not collect personal data about you nor is it   linked to any personal data about you</p>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>No data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be totally   secure. As a result, whilst we strive to protect your personal information, we   cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information which you send to us,   and you do so at your own risk.</p>
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>A cookie is a very small text file placed on your computer by a web browser,   which has been sent by a web server. It is essentially an "identification card"   relating to you. The main purpose of our cookies is to identify you when you   visit our website. Each time your browser requests a web page from our server,   the browser sends the information in the text file back to the server and lets   the server know that you have returned to that web page. We use cookies to   provide you with a better service tailored to suit you. </p>
            <p>Cookies help you to save time. For example, if you register for our Services,   a cookie helps us to remember who you are and what your preferences are. Next   time you return, we can fill in any questions that you have already answered.   The more you tell us about yourself, the more we can help to find information or   products you want.</p>
            <p>If you do not accept incoming cookies then the performance of our website on   your system will not be to full standard or our website may not serve at   all.</p>
            <h2>Transferring your information abroad</h2>
            <p>Information supplied by you to us will only be transferred abroad by us or   our agents for the purpose of performing contractual obligations to you, or when   you have given your prior consent to such transfer.</p>
            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>You have certain rights under the Data Protection Act 1998. For example, we   will always let you have a copy of all personal information we have about you   should you request it. We may charge you a fee for a copy of such information.</p>
