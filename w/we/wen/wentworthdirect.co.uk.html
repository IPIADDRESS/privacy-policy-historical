								<h2>Cookies</h2>
								<p>A cookie is a very small text file placed on your computer by a web browser, 
									which has been sent by a web server. It is essentially an "identification 
									card" relating to you. The main purpose of our cookies is to identify you 
									when you visit our website. Each time your browser requests a web page from our 
									server, the browser sends the information in the text file back to the server 
									and lets the server know that you have returned to that web page. We use 
									cookies to provide you with a better service tailored to suit you.
								</p>
								<p>Cookies help you to save time. For example, if you register for our Services, a 
									cookie helps us to remember who you are and what your preferences are. Next 
									time you return, we can fill in any questions that you have already answered. 
									The more you tell us about yourself, the more we can help to find information 
									or products you want.</p>
								<p>If you do not accept incoming cookies then the performance of our website on 
									your system will not be to full standard or our website may not serve at all.</p>
