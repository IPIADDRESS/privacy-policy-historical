<h1>Correcting/Updating Personal Information; Cancelling Subscriptions</h1>
<p>The Web Site may contain web pages through which you can correct or update some of the personal information you have provided to us through registration with the Web Site. With regard to subscriptions, you also may cancel (or modify, if applicable) your subscriptions by following the instructions provided to you in applicable communications regarding such subscriptions.</p>
<h1>Registering and Obtaining Tickets</h1>
<p>BY REGISTERING AND OBTAINING TICKETS TO “THE WENDY WILLIAMS SHOW,” YOU CONSENT TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED BY MEANS OF VIDEO RECORDING AND YOU GRANT THE PRODUCER OF THE FOOTAGE, ITS SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, CARRIER STATIONS, NETWORK STATION(S), SPONSOR(S) OF THE PROGRAM AND MARKETING AND ADVERTISING AGENTS (AS WELL AS THEIR AFFILIATED AND RELATED ENTITIES) THE RIGHT TO RECORD AND USE YOUR NAME, VOICE, AND LIKENESS WORLDWIDE IN PERPETUITY FOR ANY PURPOSE WHATSOEVER. IN ADDITION YOU RELEASE THE ABOVE PARTIES FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF DAMAGE TO YOUR PERSON OR PROPERTY WHILE AT OR AROUND THE PREMISES, AND YOU AGREE TO COMPLY WITH ALL RULES AND REGULATIONS OF COMPANY, THE PRODUCER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DEBMAR-MERCURY LLC AND LIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CORP.</p>
<h1>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h1>
<p>Company allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Web Site. For example, if you “click” on a banner advertisement, the “click” may take you off the Web Site onto a different web site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use the Web Site’s logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Web Site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.<br>
Company does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Company to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, women ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, women ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Web Site, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.</p>
<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers subsequently shared with Company is maintained and dealt with by Company in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h1>International Users</h1>
<p>The Web Site is hosted in the United States and is intended for and directed to users in the United States. If you are a user accessing the Web Site from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Web Site, which is governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Use, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.</p>
<h1>Security</h1>
<p>Company uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure, warrant or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to Company and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Company makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
<p>If Company learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Company may post a notice on the Web Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at <a href="mailto:productionattorney@wendyshow.com">productionattorney@wendyshow.com </a>.</p>
<h1>Children’s Privacy</h1>
<p>The Web Site is a general audience web site. Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children’s use of online activities regularly. The Web Site supports and complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and other laws. The Web Site is not aimed at nor intended for children under the age of 13 and we will delete any information later determined to be from a user younger than thirteen (13). If you are under the age of 13, please do not use the Web Site. Our Web Site does not accept registration from children under the age of 13. No personally identifiable information (as defined in the COPPA, 15 U.S.C. Section 6501) is purposefully or knowingly collected from children under the age of 13 by Company on the Web Site without parental consent. Every user hereby agrees that all information you provide, including but not limited to age, shall be truthful and correct. Company will not condition a child’s participation in an online activity on the child providing more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary for participation in such activity.</p>
<h1>California Privacy Rights</h1>
<p>A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.</p>
<p>However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described information if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.</p>
<p>As stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure — typically by opting in to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. If you do ask us to share your information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on the Web Site. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.</p>
<p>California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing <a href="mailto:productionattorney@wendyshow.com">productionattorney@wendyshow.com </a>. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.</p>
<h1>Notification Of Changes And Your Acceptance Of The Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>By using the Web Site, you acknowledge your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. From time to time, Company may update this Privacy Policy. However, Company will use your personal information in a manner consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time you submitted the information, unless you consent to the new or revised policy. Your continued use of the Web Site constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any future revisions.</p>
<p>For revisions to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of the personal information you have already provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing such revisions with respect to such information.</p>
