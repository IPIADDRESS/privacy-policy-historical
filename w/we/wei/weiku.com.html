                This is the Privacy Policy governing your use of Weiku.com. By using this Site,
                you consent to our Privacy Policy set out below. All terms not defined in this document
                have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Use Agreement between you and
                Weiku.com which by use of this Site you agree to accept.</p>
            <span>How We May Use Information</span>
            <ul>
                <li>â€¢&nbsp;General: We use your Collected Information to improve our marketing
                    and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content
                    and product offerings and to customize our Site's content, layout and service specifically
                    for you. We may use your Collected Information to service your Account with us,
                    including but not limited to investigating problems, resolving disputes and enforcing
                    agreements with us. We do not sell, rent, trade or exchange any personally-identifying
                    information of our Users. We may share certain aggregate information based on analysis
                    of Collected Information with our partners, customers, advertisers or potential
                    Users. We may use your Collected Information to execute marketing campaigns, promotions
                    or advertising messages on behalf of third parties; however, in these circumstances,
                    your Collected Information will not be disclosed to such third parties unless you
                    respond to the marketing, promotion or advertising message.</li>
                <li>â€¢&nbsp;Registration Information: We may use your Registration Information
                    to provide services that you request or to contact you regarding additional services
                    about which Weiku.com determines that you might be interested. Specifically, we
                    may use your email address, mailing address, phone number or fax number to contact
                    you regarding notices, surveys, product alerts, new service or product offerings
                    and communications relevant to your use of our Site. We may generate reports and
                    analysis based on the Registration Information for internal analysis, monitoring
                    and marketing decisions.<br>
                    Publishing Information: All of your Publishing Information will be publicly available
                    on the Site and therefore accessible by any internet user. Any Publishing Information
                    that you disclose to Weiku.com becomes public information and you relinquish any
                    proprietary rights (including but not limited to the rights of confidentiality and
                    copyrights) in such information. You should exercise caution when deciding to include
                    personal or proprietary information in the Publishing Information that you submit
                    to us.</li>
                <li>â€¢&nbsp;Payment Information: Weiku.com will share your Payment Information
                    with banks or vendors relevant to the transaction in order to enable transactions
                    to be completed. In addition, Weiku.com may use Payment Information to determine
                    your credit-worthiness and, in the process of such determination, Weiku.com may
                    make such Payment Information available to banks or credit agencies. Any credit
                    card information that you provide through the Site is directly submitted to a payment
                    server of the credit card processing bank. Weiku.com does not maintain electronic
                    or physical copies of your credit card information. While Weiku.com has in place
                    up-to-date technology and internal procedures to guard your Payment Information
                    against intruders, there is no guarantee that such technology or procedure can eliminate
                    all of the risks of theft, loss or mis-use. Weiku.com shall not be liable to you
                    or any other person for any damages that might result from unauthorized use, publication,
                    disclosure or any other mis-use of Payment Information, including credit card information.</li>
                <li>â€¢&nbsp;Statistical Information: We use Statistical Information to help diagnose
                    problems and maintain our computer servers, to manage our Site, and to enhance our
                    Site and services based on the usage pattern data we receive. We may generate reports
                    and analysis based on the Statistical Information for internal analysis, monitoring
                    and marketing decisions. We may provide Statistical Information to third parties,
                    but when we do so, we do not provide personally-identifying information without
                    your permission.</li>
            </ul>
            <span>Disclosure of Information</span>
            <ul>
                <li>We reserve the right to disclose your Collected Information to relevant authorities
                    where we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact
                    or bring legal action against someone who may be infringing or threatening to infringe,
                    or who may otherwise be causing injury to or interference with, the title, rights,
                    interests or property of Weiku.com, our Users, customers, partners, other web site
                    users or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We also reserve the
                    right to disclose Collected Information in response to a subpoena or other judicial
                    order or when we reasonably believe that such disclosure is required by law, regulation
                    or administrative order of any court, governmental or regulatory authority. If we
                    have reason to believe that a User is in breach of the Terms of User Agreement or
                    any other agreement with us, then we reserve the right to make public or otherwise
                    disclose such User's Collected Information in order to pursue our claim or prevent
                    further injury to Weiku or others.</li>
            </ul>
            <span>Co-Branded Relationships</span>
            <ul>
                <li>We have established relationships with other parties to offer you the benefit of
                    other products and services which we ourselves do not offer. We offer you access
                    to these other parties either through the use of hyperlinks to their sites from
                    our Site, or through offering "co-branded" sites in which both ourselves and these
                    other parties share the same uniform resource locator, domain name or pages within
                    a domain name on the Internet. In some cases you may be required to submit information
                    for purposes of registering or applying for products or services provided by such
                    third parties or co-branded partners. The privacy policy of such other parties may
                    differ from ours, and we may not have any control over the information that you
                    submit to such third parties or co-branded sites. We therefore encourage you to
                    read that policy before responding to any offers, products or services provided
                    by such other parties.</li>
