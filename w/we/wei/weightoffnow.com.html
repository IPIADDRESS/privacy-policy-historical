                  All information collected through this site will be kept

                  This site may contain links to other sites at which personal

                  expressly provided to the contrary, the collection and use of

                  Any personal information you provide will be used only in ways 
                  that you have consented to. If you contact us to place an

                  contact you about the order. This information may be shared

                  When ordering products or services on this site, you may be 
                  asked to provide a credit card number. Depending upon the 
                  activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide 
                  is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do

                  activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.<br>

                  We may use your personal information to contact you for

                  When you visit this site, you can browse and access important 
                  information without revealing your identity. In order to 
                  improve our site, we use "cookies" to track your visit. A 
                  cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your 
                  browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server 
                  that gave it to you.<br>

                  Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set 
                  your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving 
                  you the chance to decide whether to accept it. (For some Web 
                  pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. 
                  Users choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able 
                  to access those pages.)<br>

                  While we use cookies to track your visit, and our Web servers 
                  automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, we 
                  do not use this information to identify you personally.<br>
