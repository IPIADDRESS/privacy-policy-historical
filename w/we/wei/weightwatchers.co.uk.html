"Cookies" are small text files that are placed on your computer in order to identify (i) your Web browser, (ii) the activities of your computer on our Website and (iii) your activity in connection with our advertisements and other marketing and promotional efforts. Cookies are used to <br><ul><li>personalise your experience on our Website (such as dynamically generating content on webpages specifically designed for you),</li><li>assist you in using our Internet Products (such as saving time by not having to reenter your name upon each visit to our Website),</li><li>allow us to statistically monitor how you are using our Website to help us improve our online offerings.</li></ul>	
We also may use cookies to conduct marketing and promotional efforts, tailor certain advertisements to your browser that we think may be of interest to you, or to determine the popularity of certain content.<br><br>
In addition to cookies that we place on your computer, cookies may also be placed on your computer by third parties that we use to display or serve advertisements or to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information in order to provide advertising-related services. For example, DoubleClick Inc. ("DoubleClick") and Avenue A, LLC, which employs Atlas DMT ("Atlas") technology, place cookies in the course of serving advertisements for us. Neither DoubleClick, Atlas nor their cookies collect Personally Identifiable Information on our Website, and we do not share Personally Identifiable Information with them without your permission. <a href="javascript:void(window.open('http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/'));">DoubleClick's privacy policy</a> describes its data collection practices and explains the way in which you can "opt-out" of certain tracking by DoubleClick. <a href="javascript:void(window.open('http://www.atlasdmt.com/privacy/'));">Atlas's privacy policy</a> describes its data collection practices and explains the way in which you can "opt-out" of certain tracking by Atlas.<br><br>
You do not have to accept cookies to use our Website.  Although most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you may reset your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally.  Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the "Help" section of the toolbar.  While you are not required to accept our cookies to access our Website, if you reject cookies, certain products, offerings, features, or resources of our Website (including certain Internet Products) may not work properly and you may experience some loss of convenience.<br><br>
"Action tags," also known as web beacons or gif tags, are a web technology used to help track website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed. Action tags are invisible to you, and any portion of our Website, including advertisements, or e-mail sent on our behalf, may contain cookies that are associated with action tags that our located on our Website. Unlike cookies, action tags are not placed on your computer.<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" role="presentation"></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0" role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td height="15"></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%" role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">We may select and use different third parties from time to time to track website usage through action tags on our Website and on our advertisements on other websites. For example, DoubleClick and Atlas each track anonymous website usage by setting a cookie (or reading a cookie previously placed by them) on users' computers to track the activities of users who view a web page that contains action tags. DoubleClick and Atlas may use information about your visits to this Website and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by one of these companies, please refer to its respective Privacy Policy. Many Internet users already have a DoubleClick and/or Atlas cookie on their computer today, and tracking through the use of action tags is considered common practice in the industry. Periodically, upon our request, DoubleClick and/or Atlas may report the anonymous data that they collect on our behalf back to us for our internal use and analysis and our treatment of this anonymous data is governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to gain valuable information to improve our Website and our Internet Products and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns. We do not disclose any of your Personally Identifiable Information to our advertising partners through the use of cookies or action tags.<br><br>
Finally, please note that advertisers and other third parties may also use their own cookies or action tags when you click on their advertisement or link to their website or service, on or from our Website.  This Privacy Policy does not govern the use by such third-party websites or providers of third-party advertising.<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" role="presentation"></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0" role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td height="15"></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><b class="subhead"><span class="darker"><i><b>Referral Programmes.</b></i></span></b><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%" role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Through third party referral programme operators and others, we offer referral programmes whereby referral websites can earn commissions through the referral of subscribers or other purchasers to our Website.

We want your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to remain as secure as possible.  We strive to provide secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers through industry-standard techniques.  To help ensure the integrity and privacy of the Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us via the Internet at the time you elect to become a community user or subscribe to our Internet Products, we use Secured Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in transmitting such Personally Identifiable Information over the Internet to our servers.  We secure the Personally Identifiable Information you provide on servers located in controlled, secure environments, protected from unauthorised access, use, or alteration.  Only employees who need access to your information to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such information.  In addition, all WeightWatchers.co.uk employees must abide by this Privacy Policy and are kept up-to-date on security practices.  Any employee who violates this Privacy Policy is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.<br><br>
Notwithstanding the above commitments to protect your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) from loss, misuse or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet.  There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems.
