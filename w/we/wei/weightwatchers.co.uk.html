âCookiesâ are small text files that are stored by your web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer or Safari) on your computerâs hard drive or on your mobile phone.  They allow websites to store such things as user preferences.  You can think of cookies as providing a âmemoryâ for a website, enabling it to recognise a user and respond appropriately.<br>
Websites use both session cookies and persistent cookies.  Session cookies are temporary cookies that expire (and are automatically erased) when you close your browser.  Persistent cookies usually have an expiration date far into the future and thus stay in your browser until they expire, or until you manually delete them.  We use persistent cookies for functionalities like the âRemember me on this computerâ feature, which makes it possible for you to return to the site without having to log in.  In addition to cookies set by the website you are visiting (first party cookies), both session and persistent cookies may be set by others (third party cookies).  For example, analytics firms, social media sites and advertising networks may all set cookies when you visit other sites with which they have relationships.<br><br><span class="darker"><i><b>What Types of Cookies Do We Use?</b></i></span><br>

The cookies generated when you visit our website fall into the following categories:<br><br><span class="darker"><i><b>Strictly necessary cookies.</b></i></span>
These cookies enable services you have specifically asked for.  No consent is required for the use of these cookies.<br><br>
        For example, when you subscribe to one of our Internet Products or register as a community user, we use session cookies to signal that you are logged in so that you are able to use community or subscriber features of the Website, and persistent cookies to provide automatic login.<br><br><span class="darker"><i><b>Performance cookies.</b></i></span>
These cookies collect anonymous information about how you use the Website.  By using the Website or becoming a community user or subscriber, you agree that we can place these types of cookies.<br><br>
We use performance cookies for web analytics, which allow us to statistically monitor how people are using our Website, to help us improve our online offerings as well as to test different design ideas for particular pages. We work with independent measurement and research companies to perform these services for us, so some of these cookies may be set by a third party company.<br><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" role="presentation"></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0" role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td height="15"></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%" role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">In particular, we use Adobe SiteCatalyst to help us track and analyze usage of our Website, using cookies and action tags.

Our website offers you the option to connect your Weight Watchers account with third party applications or devices (each a âTrackerâ) such as activity trackers that measure your activity level (e.g. the number of steps and distance walked, calories burned and other personal metrics). When you have purchased such a Tracker from Weight Watchers (e.g. in a Weight Watchers meeting room or online) and set up your account with the provider of the Tracker , the provider might know that this Tracker was purchased from Weight Watchers. During the set-up of your account with such provider, you might therefore be asked whether you want to connect this third party account with your Weight Watchers account. Alternatively, you will be able to connect your Weight Watchers account with your third party account  in other ways, such as on the Weight Watchers website, regardless of where you have purchased your Tracker. If you connect the two accounts, the provider of your Tracker will know that you have a Weight Watchers account. At the same time, data collected via the Tracker (for example, personal activity data collected) will be transferred to us so that we can update and personalize your Weight Watchers account (for example, to display activity <i><b>ProPoints</b></i>Â® values earned) in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. You have the option to disconnect the Trackers from your Weight Watchers account at any time via our website.
