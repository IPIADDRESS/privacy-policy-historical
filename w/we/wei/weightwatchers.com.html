<h3 align="CENTER"><font size="+2">PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT</font></h3>

<p>This is the web site of Weight Watchers</p>

<p>Our postal address is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>175 Crossways Park West<br>
  Woodbury, NY 11797<br>
  Attention: Consumer Affairs Dept. IN</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or you can reach us via fax at: 1-516-390-1632<br>
or you can reach us by telephone at: 1-516-390-1657</p>

<p>Weight Watchers historically has respected our members'
rights to privacy. We continue to support this policy in the online arena
and feel it is our obligation to clearly state our privacy policy to all
site visitors.</p>

<p>For each visitor to our website, our web server automatically recognizes
only the consumer's domain name, but not the email address. We use this
information to better understand visitors' use of our site. We collect domain
names so that we can aggregate information on what pages consumers access
or visit. The information we collect is used for internal review to improve
the content of our Web site.</p>

<p>Email addresses and other personally identifying data about visitors
are known to Weight Watchers only when voluntarily submitted to us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>MAILING LIST</b><br>
We welcome visitors to become a part of our mailing list and provide access
to do so throughout the site. From time to time, we may use this information
to contact visitors about products, services, events or news that we believe
will be of interest.</p>

<p>We do not share this information with other organizations and will not
disseminate it to parties outside of our organization.</p>

<p>Once on the list, we may notify consumers from time to time about updates
to our website and contact consumers for marketing purposes. For example,
we may email visitors, who provide us with their email addresses, for specific
purposes such as receiving email newsletters, updates of site events or
being notified if they have won one of our contests.</p>

<p>In response to completing our mailing list form, Weight Watchers International
will maintain the name, postal address and email address as provided to
us.</p>

<p>If a visitor does not want to continue receiving mail from us in the
future, they can let us know by returning to the <b>Contact Us</b> or <b>Guestbook</b>
page form and select <b>NO</b> to the question: <i>Do you want to be added
to our mailing list?</i> Complete the form and hit <b><i>Submit</i></b>.
We will then remove the name from our mailing list.</p>

<p>If a visitor supplies us with a postal address online, they may receive
periodic mailings with information on new services, products, and upcoming
events. To be removed from the mailing list, a visitor may fill out the
online form (responding <b>NO</b> to the question: <i>Do you want to be
on our mailing list?</i>) or by writing or faxing to the addresses on the
top of this Privacy Policy page.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>FORUM PRIVACY</b><br>
Weight Watchers does not collect or maintain any of
the names and/or addresses that individuals attach to postings in our Forum,
unless otherwise specified. However, because our Forum is truly an open
public dialogue for the entire internet population, once name and/or address
is posted to the Forum other individuals and/or organizations may have access
to that information just as they would if a name and address was left in
any other public venue.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting www.weightwatchers.com. We appreciate your involvement
and hope you enjoy it and find it beneficial.
