		<b>WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT ME IS COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE?</b>
		<br>
		We collect  two types of information:  personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.
		<br><br>
		<b>Personally Identifiable Information</b>
		<br>
		Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you ("Personally Identifiable Information").  Such Personally Identifiable Information may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, birth date (primarily for eligibility purposes) and billing and credit card information.  We may request Personally Identifiable Information from you when you register on our Website, subscribe to our Online Products, or sign our Guestbook, or in connection with other Online Products we may make available on our Website from time to time.  In all of these cases, we will collect Personally Identifiable Information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us.  Unless you give us permission to do so, we will not sell, share, license, trade or rent your Personally Identifiable Information other than as specified in this Privacy Policy.
		<br><br>
		You do not have to provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information to visit our Website.  However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to visit all sections of our Website or use all of our Online Products, such as subscribing to our online weight loss tools, posting messages on our message boards or visiting our chat rooms.  In addition, we may not be able to provide you with some of the other Online Products dependent upon the collection of such information, such as a personalized WeightWatchers.com home page.
		<br><br>
		<b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b>
		<br>
		When you become a registered user of our Website, subscribe to one of our current Online Products, or in connection with other Online Products we may make available on our Website from time to time, we also may collect information that by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (like age, profession or gender) and health information (like current weight) ("Non-Personally Identifiable Information").  Non-Personally Identifiable Information may also include user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Website.  Non-Personally Identifiable Information is used to help us understand who uses our Website and to improve and market our Website in general and our Online Products in particular.
		<br><br>
		<b>Information from Other Sources</b>
		<br>
		We may also supplement the information we collect with information from other sources to assist us in evaluating and improving our Website and Online Products, to determine your preferences so that we can tailor our Website and Online Products to your needs, and/or to study nutritional, weight loss, behavioral and fitness questions in general.

		<b>WHERE AND WHEN IS INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE (INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF COOKIES AND ACTION TAGS)?</b>
		<br>
		We may collect information (including information that is Personally Identifiable Information) from you in different manners and at different places and times on our Website, such as when you register for our Website, subscribe to one of our Online Products, or sign our Guestbook.  We also may collect information from you in connection with, or through, other Online Products we may make available on our Website from time to time. The following is a description of the areas and/or manners in which we primarily collect information about you.
		<br><br>
		<b><i>Becoming a Registered User and Subscription.</i></b>
		<br>
		In order to access certain Online Products on our Website, such as our chat rooms, message boards, weight loss tools and food database, you must first complete certain steps to become either a registered user or a subscriber.  During these steps, you may be required to provide us with information (including Personally Identifiable Information) such as name, zip code and email address, and, if you subscribe to one of our Online Products, credit card and billing information. This information is used to help us understand who uses our Website, to improve our Website and our Online Products, to contact users about requested Online Products and/or for subscription billing purposes.  It is optional for you to provide demographic information (such as profession and number of children), but providing this information is encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our Website.
		<br><br>
		<b><i>Cookies and Action Tags.</i></b>
		<br>
		
		We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information passively using "cookies" and "action tags."
		<br><br>
		"Cookies" are small text files that are placed on your computer in order to identify (i) your Web browser (ii) the activities of your computer on our Website and (iii) your activity in connection with our advertisements and other marketing and promotional efforts.  Cookies may be used to:
		<ul>
			<li>personalize your experience on our Website (e.g., to dynamically generate content on webpages specifically designed for you), </li>
			<li>assist you in using our Online Products (e.g., to save you time by not having to reenter your name upon each visit to our Website), and</li>
			<li>allow us to statistically monitor how you are using our Website for purposes of improving our online offerings.</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		We also may use cookies to conduct marketing and promotional efforts, tailor certain advertisements to your browser that we think may be of interest to you, or to determine the popularity of certain content.
		<br><br>
		In addition to cookies that we place on your computer, cookies may also be placed on your computer by third parties that we use to display or serve advertisements or to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information in order to provide advertising-related services. In the course of serving advertisements, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. We have selected DoubleClick Inc. ("DoubleClick"), Avenue A, Inc. ("Avenue A"), and Poindexter Systems Inc. ("Poindexter")  as our third party ad servers. Neither DoubleClick, Avenue A, Poindexter, nor their cookies collect Personally Identifiable Information on our Website, and we do not share Personally Identifiable Information with them without your permission. <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy" target="_blank">DoubleClick's privacy policy</a>, describes its data collection practices and explains the way in which you can "opt-out" of certain tracking by DoubleClick.  <a href="http://www.avenuea.com/info/optout.asp" target="_blank">Avenue A's privacy policy</a> describes its data collection practices and explains the way in which you can "opt-out" of certain tracking by Avenue A. <a href="http://www.poindextersystems.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">Poindexter's privacy policy</a>, describes its data collection practices and explains the way in which you can "opt-out" of certain tracking by Poindexter.

		<br><br>
		You do not have to accept cookies to use our Website, however, you may not be able to use certain products, offerings, features, or resources of our Website (including our Online Products) if you do not accept cookies.  Although most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you may reset your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally. Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the "Help" section of the toolbar. 
		<br><br>
		"Action tags," also known as web beacons or GIF tags, are a web technology used to help track anonymous website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed.  Action tags are invisible to you, and any portion of our Website, including advertisements, or e-mail sent on our behalf, may contain cookies that are associated with action tags that are located on our Website.  Unlike cookies, action tags are not placed on your computer.  
		<br><br>
		DoubleClick, Avenue A and Poindexter each track anonymous website usage through action tags on our Website and other websites.  DoubleClick, Avenue A and Poindexter do this by setting a cookie (or reading a cookie previously placed by them) on users' computers to track the activities of users who view a web page that contains action tags. DoubleClick, Avenue A and Poindexter may use information about your visits to this Website and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by (i) DoubleClick, <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy" target="_blank">click here</a>,(ii) Avenue A, <a href="http://www.avenuea.com/info/optout.asp" target="_blank">click here</a>, and/or (iii) Poindexter  <a href="http://www.poindextersystems.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">click here</a>.  Many Internet users already have a DoubleClick, Avenue A and/or Poindexter cookie on their computer today, and tracking through the use of action tags is considered common practice in the industry.  Periodically, upon our request, DoubleClick, Avenue A and/or Poindexter may report the anonymous data that they collect on our behalf back to us for our internal use and analysis and our treatment of this anonymous data is governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy.  
		<br><br>
		By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to gain valuable information to improve our Website and our Online Products and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns. We do not disclose any of your Personally Identifiable Information to our advertising partners through the use of cookies or action tags.
		<br><br>
		Finally, please note that advertisers and other third parties may also use their own cookies or action tags when you click on their advertisement or link to their website or service, on or from our Website. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use by such third-party websites or providers of third-party advertising.
		<br><br>
		
		
		
		<b><i>Referral Programs.</i></b><br>
		Through third party affiliate program operators, we offer referral programs whereby affiliates can earn commissions through the referral of subscribers to our Website.  To track the earning of such commissions, and to determine the effectiveness of the referral programs, our third party affiliate program operators track the referring websites and the users who become subscribers to our Online Products through such referring websites.  This is done cookies and action tags that do not include Personally Identifiable Information.

		We may provide to third parties information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our Website.  For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our Website, the demographic breakdown of our registered user of our Website, or the activities that visitors to our Website engage in while on our Website.  The third parties to which we may provide this information may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising services (including website tracking services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties.
		<br><br>
		<b><i>Outside Contractors.</i></b>
		<br>
		We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, "Outside Contractors") to provide specific services and products related to our Website, such as hosting and maintaining our chat rooms, providing credit card processing and fraud screening, and developing applications for our Website and e-mail services.  These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected on our Website, including your Personally Identifiable Information, in the course of providing products or services to us.  Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited function for us.  We also require that these contractors (i) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us with products or services for which we contracted.
		<br><br>
		<b><i>Third Party Sellers.</i></b>
		<br>
		In addition, through our Website, you may be given the opportunity to purchase (or to obtain more information) regarding certain content, products or services which are sold through a person or company other than us or our Affiliates (collectively, "Third Party Sellers").  Similarly, if you purchase a product or service through one of our co-branded stores, you will likely be purchasing the product through a Third Party Seller and not from us.  We will attempt to make it clear to you when you are dealing with a Third Party Seller by opening a new browser or otherwise notifying you that you are leaving our Website.  For example, if you see a phrase such as "powered by" or "brought to you by" followed by the name of a person or company other than WeightWatchers.com, then you are likely on, or about to enter, a website hosted or operated by a person or company other than us.  Third Party Sellers may request that you submit certain information to them in order to purchase their products or services or to obtain additional information from them.  You do not need to submit this information or purchase any products or services from Third Party Sellers to access our Website.  By submitting the requested information, you affirmatively consent to have that information shared with the Third Party Seller.  This information is used by the Third Party Seller and may be subject to a different privacy policy.  We do not otherwise share or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to Third Party Sellers.
		<br><br>
		<b><i>Sale of Business.</i></b>
		<br>
		We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of WeightWatchers.com, Inc. or Weight Watchers International, Inc. provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  We will notify users of any such transfer through notice on our site and through email.

		<b>DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY WHEN I LINK TO OTHER WEBSITES?</b>
		<br>
		Our Website contains links to other websites not owned or operated by WeightWatchers.com (for example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, you will likely be taken off our Website), including links to websites operated by franchisees of Weight Watchers International.  We will attempt to make it obvious to you when you leave our Website and enter these websites by opening a new browser or otherwise notifying you that you are leaving our Website.  However, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites.  We encourage you to be aware when our Website links to other websites and to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every website.  This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Website.

		<b>IS THE INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE SECURE?</b>
		<br>
		We want your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to remain as secure as possible.  We strive to provide secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers through industry-standard techniques.  To help ensure the integrity and privacy of the Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us via the Internet at the time you elect to become a registered user or subscribe to our Online Products, we use Secured Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in transmitting such Personally Identifiable Information over the Internet to our servers.  We secure the Personally Identifiable Information you provide on servers located in controlled, secure environments, protected from unauthorized access, use, or alteration.  Only employees who need access to your information to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such information.  In addition, all WeightWatchers.com employees must abide by this Privacy Policy and are kept up-to-date on security practices.  Any employee who violates this Privacy Policy is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
		<br><br>
		Notwithstanding the above commitments to protect your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) from loss, misuse or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet.  There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems.  As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

		<b>WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING THE COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</b>
		<br>
		Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you.  You must "opt-in" and give us permission to use your Personally Identifiable Information for any other purpose.  For example, we have an "opt-in" mechanism so that those who become registered users or subscribe to our Website must give us permission to send them marketing materials and our electronic newsletter.  You may also change your preference and "opt-out" of receiving such communications by changing that option in the My Profile feature of our Website, following the directions provided in association with the communication, or by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@weightwatchers.com">privacy@weightwatchers.com</a>.
		<br><br>
		Users of our Website are notified when Personally Identifiable Information is being collected by third parties on our Website.  We do this so you can make an informed choice as to whether you should disclose information to a third party.
		<br><br>
		In addition, as noted above, you may "opt-out" of certain data tracking practices by our advertising partners.  For more information about the data tracking practices of various third-party advertising companies, including their privacy practices and "opt-out" procedures, please go to the website operated by the Network Advertising Initiative at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>.

		<b>CAN I UPDATE OR CORRECT MY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</b>
		<br>
		You can always contact us in order to (1) update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the Personally Identifiable Information maintained about you on our systems, by accessing My Profile or contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@weightwatchers.com">privacy@weightwatchers.com</a>.  Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will not have an effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third-parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.
		<br><br>
		You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system.  The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your Personally Identifiable Information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate.  We promise that promptly after receiving your request, all Personally Identifiable Information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as reasonably practicable.

		<b>HOW WILL I KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY?</b>
		<br>
		If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our Website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use Personally Identifiable Information in a manner significantly different from that stated in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise disclosed to you, at the time it was collected, we will notify you by email, and you will have a choice as to whether or not we use your Personally Identifiable Information in the new manner.  We may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that generally will not affect our use of your Personally Identifiable Information.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should not use our Website.
