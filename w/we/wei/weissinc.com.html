				Our company is committed to preserving your trust and confidence. Because your privacy is important, we have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate this commitment. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website. 
				<br><br>
				<strong>Use of Your IP Address</strong>
				<br><br>
				An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a 32-bit numeric address written as four numbers separated by periods. It is a unique identifier for a computer or device on a network like the Internet. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad information to help us better serve you. 
				<br><br>
				<strong>Cookies</strong>
				<br><br>
				A "cookie" is a small piece of information that is stored by your Internet browser software on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are commonly used to facilitate secure website connections via a unique user name and password, so that you can buy things in the store and access your services that are in password protected areas of the site. On this site, they also facilitate automatic log-in (you can save your own user name and password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit)
				<br><br>
				Cookies are used to authenticate website users and keep track of the user session. They allow us to better analyze our site's traffic patterns and to provide improved content, throughput, advertisements, products and services. They help us to refine and enhance the visitor registration process and add personalization features to customize the site to your needs. 
				<br><br>
				
				Cookies also help identify information that we may need to better serve you should there be any problems with your use of this site. This kind of information may include the web browser you use, the type of computer, the operating system, the Internet service providers, and other similar information. This information is used for various personalization features such as tools in which you can track your own portfolio or be alerted to specific events on your own personalized calendar. We may share this information with our partners, suppliers, and other third parties so that they can better serve you too. 
				<br><br>
				We may sometimes display advertisements on this site from companies outside on our own. These ads may contain their own cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our website, cookies received with electronic ads are collected by these other companies, and we do not have access to this information. Select customer data may be shared with the advertising companies. 
				<br><br>
				<strong>Collection And Use Of Data</strong>
				<br><br>
				Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as name and email address), unique identifiers, and demographic information (such as sex or age). We use this information to enhance the site so that it can offer you a more personalized experience. We also use the information to communicate information about our company, promotional material such as contests, questionnaires and surveys, and promotional material from some of our partners. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by using the tool explained in the "Updating and Removal of Data" section below.  
				<br><br>
				Unique identifiers are collected to verify the user's identity, for use as account numbers in our record system, and for other purposes. Demographic profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the user experience, showing you content that is most likely to be of interest to you, and displaying the content according to your preferences. This information may be shared with our affiliates or third-party service providers such as fulfillment centers, mailing houses, event providers, and customer support organizations.   
				<br><br>
				<strong>Links to Sites Outside Of This One</strong>
				<br><br>
				
				This site contains links to other sites outside of our own network. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. 
				<br><br>
				<strong>Customer Order Information</strong>
				<br><br>
				Our site uses order forms for customers to request information, products and services. Contact information from the order form is used to send orders, communicate information and promotional material from our company and partner companies. Financial information that is collected is used to bill you for products and services ordered. 
				<br><br>
				The security of your information is a paramount concern to us. When you place orders on this site, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, we have implemented industry standard security mechanisms and procedures to protect data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Supplementation Information</strong>
				<br><br>
				This site supplements the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties. For example, your address may be run against the U.S. postal service database in an effort to correct any typographical errors, so that the publications you seek will indeed arrive at the right location.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Updating and Removal of Data</strong> 
				<br><br>
				
				You may have your name removed from our email marketing lists at any time, by visiting the "My Information" section on this website and adjusting your communication preferences. Please read the information in this area very carefully so that you do not inadvertently discontinue the receipt of materials that you actually do wish to receive.
