The information that we collect varies depending upon how you use our Service. When you register as a member of the Site, you will need to provide us with health related information that a trainer will need to design your fitness and nutrition plan.

<p>
	Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. When an individual chooses to post information that will be publicly disclosed, he or she is responsible for ensuring that such information conforms to all local data protection laws.
