<strong>WedDepot.com only asks for specific types of personal information</strong><br>
<br>
In a few areas on our Web site and online customer support tools, we ask you to provide information that will enable us to enhance your site visit, to assist you with technical support issues or to follow up with you after your visit. It is completely optional for you to participate.

</p>
<p>

If we ever ask for significantly different information we will inform you. In the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at any time.</p>
<p><strong>
WedDepot.com only uses your personal information for specific purposes
</strong><br>
<br>

The information you provide will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with WedDepot.com. Among other things, we want to help you quickly find information on WedDepot.com.com and alert you to service upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new products and services from WedDepot.com. Agents or contractors of WedDepot.com who have access to your personal information and prospect information are required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for WedDepot.com. WedDepot.com may enhance or merge your information collected at its site with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you.</p>
<p>
<strong>You can opt-out of receiving further marketing from WedDepot.com at any time</strong><br><br>

Periodically, we may send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. Only WedDepot.com (or agents working on behalf of WedDepot.com and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>
WedDepot.com will not disclose your personal information to any outside organization for its use in marketing without your consent

The online store at WedDepot.com.com is designed to give you options concerning the privacy of your credit card information, name, address, e-mail and any other information you provide us. WedDepot.com is committed to data security with respect to information collected on our site. We offer the industry standard security measures available through your browser called SSL encryption. If at any time you would like to make a purchase, but do not want to provide your credit card information online, you may place an order without credit card information and a representative will contact you. Alternatively, you may always contact a sales representative over the telephone. Simply call 1-866-739-6280. It has always been a WedDepot.com practice to contact customers in the event of a potential problem with your purchase or any normal business communication regarding your purchase.</p>
<p>
<strong>Customized Experience</strong><br><br>

New technologies are emerging on the Internet that help us deliver customized visitor experiences. At WedDepot.com, we primarily use "cookies" to help us determine which service and support information is appropriate to your machine. Our use of this technology does not mean that we automatically know any information about you. We might be able to ascertain what type of computer you are using, but beyond that, our use of cookies is designed only to provide you with a better experience when using www.WedDepot.com. WedDepot.com has no desire or intent to infringe on your privacy while using the WedDepot.com.com site.</p>
<p>
<strong>Third-Party Sites</strong><br><br>

Please be aware that other web sites that may be accessed through our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those third-party web sites linked to WedDepot.com.com are not covered by this privacy statement.

You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. While we strive to protect your personal information, WedDepot.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>
<strong>Children's Privacy</strong><br><br>

WedDepot.com takes children's privacy seriously. WedDepot.com does not seek to collect personal information about children through its Web site. Like other operators of Web sites for children, WedDepot.com is prohibited by law from conditioning a child's participation in an activity disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.

If a child submits information to us through any part of our Web site and we know that the person submitting the information is a child, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties.

Since we do not seek to collect any personal information about children, and we delete such information that we collect inadvertently as soon as we discover that a child has submitted it, we typically retain no information about children that could be reviewed or deleted. In the odd event that a parent requests review or deletion of information about a kid before we have discovered and deleted the information, then we will of course honor that request.</p>
<p>
<strong>Other Web sites</strong><br><br>

WedDepot.com's Web sites contain links to other Web sites that are not operated by WedDepot.com. WedDepot.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of the Web sites that it does not operate. Some parts of the Web site are animated using downloadable applications with Macromedia's Shockwave/Flash.</p>

<strong>Contact WedDepot.com</strong><br><br>
WedDepot.com is the sole operator of the WedDepot.com Web sites. If you would like to contact us for any reason regarding our privacy practices, please call or email us at the following address:</p>
