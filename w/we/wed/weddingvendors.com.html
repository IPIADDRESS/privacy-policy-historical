<h1>Our Commitment To Privacy</h1>

<p>
    Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we
    provide this notice explaining our online information practices
    and the choices you can make about the way your information is

    identifiable information may be requested.
</p>

<h3>Log Files</h3>

    protocol (IP) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service
    Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number
    of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's
    movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP
    addresses, and other such information are not linked to any
    information that is personally identifiable.
</p>

<h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>

<p>
    We use cookies to store information about visitors preferences,
    record user-specific information on which pages the user access or
    visit, customize Web page content based on visitors browser type
    or other information that the visitor sends via their browser.
</p>

<h3>DoubleClick DART Cookie</h3>

<p>
    Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our
    site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to
    our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the
    Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by
    visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">here
    </a>.
</p>

<p>
    Some of our advertising partners, such as Google Adsense, may use
    cookies and web beacons on our site. These third-party ad servers
    or ad networks use such technology to deliver the advertisements
    and links that appear on www.weddingvendors.com sent directly to
    your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this
    occurs.
</p>

<p>
    Other technologies (such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons)
    may also be used by the third-party ad networks to measure the
    effectiveness of their advertisements and/or to personalize the
    advertising content that you see. www.weddingvendors.com has no
    access to or control over these cookies that are used by third-
    party advertisers.
</p>

<p>
    You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-
    party ad servers for more detailed information on their practices
    as well as for instructions about how to opt-out of certain
    practices. www.weddingvendors.com's privacy policy does not apply
    to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other
    advertisers or web sites.

    If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your
    individual browser options. More detailed information about cookie
    management with specific web browsers can be found at the
    browsers' respective websites.
</p>

<h2>The Way We Use Information</h2>

<p>
    We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an
    order only to complete that order. We do not share this
    information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to
    complete that order.
</p>

<p>
    We use the information you provide about someone else when placing
    an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do
    not share this information with outside parties except to the
    extent necessary to complete that order.
</p>

<p>
    We offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product you
    order for another person. Information you provide to us to create
    a gift-card is only used for that purpose, and it is only
    disclosed to the person receiving the gift.
</p>

<p>
    We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such
    addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared
    with outside parties.
</p>

<p>
    We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design
    our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may
    tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain
    area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women
    filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose
    anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable
    information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones
    described above without also providing you an opportunity to
    opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
</p>

<h2>Our Commitment To Data Security</h2>

<p>
    To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure
    the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate
    physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and
    secure the information we collect online.
</p>

<p>
    When placing an order all credit card information is encrypted at all
    stages from your browser to our systems, and no credit card
    information is retained on our web servers.
</p>

<p>
    All emails and newsletters from this site allow you to opt out of
    further mailings.
</p>

<h2>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</h2>

<p>
    You can access all your personally identifiable information that
    we collect online and maintain by logging into your registered
    account. We use this procedure to better safeguard your
    information.
</p>

<p>
    You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable
    information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.
</p>

<p>
    To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable
    steps to verify your identity before granting access or making
    corrections.
</p>
