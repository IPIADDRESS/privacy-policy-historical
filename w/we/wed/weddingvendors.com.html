<h1>Our Commitment To Privacy</h1>

<p>
    Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we
    provide this notice explaining our online information practices
    and the choices you can make about the way your information is
    collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it
    available on our homepage and at every point where personally
    identifiable information may be requested.
</p>

<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
    This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on
    the WeddingVendors.com website. On some pages, you can order products,
    make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of
    personal information collected at these pages are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Address</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Phone number</li>
    <li>Credit/Debit Card Information</li>
    <li>(etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For
    example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to
    the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's address. In
    this circumstance, the types of personal information collected
    are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Address</li>
    <li>Phone number</li>
    <li>(etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Way We Use Information</h2>

<p>
    We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an
    order only to complete that order. We do not share this
    information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to
    complete that order.
</p>

<p>
    We use the information you provide about someone else when placing
    an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do
    not share this information with outside parties except to the
    extent necessary to complete that order.
</p>

<p>
    We offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product you
    order for another person. Information you provide to us to create
    a gift-card is only used for that purpose, and it is only
    disclosed to the person receiving the gift.
</p>

<p>
    We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such
    addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared
    with outside parties.
</p>

<p>
    We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design
    our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may
    tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain
    area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women
    filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose
    anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable
    information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones
    described above without also providing you an opportunity to
    opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
</p>

<h2>Our Commitment To Data Security</h2>

<p>
    To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure
    the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate
    physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and
    secure the information we collect online.
</p>

<p>
    When placing an order all credit card information is encrypted at all
    stages from your browser to our systems, and no credit card
    information is retained on our web servers.
</p>

<p>
    All emails and newsletters from this site allow you to opt out of
    further mailings.
</p>

<h2>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</h2>

<p>
    You can access all your personally identifiable information that
    we collect online and maintain by logging into your registered
    account. We use this procedure to better safeguard your
    information.
</p>

<p>
    You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable
    information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.
</p>

<p>
    To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable
    steps to verify your identity before granting access or making
    corrections.
</p>
