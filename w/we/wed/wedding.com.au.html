The security of your personal information is important to us and we take reasonable steps to protect it from misuse and loss and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Some of the ways we do this are:</p><ol><li> confidentiality agreements for our employees and contractors;</li><li> security measures for systems access;</li><li> only allowing access to personal information where the individual seeking access has satisfied our identification requirements;</li><li> access control;</li><li> destroying or permanently de-identifying your personal information if it is no longer needed for the purpose which the information was originally collected, used or disclosed under National Privacy Policy Principles.</li></ol><p>However, we will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to your personal information.</p><p><strong>Our use of cookies</strong></p><p>Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record keeping purposes. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. However, if you do not wish to receive any cookies, you may set your browser to refuse them. In some instances this may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of parts of this Website.</p><p>The use of cookies can enhance your enjoyment of this Website, because they can help us personalise your experience of this Website by providing information which is most relevant to your interests. Cookies provide us with aggregated information on how users interact on this Website, track which advertisements are effective and help us improve your experience this Website. Cookies do not personally identify you, but your browser.</p><p>We may use independent companies to measure and analyse Internet usage across this Website. The tracking collects the following core information on usage of this Website:</p><ol><li> The number of page views (or page impressions);</li><li> The number of unique visitors;</li><li> How long these unique visitors (on average) spend on the Website;</li><li> Common entry and exit points into the Website.</li></ol><p>This aggregate, non-personal information is collated and provided to us to assist in analysing usage of this Website. The data is also accessible by media organisations and research companies for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with other Internet sites.</p><p>Pages on this Website may be coded with tracking software. This is transparent to the user, as the software makes use of an invisible image (via Javascript) or an invisible Java Applet, at the bottom of the web page. This software stores a cookie in your browser, which contains a unique identifier. This enables tracking of the number of unique visitors to this Website. In no way does this unique identifier identify a user personally. We do not and will not marry any data collected by independent tracking software with any personal information collected on the website.</p><p><strong>Advertisements</strong></p><p>Some advertisements (such as "banner" advertisements) that you see displayed on this Website are delivered on our behalf by third party advertising companies. No personal data, for example your name, address, email address or telephone number are used during the course of serving our advertising, but, on our behalf, our third party advertisers may place or recognise a unique cookie on your browser. This cookie does not collect personal data about you nor is it linked to any personal data about you.</p><p><strong>What happens on links to other websites</strong></p><p>We provide links to websites which are not operated by us. You may be linked to websites which are not operated by us when you click on a URL, hyperlink, an "Apply" button or "More information" link. These linked sites are not under our control and we do not accept responsibility for the conduct of companies linked to this Website. Before disclosing your personal information on any other website, including as part of any application process for a particular product or service, we advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of that website.</p><p><strong>What about information I provide in public areas such as ratings, reviews or forums?</strong></p><p>Any information you post on the Website such as ratings, reviews and posts on bulletin boards and/or posts or communications in chat areas of the Website becomes public information by its nature. While we strive to protect and respect your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose in these areas.</p><p><strong>What else should I know about internet privacy?</strong></p><p>Remember to close your browser when you have finished your user session. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or internet cafe. You as an individual are responsible for the security of and access to your own computer.</p><p>Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information over the internet this information can be collected and used by others. Therefore, if you post personal information in publicly accessible online forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username and passwords and any account information.</p><p><strong>Help us to ensure we hold accurate information</strong></p><p>We take all reasonable precautions to ensure that the personal information we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete and up to date. However, the accuracy of that information depends to a large extent on the information you provide. Therefore, we recommend that you:</p><p>let us know if there are any errors in your personal information; and</p><p>keep us up to date with changes to personal information such as your name or address,</p><p>by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@omg.com.au">privacy@omg.com.au</a></p><p><strong>Resolving Your Privacy Issues</strong></p><p>If you have any issues you wish to raise with us, or would like to discuss any issues about our Privacy Policy, then you are able to do so by emailing us at privacy@omg.com.au. We will endeavour to respond to your request within seven days. If investigation is required we will keep you advised of progress.</p><p><strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong></p><p>We will be adding new pages and features to this Website. We will continuously review our Privacy Policy to ensure that it protects your privacy while supporting your user experience on this Website. We encourage you to keep visiting our Privacy Policy to see if any updates have been made.</p><p><strong>Further information on privacy</strong></p><p>For more information about privacy issues in Australia, visit the Australian Federal Privacy Commissioner’s website (www.privacy.gov.au).</p></div><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="/static/_scripts/thickbox/thickbox.js"></script>
