	<b>Your Privacy Rights</b><p>
</p><h1>WeddingWire Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="smallText">
Updated:&nbsp; October  1, 2007<p>

<strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br>

WeddingWire, Inc. ("Company", "us" or "we") respects the privacy of the visitors to its Web site, WeddingWire.com ("Site"). This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of our policies 
and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information, Automatically Gathered Information"  and "Anonymous Information" (each defined below) you submit to 
us or which we gather when you visit our Site. This Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated in our Terms of Use Agreement, and by registering for a User Account on the Site you 
accept the terms of this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy is effective as of October 1, 2007.
</p><p>
This Privacy Policy applies to ALL users, including those just visiting this Site("Users"). 
</p><p>
"Personal Information" is information about you that is personally identifiable to you, like your name, address, email address or phone number, 
as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.  "Automatically Gathered Information" is information we collect as you visit our site.  
See "Automatically Gathered Information" below for more information.  "Anonymous Information" means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information.  
See "Anonymous Information" below for more information.

<strong>CONSENT</strong><br>
<strong>
By using the Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, and you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy by
 us or by third parties with whom we have a relationship. Your Personal Information may be processed by WeddingWire in the country where it was collected,
as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. 
</strong>
</p><p>

<strong>NOTIFICATION  OF CHANGES</strong><br>
<strong>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as our Services and Site change and expand. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, 
we will post notice that this Privacy Policy has changed in the MyHome and MyDashboard (Vendors) area of the Site. 
Unless otherwise provided, the revised terms will take effect when they are posted. Once any changes that we make to this Privacy Policy become effective, 
your continued use of the Site after such time will signify your acceptance of the new terms. </strong>
  
</p><p>
<strong>INFORMATION WE GATHER</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Registration</strong><br>
If you register with the Site , we collect and store Personal Information that specifically identifies you or the account you set up with Wedding Wire (your "Account"). 
At this time, the most information you would be required to submit is your first name, last name, User ID, password, preferred currency, street address, city, state, zip/postal code, 
country, phone number, email address and valid financial account (ie. credit card) information. Other information requested on our Registration page is optional. 
We may, in the future, include other optional requests for information from you to help us tailor the Site for you and deliver personalized information to you. 
We may supplement Personal Information you provide us with additional information purchased from third parties for marketing purposes.  In addition, 
if you add a vendor to your planning tools, or provide a review of a new vendor, we will automatically add that vendor's information to our catalog (without any link back to you). 
</p><p>
<strong>Password</strong><br>
Use of portions of the Site requires you to establish a User ID and password.  You agree that you will be responsible for maintaining your password as confidential and for 
any activity that occurs on your Account as a result of your sharing your password with another or failing to protect it. WeddingWire is not responsible for any loss or 
damage arising from your failure to maintain the confidentiality of your password. 
</p><p>
<strong>Online Surveys and Contests </strong><br>
Occasionally, WeddingWire may conduct User surveys to collect information about our Users’ preferences. These surveys are optional, and if you choose to respond, your 
responses will be kept anonymous. These surveys may be conducted by and processed through third parties. Similarly, we may offer contests to qualifying Users in which 
we ask for contact and demographic information such as name, email address and mailing address. Except with respect to any survey partners, none of the survey results are 
shared with third parties in a personally identifiable form. The demographic information that WeddingWire collects in the registration process and through surveys 
may be used to help us improve our Services and Site to meet the needs and preferences of our Users. This may include targeting advertising to you about our 
Services and Site. Information we gather through a contest may also be disclosed to third parties as necessary for prize fulfillment and other aspects of any c
ontest or similar offering. 
</p><p>
<strong>SmartMatch™ Program</strong><br>
In order to participate in the SmartMatch™ program, you must create a Profile and agree to the terms and conditions of the SmartMatch™program.  
As a Wedding Vendor, Engaged Couples may review your Profile to help them decide whether to accept your bid for business.  
Wedding Vendors will review the request for service information submitted by Engaged Couples in order to consider submitting and creating a bid for business. 
</p><p>
<strong>Automatically Gathered Information</strong><br>
WeddingWire automatically collects browser type and browser software version to tailor the presentation of the Site and the Services to the User's 
platform and to maintain a record of the User's activity on the Site. WeddingWire uses cookies to enable Users to specify unique preferences and to track User trends and patterns. 
Users always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. If you disable cookies on your browser, please note that some parts of our 
Site may not function as effectively or may be considerably slower. As an automatic process, our Web server software records a log file of IP addresses that access the Site. 
We also collect IP address information but do not ordinarily link IP addresses to Users' Personal Information. 
However, we can and will use IP addresses to identify a User when we, in our sole discretion, determine that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our 
<a href="/shared/TermsOfUse">Terms of Use</a>, Privacy Policy, or to protect our service, Site, customers, vendors, or others. 
</p><p>
<strong>Email to Friends Feature and Referral Program</strong><br>
WeddingWire lets you easily connect your Profiles to friends/affiliates via email. WeddingWire also offers the ability to send friends/affiliates emails to WeddingWire. 
If you choose to use either feature, we will use your email address to copy you on the message or to send on the email your behalf, and you hereby grant permission for such use. 
</p><p>
<strong>Public Information</strong><br>
As part of registration, you may set up a Profile describing yourself, your wedding (MyProfile) or your business (Storefront). This profile will be publicly available as a 
default. You will have the ability to hide Personal Information under your Profile Settings. WeddingWire will not have any obligation under this Privacy Policy with 
respect to information in your Profile or information you voluntarily provide to other Users via the Site. 
</p><p>
<strong>HOW  WE USE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION</strong><br>
</p><p>
<strong>Registration Information</strong><br>
We use Personal Information for our own internal purposes, including contacting you via email to inform you about updates to our Services and providing you with 
information relating to e-commerce transactions that you conduct on the Site. We reserve the right to disclose your information as required by law. 
We do not rent or sell our individual Users' Personal Information to third parties. We do, however, provide you with the opportunity to receive newsletters via email. 
If you decide to opt in to receive newsletters, you may opt out of receiving these newsletters at any time. We also reserve the right to transfer your 
Personal Information as part of a transfer of all or part of WeddingWire's assets to a buyer, as described in "Acquisition," below.
</p><p>
<strong>The SmartMatch™ Program</strong><br>
This area of the Site is for the benefit of Users to match service/product requests with service/product vendors. 
The information  shared between Engaged Couples and Wedding Vendors is not used for any purpose other than to facilitate communication and the exchange of 
information between the parties involved. WeddingWire reserves the right to monitor communications in order to verify compliance with our Privacy Policy, 
Terms of Use, international, federal or state laws and/or our other stated policies.  Once bids are submitted and one is accepted, we will disclose personal contact 
information to the Engaged Couple and the Wedding Vendor whose bid is accepted so that the parties can complete the transaction.
</p><p>
<strong>The WeddingWire Community</strong><br>
This area of the Site is for the benefit of Users. It is a public discussion and communication forum whereby content (best practices, suggestions, etc.) 
is generated by the WeddingWire Community. By your participation to this area of the Site, you acknowledge that the information posted will reside 
in the public domain and will be publicly available. From time to time WeddingWire Staff may examine this content or other user behavior to confirm that the 
terms of service are not being breached and WeddingWire may remove any content that is inappropriate in WeddingWire's sole discretion.  We strongly recommend that you 
refrain from posting in Personal Information in this forum, and you may not post the Personal Information of any other person on the forum.  
See our <a href="/shared/TermsOfUse">Terms of Use</a> for more information.
</p><p>
<strong>The WeddingWire Reviews System</strong><br> 
The WeddingWire Vendor Review system represents a central repository for ratings and reviews of wedding vendors by their customers (engaged couples or married couples). 
When you submit a review or a counter-review on the WeddingWire Site, your WeddingWire Profile information will be made available as part of the review posting. 
If you provide a review for a vendor that is not yet part of our catalog, or if you add a new vendor to your planning tools, we will use the information that you 
provide about the vendor to notify the vendor that a review has been completed and that we are adding the vendor to our catalog.  We will also seek that vendor's 
greater involvement with our Site.  Your Personal Information will NOT be made available or public as part of the Vendor Review Program. 
You may choose to list your profile under a unique WeddingWire Screenname. 
</p><p>
<strong>The WeddingWire Listing</strong><br> 
The WeddingWire Listing provides a listing by sortable category/fields of participating WeddingWire Vendors as well as a listing of local businesses. 
If a WeddingWire Vendor is registered, the vendor's Profile will be made available on the Listing unless the vendor chooses to unregister from the Site. 
</p><p>
<strong>Advertising</strong><br> 
We may send you email communications including information that we think may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving these email communications either 
when you register to become a Member or via the Preferences section of your MyAccounts or MyProfiles area. We do not send any of your Personal Information to our advertisers. 
You may see a cookie from a third-party banner server.  This cookie comes from the third-party banner server, not WeddingWire. Again, we do not pass along any Personal 
Information to this party. 
</p><p>
<strong>Co-Branded or Partnered Services</strong><br> 
WeddingWire may enter into co-branding or partnering relationships with third-party Web sites and companies to provide products and Services to our Users or to such third parties' users.
  WeddingWire may share your Personal Information, including User ID and password, with certain co-branded third-party service or product providers as required to 
  provide a specific product or service that you request from a co-branded page or co-branded site. However, these third-party partners may not use this 
  Personal Information for any reason other than to provide the service or product that the User has explicitly signed up for.
</p><p>
If you join WeddingWire through a co-branded or partnered site (e.g. on a co-branded Registration page), it is WeddingWire’s general policy not to 
share anything other than summarized or aggregated data with the partner; however, any Personal Information you provide on the co-branded Site may also 
be received by the co-brand partner that operates the co-branded site and could be stored and used by the co-brand partner according to its privacy policy. 
Please take the time to review these third-party privacy policies. WeddingWire is not liable to you for any use of your Personal Information by a co-brand partner. 
</p><p>
<strong>WeddingWire's Contractors</strong><br> 
To the extent necessary to provide you with the Services on the Site, we may provide your Personal Information to third party contractors who work on behalf of or with 
WeddingWire to provide you with such Services, to help us communicate with you or to maintain the Site. However, these contractors do not have any independent right
 to share your Personal Information. 
</p><p>
<strong>Other Members</strong><br> 
As part of our SmartMatch™ program, we share the email addresses of Wedding Vendors and Engaged Couples with each other once a project is awarded to
 enable the Wedding Vendor and Engaged Couple to formalize their relationship and for work on the project to be completed. In addition, 
 Users involved in a transaction may request full contact information of the other party, including name, company name, phone number and mailing address. 
 If you request the contact information of another User as part of the project transaction, your contact information will also be released to that User. 
 You agree not to use the disclosed information of other Users for any purpose other than providing the applicable Services or resolving a dispute.  
</p><p>

<strong>Legal Requests</strong><br> 
WeddingWire cooperates with all law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud, theft, 
harassment and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to 
(a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; (b) protect or defend the rights or property of WeddingWire or third parties; or 
(c) assist in any investigation. 
</p><p>
<strong>Affiliates</strong><br> 
Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures or other companies under a common control (collectively, "Affiliates"), 
we may in the future. We may share some or all of your Personal Information with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. 
</p><p>
<strong>Acquisition</strong><br> 
If our company or our assets related to the Site are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the
 rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. 
</p><p>
<strong>Anonymous Information</strong><br> 
We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as names) that makes the information personally identifiable to you. 
We may use this Anonymous Information to analyze inquiry, request and usage patterns so that we may enhance Services and the Site. We reserve the right to use and disclose 
Anonymous Information to third parties in our discretion. "Anonymous Information" means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; 
Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons. 
</p><p>
<strong>Comments Submitted by Users</strong><br> 
WeddingWire constantly seeks to improve the quality of the services we provide and the User experience on the Site. We value your input and encourage you to help us expand 
and make improvements to the Site by providing us with any thoughts or comments you might have regarding our services or the operation of the Site. 
You can submit any comments you have to us by clicking on the link "Suggestions" at the bottom of most of the pages on the Site. The "Suggestions" page will already 
contain your login information due to the sign-in process. We will only use your login information to acknowledge or respond to your comments. 
Submitting comments via the "Suggestions" page will not cause you to receive any secondary or promotional material, unless specifically requested by you.  
All ideas, suggestions comments and proposals you send to WeddingWire (collectively, "Submissions") are non-confidential and shall become the sole property of WeddingWire.  
WeddingWire shall own all rights therein, including all intellectual property rights. WeddingWire shall be entitled to use and/or disseminate the Submissions in any 
manner and for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation or credit to you.  
We will not identify you as the source of a suggestion or comment without your consent.
</p><p>
<strong>SECURITY</strong><br> 
We will use commercially reasonable methods to keep Personal Information securely in our files and systems. Our Payment System is operated using secure 
Internet connections, using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, to help protect your financial data. Please note that with current technology, 
we cannot guarantee the security of your data as it travels over the Internet. 
</p><p>
