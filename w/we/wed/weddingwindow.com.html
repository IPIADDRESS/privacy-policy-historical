If you register for or use such services, both Wedding Window and the other company may receive information collected as part of the co-branded services. If so, the privacy policy of such other company shall apply to their use of this information.</p>

As part of a transaction, we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.</p>
<p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Such companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>
<p>We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on Wedding Window; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Wedding Window (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Wedding Window services or members of the public.</p>
