          <p><b>Privacy Policy</b></p>
          <p><font style="font-size:16px" color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Your 
            privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on 
            the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you 
            to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities 
            with complete confidence. <br>
            <br>
            We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment 
            to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company 
            collects information from all end users of our Internet services (the 
            "Services")-those who access some of our Services but do 
            not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who may 
            purchase Products and/or pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to 
            the Service ("Members")-what we do with the information 
            we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the 
            collection and use of such information. We request that you read this 
            Privacy Policy carefully. <br>
            <br>
            Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used<br>
            <br>
            Introduction. Our company collects information in different ways from 
            Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services 
            and the network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use 
            this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you 
            use our Products and Services, and generally, do not share this information 
            with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information 
            collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very 
            special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure 
            is required by law or other special cases described below. <br>
            <br>
            Registration: Members may be asked to provide certain personal information 
            when they sign up for our Products or Services including name, address, 
            telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), 
            and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. 
            The personal information collected from Members during the registration 
            process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing 
            purposes). This information is not shared with third parties, unless 
            specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. <br>
            <br>
            However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote 
            our Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information, 
            such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed 
            to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose 
            of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner 
            for any other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate 
            profiles from personal information Members provide during registration 
            (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained 
            in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying 
            information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services. <br>
            <br>
            Our Company Partners and Sponsors: Some products and services may 
            be offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, 
            independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide 
            Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner 
            may need to collect and maintain personal information. In these instances, 
            you will be notified before any such data is collected or transferred 
            and may decide not to use that particular service or feature. <br>
            <br>
            Additionally, our partners may have advertisements or co-branded Web 
            Pages that are cosponsored by an affiliate, independent contractor 
            seller, or non-affiliated partner. Our company may share non-identifying 
            and aggregate information (except as described above), but not personal 
            information, with such partners in order to administer the co-branded 
            products or services offered. <br>
            <br>
            Online Shopping: At some Web sites, you can purchase products and 
            services or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog 
            or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked 
            to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email 
            address, phone number, and credit/debit card information. <br>
            <br>
            If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift 
            order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information 
            about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone 
            number. Our company has no control over the third parties' use of 
            any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please 
            exercise care when doing so. <br>
            <br>
            If you order services or products directly from our company we will 
            use the personal information you provide only to process that order. 
            We do not share this information with outside parties except to the 
            extent necessary to complete that order. <br>
            <br>
            Online Advertisements: Our company may display our online advertisements. 
            In those cases we share aggregated and non-identifying information 
            about our Visitors and Members collected through the registration 
            process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these 
            advertisers. <br>
            <br>
            Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying 
            information to deliver tailored advertisements or joint ventures. 
            For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us the 
            audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored 
            to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information 
            we have collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to 
            the intended audience. Our company does not share personal information 
            about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers or joint venture 
            companies.<br>
            <br>
            Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email 
            inquiries to our company, the return email address is used to answer 
            the email inquiry we receive. Our company does not use the return 
            email address for any other purpose and does not share the return 
            email address with any third party. <br>
            <br>
            Voluntary Customer Surveys: We may periodically conduct both business 
            and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate 
            in these surveys because they provide us with important information 
            that helps us to improve the types of products and services we offer 
            and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses 
            will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted 
            by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We may take the information we receive from individuals responding 
            to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses 
            of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses 
            to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, 
            education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). 
            We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our 
            services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, 
            non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.<br>
            <br>
            Special Cases: It is our company's policy not to use or share the 
            personal information about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to 
            the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity 
            to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. <br>
            <br>
            However, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, 
            or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible 
            through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we 
            believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: credit agencies, 
            collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, 
            or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy 
            Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or 
            legal requests for such information; to disclose information that 
            is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone 
            who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, 
            or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect 
            our company and our Members. <br>
            <br>
            "Cookies" and How Our Company Uses Them. A "cookie" 
            is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you 
            visit certain Web sites. Our company may use cookies to collect, store, 
            and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve 
            the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications 
            networks. <br>
            <br>
            If you are a Visitor or Member we may use a cookie to save your settings 
            and to provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies 
            do not enable third parties to access any of your customer information. 
            Additionally, be aware that if you visit other Web sites where you 
            are prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may be required 
            to accept cookies. <br>
            <br>
            Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not 
            control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility 
            for information collected through them. <br>
            <br>
            Our Company Commitment to Children's Privacy. Protecting children's 
            privacy is especially important to us. It is our policy to comply

            other applicable laws. Therefore we restrict our Web site to persons
