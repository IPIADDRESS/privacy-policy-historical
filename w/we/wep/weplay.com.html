  <p><em>(Last updated: January 8, 2008)</em></p>

  <p><a href="http://www.weplay.com">http://www.weplay.com/</a> (“weplay”) has 
  created this privacy policy (the “<strong>Policy</strong>”) so you will understand 
  when and how personal information is collected, used, disclosed and 
  protected with respect to your use of our Web site (“<strong>Site</strong>”) 
  located at <a href="http://www.weplay.com/">http://www.weplay.com/</a>. By using the Site or the services available 
  through the Site (the “Service”), you consent to the privacy practices 
  described in this Policy. This Site is owned and operated by weplay, Inc.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to change this 
  Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to our Policy, we 
  will post a new policy on our Site and update the “last updated” 
  date set forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check our Policy 
  whenever you use the Service to see if it has been updated since your 
  last visit.</p>
  <p>For information on our privacy policy regarding children under the age
  of 13, please refer to our <a href="/t/kids">Kids Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h3>INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</h3>
  
  <p>We collect two basic types of information 
  with our Service, namely personal information and aggregate information.  
  As used herein, the term “personal information” means information 
  that specifically identifies an individual (such as a first and last 
  name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or other 
  account number), and demographic and other information about an individual 
  when directly linked to personally identifiable information. A user 
  name may be personal information if it includes personally identifying 
  information such as a first and last name.</p>
  <p>Our definition of personal information 
  does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information 
  is data we collect about a group or category of services or users from 
  which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, 
  information on how you use our Service may be collected and combined 
  with information about how others use the Service, but no personal information 
  will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps us understand 
  trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features 
  or otherwise tailor our Service. This policy in no way restricts or 
  limits our collection and use of aggregate information, and we may share 
  aggregate information about our users with third parties for various 
  purposes, including to help us better understand and improve our Service, 
  and for advertising and marketing purposes.</p>

  <p>Those are the types of personal and 
  other information we collect. You should refer to the rest of this Policy 
  to see how we use, disclose and protect this information:</p>

  <h4>Information You Give Us.</h4>
  <p>We collect information you give us 
  at various times when you register with us and use our Service. Examples 
  include the following:</p>

  <h4>Registration and Transaction Information.</h4>
  <p>When you register to use the Service, we may collect various kinds of 
  contact information about you including, for example, your name, e-mail 
  address, birth date, country of residence, and zip code. We may also 
  collect demographic information that you provide to us. You will also 
  be asked to create a user-chosen ID and password for your use when accessing 
  the Service. Finally, you will be asked to choose a secret question 
  and answer for purposes of password retrieval. </p>

  <h4>Use of Services and Interactive Areas of Site.</h4>
  <p>Personal information may also be collected 
  if you provide such information in connection with participating in 
  interactive areas on the Site or using the Service. For example, you 
  may submit for posting on the Site images that could reasonably 
  be used to identify you, and written statements and descriptions that 
  could be used to identify you. Several categories of this information 
  are optional, and you will have the ability to edit or remove much of 
  this information at any given time. </p>

  <h4>Submissions and Customer Service. </h4>
  <p>From time-to-time we may post surveys, contests or sweepstakes on our 
  Service, which may request personal or demographic information and customer 
  feedback. Participation in these requests is completely voluntary and 
  with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to participate 
  and disclose information. We may also collect personal information if 
  you provide it via e-mail, message boards, or other interactive services. 
  Please do not post any information that you expect to keep private. 
  In addition, we may collect and retain information that identifies you 
  personally when you send us comments, questions or suggestions. </p>

  <h4>Automatically Collected Information.</h4>
  <p>We automatically receive certain types 
  of information whenever you interact with us. For example, when you 
  use the Service, our systems may automatically collect your IP address 
  and the type of operating system or browser you use. We may also collect 
  information pertaining to your account activity, information pertaining 
  to the files accessed or used by you, transactional information, and 
  standard access information, such as the time and date of accessing 
  the Service, and usage of the Service. We use such information to help 
  manage the effectiveness of our online advertising and to gather access 
  information, such as counting the users who have visited those pages 
  and compiling aggregated statistics about Service usage. We may also 
  correlate this information with personal information through the use 
  of backend analytical tools.</p>

  <h4>Cookies.  </h4>
  <p>We may also use cookie technology to collect information. Among other 
  things, the use of cookies enables us to improve our Site by seeing 
  which areas and features are most popular; to count the number of computers 
  accessing the Site; to personalize the Site and improve the Site experience; 
  to record your preferences and track the ads you view; to track your 
  transactional information; and to allow you to visit the Site without 
  re-entering your member ID and/or password. A cookie is a small amount 
  of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent 
  to your browser from a Web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s 
  hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default 
  setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you 
  before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser 
  options. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a 
  user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site and the Service may 
  not function properly. For example, you may not be able to sign in and 
  may not be able to access certain Site features or services.</p>

  <h4>Web beacons.  </h4>
  <p>“Web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, single-pixel 
  GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, 1-by-1 GIFs, and Web bugs) are tiny 
  graphic files placed on a Web page which send a signal when a user has 
  visited that page, allowing the site to collect standard access information, 
  such as time and date of a page view, and a description of the page 
  on which the Web beacon resides. We use Web beacons to help manage the 
  effectiveness of our online advertising and to gather access information, 
  such as counting the users who have visited those pages and compiling 
  aggregated statistics about site usage.  </p>

  <h4>Information about Children Under 
  13.</h4>
  <p>We recognize the need to provide additional 
  privacy protections for children who visit our sites. To read about 
  our protections for children who are under the age of 13, please see 
  weplay’s Kids Privacy Policy <a href="http://www.weplay.com/t/kids">http://www.weplay.com/t/kids</a>.</p>

  <h3>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
  
  <h4>Internal Use of Personal Information.</h4>
  <p>In general, we use personal information 
  internally to process your requests or transactions, to provide you 
  with information or services you request, to inform you about other 
  information, events, promotions, products or services we think will 
  be of interest to you, to facilitate your use of, and our administration 
  and operation of, the Site and to otherwise serve our users and enable 
  them to take maximum advantage of our Service. For example, personal 
  information may be used: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>to request feedback and 
    to enable us to develop, customize and improve the Site and our publications, 
    products and services;</li>
    <li>to conduct marketing analysis, 
    to send you surveys or newsletters, to contact you about our or a third 
    party’s services, products, activities, special events or offers and 
    for other marketing, informational, product development and promotional 
    purposes;</li>
    <li>to provide products or services 
    or complete transactions you have requested and to process payments 
    in connection therewith; </li>

    <li>to send you a welcoming 
    email and to contact you about your use of the Site, to respond to your 
    emails, submissions, comments, requests or complaints, to perform after-sales 
    services, to anticipate and resolve problems with our Service, to respond 
    to customer support inquiries, for assistance with our product and service 
    development, and to create and inform you of new products and services 
    from weplay that better meet your needs; </li>
    <li>to generate a customer profile 
    for you and to select specific advertisements for you to view; </li>
    <li>to notify contest winners; 
    and </li>
    <li>for the specific purpose 
    for which the information was provided.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please note that we may use your personal 
  information in correlation with information collected by one of our 
  partners or advertisers. Also, as mentioned above, we may correlate 
  your personal information with automatically collected information through 
  the use of backend analytical tools.</p>

  <p>You should review the following section 
  to understand when weplay discloses personal information to non-affiliated 
  third parties.</p>

  <h4>Disclosure of Personal Information 
  to Third Parties.</h4>
  <p>We do not rent, sell, or share personal 
  information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies 
  except (i) when we have your permission, (ii) to third party service 
  providers who need access to such information to carry out their work 
  for us., (iii) as part of a business transfer, or (iv) when required 
  by law or permitted to protect our rights, property, or safety. The 
  following section describes these disclosure circumstances more fully.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent.</strong> Unless you 
    give us your consent, we will not disclose your personal information 
    to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. With your consent, 
    we may disclose your personal information to third parties so that they 
    may provide you with products and services that you have requested. </li>
    <li><strong>Service Providers. </strong>
    We may share personal information with third party vendors, consultants, 
    and other service providers who assist us in operating and managing 
    the Site, the Service or our business and who need access to such information 
    to carry out their work for us. For example, we may share your personal 
    information with companies who are fulfilling orders, processing payment 
    or other information, or administering surveys on our behalf. We may 
    also share personal information with service providers who are performing 
    internal analysis of the Site on our behalf, such as to estimate our 
    audience size, measure aggregate traffic patterns as well as to understand 
    demographic, customer interest, and other trends among our users. In 
    some cases, the Service Provider may be directly collecting the information 
    from you on our behalf. In the event that we use third party vendors 
    to assist us in performing these functions, the third parties may not 
    use or disclose your personal information for any other purpose. </li>

    <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> 
    Information about our users and the Service is one of our most important 
    business assets. Therefore, information about our users, including personal 
    information, may be disclosed and transferred as part of any merger 
    or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide the Service 
    or fulfill products, sale or pledge of company assets as well as in 
    the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal 
    information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the 
    company. </li>
    <li><strong>Protection of 
    weplay and Others.</strong> We may release personal information in the good 
    faith belief that release is appropriate and necessary to comply with 
    legal process or authority (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court 
    order); to enforce or apply our policies; to initiate, render, bill, 
    and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our rights, property, 
    or personal safety of weplay, our users, our employees, or the public; 
    or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger 
    of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure 
    of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay. 
    We will notify you before disclosing your information for purposes of 
    responding to legal process.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>THIRD PARTY SITES</h3>
  <p>Please be aware that we may provide 
  links to third party Web sites as a service to our users and we are 
  not responsible for the content or information collection practices 
  of those sites. Please also note that these Web sites’ privacy policies 
  will differ from those of weplay. Therefore, we encourage you to review 
  and understand their privacy practices before providing them with information 
  or visiting their sites.</p>

  <h3>NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY; DATA STORAGE</h3>

  <p>Reasonable effort will be taken to 
  prevent unauthorized release, corruption, or loss of your personal and 
  project data. For example, we limit which teams at weplay have access 
  to your personally identifiable information. </p>
  <p>Personal information submitted by you 
  is stored and maintained in our database and may be archived elsewhere. 
  Our records are stored indefinitely, as are our archival backup copies.  
  weplay generates automatic backups of all system data. These backups 
  are transferred using commercially reasonable efforts such as secure 
  technology, and are stored on systems that are only accessible by authorized 
  employees of weplay and our third-party vendors and partners. We also 
  use encryption for processing sensitive information.  While we 
  have taken efforts to guard your personal information, we cannot guarantee 
  that your information will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental 
  circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.</p>
  <p>Your account information and access 
  to our Service is accessible only through the use of an individual user 
  ID and password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, 
  you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any 
  other person. You are responsible for all uses of our Site and Service 
  by any person using your account user ID and password. Please advise 
  us immediately if you believe your account user ID and password have 
  been misused.</p>
  <p>If weplay learns of a security systems 
  breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you 
  can take appropriate protective steps. weplay may also post a notice 
  on the Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, 
  you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in 
  writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach, you 
  should notify us at <a class="" href="mailto:privacy@weplay.com">privacy@weplay.com</a>.</p>

  <h3>ACCESS AND CONTROL OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

  <p>If you are a registered user of our 
  Service, you may view, correct, and delete your personal information, 
  or remove your profile entirely from our database, simply by logging 
  into the Service and editing your profile, or by contacting our customer 
  support. Generally, you should be careful when making any personal information 
  available to the public.</p>
  <p>Users may “opt in” or “opt out” 
  to receive marketing or promotional communications or solicitations 
  from weplay on our behalf on behalf of third parties. Users may also 
  “opt in” or “opt out” of receiving communications directly from 
  third parties. However, this shall not affect our ability to send you 
  service and account related emails or to use your personal information 
  as otherwise described in this Policy.</p>

  <h3>INTERNATIONAL USERS</h3>

  <p>By using our Site and providing us 
  with data, you acknowledge and agree that due to the international dimension 
  of weplay, we may use the data collected in the course of our relationship 
  for the purposes identified in this policy or in our other communications 
  with you, including the transmission of information outside your resident 
  jurisdiction. Please note that your personal information will be stored
