Google will use this information on behalf of the website operator for the purpose of evaluating the use of the website by the users, compiling reports on the website activity and providing other services relating to the website activity and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address which your browser transmits in the framework of Google Analytics will not be associated with any other Google data. You may prevent the storage of the cookies by using a particular browser setting. Please note however that in this case you may not be able to fully use all the functions of our websites. Users may prevent the collection of the data generated by the cookie and related to their use of our websites (including their IP address) and its processing by Google by downloading and installing a Browser-Plugin which is available [here](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de).\n\nYou can object to the use of cookies.

If and when a standard is established and accepted, we may revisit our policy on responding to these signals.\n\nCalifornia residents who are registered members or users of the Services and are under the age of 18 may be entitled under California law to request and obtain removal of content and information that they themselves post on the Services.  You may request such removal by emailing us at privacy@wework.com.  In your request, please provide a description of the material that you want removed and information sufficient to permit us to locate the material, including your name, email address, year of birth, mailing address (including city, state, and zip code) and the subject line “California Removal Request.”  Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the material.  For example, materials that you have posted may be republished or reposted by another user or third party.\n\n## Collection of Information From Children\n\nThe Services are not directed to children under the age of 16 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 16.

</ul>
<h2>Sharing of Personal Information</h2>
<p class="pWithSpacing__privacyPolicy__7dvyW">We disclose your personal information in the following circumstances to the following parties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Among WeWork companies</strong>.  Our services are provided by affiliates of WeWork Companies Inc. depending on where you are located and the services you use.  WeWork shares personal information with those affiliates for the purposes mentioned above.  These affiliates use your information in accordance with this policy.</li>
<li><strong>Our Community</strong>.   Our Services include online and offline member communities, forums and networks that allow you to share and connect with others.  We make this possible for WeWork members by creating a profile for new members that contains your name and the name of your company or other organization.  This profile is created automatically and is accessible to other members of the forum or network, some of which include all WeWork members.  You can supplement your profile by adding additional information about yourself and your company or organization and by posting content and comments and you may be able to share your profile with a broader audience.</li>
<li><strong>Service Providers</strong>.  We rely on third-party service providers to perform a variety of services on our behalf. For example, we may rely on service providers to host data and platforms, fulfill our product and service requests and answer your questions, send e-mails on our behalf, process payment card or other transactions, and analyze data to improve our products and services.</li>
<li><strong>Other Parties When Required by Law and as Necessary to Provide and Protect Our Services</strong>.  There may be instances when we disclose your information to other parties:
<ul>
<li>to provide you with the services you or your company or organization request, such as a disclosure of your information to a landlord in connection with a lease agreement, or to auditors or consultants;</li>
<li>to comply with the law or respond to legal process or a request for cooperation by a government entity or law enforcement;</li>
<li>to detect, suppress, and prevent fraud or verify and enforce compliance with the policies governing our Services; or</li>
<li>to protect our rights, property, and safety or that of any of our respective affiliates, business partners, customers or employees and where otherwise required by law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Other Parties in Connection with a Corporate Transaction</strong>.  We will disclose your personal information to an acquiror in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of a business or assets to that third party, such as in connection with a merger or in the event of a bankruptcy reorganization or liquidation.</li>
<li><strong>Third-Party Partners, With Your Consent</strong>.  We may request your consent to share personal information about you with third parties so that they may provide you with special offers, promotional materials, and other materials that may be of interest to you.</li>
<li><strong>Other Parties at Your Company’s or Organization’s Direction</strong>.  In addition to the disclosures described in this Policy, we may share information about you with third parties when your company or organization requests such sharing.

If you or your company or organization requests to participate, we may share your information with the relevant third party in connection with the requested product or service.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregated and Non-Personal Information</strong>.  We also share with third parties information in a manner that does not identify particular individuals, for example, information that has been aggregated with other records.</li>
</ul>
<p class="pWithSpacing__privacyPolicy__7dvyW">Our Services contain links to other sites that we do not own or operate.  We provide links to these third-party sites as a convenience to our members.  They are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked services.  The linked services are subject to their separate and independent privacy statements, notices, and terms, which we recommend you read carefully.  The collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third party and not this Policy.</p>
<h2>Third Parties That Provide Content or Functionality on Our Services</h2>
<p class="pWithSpacing__privacyPolicy__7dvyW">We also partner with certain third parties to collect, analyze, and use some of the personal information described in this Policy.  For example:</p>

<h2>Information Security</h2>
<p class="pWithSpacing__privacyPolicy__7dvyW">We have in place various procedures to safeguard your information.  Although we take such steps to protect your information, no security program is foolproof and thus we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal or other information.</p>

<p class="pWithSpacing__privacyPolicy__7dvyW">Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites and other online services with which a user communicates.

If and when a standard is established and accepted, we may revisit our policy on responding to these signals.</p>
<p class="pWithSpacing__privacyPolicy__7dvyW">California residents who are registered members or users of the Services and are under the age of 18 may be entitled under California law to request and obtain removal of content and information that they themselves post on the Services.

In your request, please provide a description of the material that you want removed and information sufficient to permit us to locate the material, including your name, email address, year of birth, mailing address (including city, state, and zip code) and the subject line “California Removal Request.”  Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the material.  For example, materials that you have posted may be republished or reposted by another user or third party.</p>

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Policy at any time.  We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to ensure that you are aware of our current privacy practices, although we may also elect to notify you by e-mail or by posting something on some or all of our online Services.
