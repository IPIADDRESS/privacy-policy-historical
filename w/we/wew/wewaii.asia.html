<h1>Travian Games GmbH Privacy Policy</h1>
  
  <p>This is the Privacy Policy of Travian Games GmbH, Wilhelm-Wagenfeld-Str. 22, 80807 München, Germany (hereinafter referred to as TRAVIAN). It applies to all Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN.</p>
  <p>TRAVIAN shall handle all personal data which the user submits during his contractual relations strictly confidential and shall adhere to all relevant data protection regulations. Details can be taken from this Privacy Policy. </p>
 <p> The Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN may provide links to websites owned or operated by third parties or otherwise direct the user to websites owned or operated by third parties (each, a “Linked Website”).  The use of any Linked Website will be governed by terms of use, privacy policies and other additional terms, notices and policies set forth or referenced in any such Linked Website.  To understand how a Linked Website and the owners or operators of a Linked Website will collect, use, store and otherwise make available a user’s Personal Information, the user should review the Linked Website’s privacy policy; none of these activities is governed by this privacy policy, and TRAVIAN shall not be responsible for the use of any Personal Information by or through any Linked Website. </p>
  
  <h1>Which personal data is collected, used and stored by TRAVIAN?</h1>
  <p>TRAVIAN collects, uses and stores such personal data which the user voluntarily submits to TRAVIAN by electronic or other means of communication (e.g. in standard forms or otherwise on the Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN). </p>
  <p>This includes data which the user states vis-à-vis other users when communicating with them in the Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN. 
  In order to register for the use of the games operated by TRAVIAN or in order to purchase a Premium Membership, the user has to provide TRAVIAN with certain personal information, including the user’s Email address. Upon the purchase of a  Premium Membership, the user is obliged to provide TRAVIAN with additional personal information, such as postal address, bank account and/or credit card information. </p>
 <p> The user is recommended to handle his data carefully and sparingly and to consider thoroughly what and with whom he would like to communicate in the Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN. Certain information, e.g. communication between users, is visible for other users of the Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN. </p>
  
  <h1>Here are some examples for data stored by TRAVIAN:</h1>
  <p>When a user accesses or uses the Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN, TRAVIAN automatically collects and stores the following types of non-personally identifiable information (information that is compiled in anonymous and aggregate form and is not used to locate, contact, or identify you specifically) in addition to the Personal Information the user provides voluntarily: information from server logs found on the browser, information regarding the volume and status of data transmission, click-through statistics, IP address, the type of application (e.g. web browser) used to access the Websites and the games operated by TRAVIAN, the type of operating system used, the name of the domain and host from which the user accesses the Internet, the date and time the user accesses portions of the Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN, and the Internet address of the site from which the user linked directly to the Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN.  </p>
  <p>TRAVIAN stores the Email address provided by the user. TRAVIAN shall be entitled to use this Email address  to inform the user of innovations and newsletters. The user can object to this at any time and request deletion of his data from the mailing list in written form (e.g. via Email). The user will not be charged for such request, but he will have to pay for the costs of transmitting such request (at basic tariffs). The user will be informed about his right to object and he will be given the right to transmit his objection in each information and in each newsletter sent by TRAVIAN. </p>
  
  <h1>What does TRAVIAN do with user data?</h1> 
  <p>TRAVIAN will use the information automatically collected through the user’s access and use of the Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN to help determine how the Websites and games are utilized and to help improve the Websites and games. For example, the information will allow: (i) to determine which pages are the most popular with users, (ii) to determine if the Websites and games are working properly or if the Websites and games are being used improperly, and (iii) to improve the user experience on the Website. </p>

 <p> TRAVIAN will collect and store protocols which reflect how the Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN are used, e.g. in-game user activity, in-game communication between users or communication within game related services. These protocols include the monitoring of gaming patterns and inspections regarding possible manipulations of the games operated by TRAVIAN. Therefore, these protocols can be used to detect and disclose improper and unduly user activity. TRAVIAN uses specific programs in order to detect infringements of the rules of the games, e.g. programs which can detect the use of unauthorized scripts and which can store the IP-addresses as well as further data which the browser transfers as header information. In case that TRAVIAN notices that a user acts in breach of his contractual obligations, e.g. by using unauthorized scripts, TRAVIAN expressly reserves its rights to merge the IP-address of the respective user with other data which is already stored regarding that user, in order to make the user aware of his breach of contractual obligations. TRAVIAN may institute further measures against the respective user in order to restore regular gaming services. </p>

  <p>For purposes of handling of payments, TRAVIAN shall be entitled to transfer user data to external service providers assigned with the collection of the remuneration, in as far as this is necessary for the determination of the remuneration and settlement of accounts with the user. TRAVIAN shall further be entitled to transfer user data to such thirds parties to whom TRAVIAN has assigned its claims against the user, in as far as this is necessary for the collection of the assigned claims. TRAVIAN shall inform the user of the names of such third parties. If TRAVIAN cooperates with third parties in order to render its services, it shall commit such third party to adhere to the effective data protection regulations and to provide for adequate data protection. </p>

  <p>TRAVIAN may aggregate and use certain non-personally identifiable information for research, advertising or marketing purposes and may share, sell and rent or trade that information and statistical data derived from that information with advertisers, vendors, customers or other third parties for research or marketing purposes. The aforementioned utilization of data is carried out anonymously and TRAVIAN does not use automatically collected information to identify a particular user. TRAVIAN informs the user that such information is not Personal Information and is therefore not subject to the privacy restrictions of this Privacy Policy. If and as far as TRAVIAN uses personal data to create user profiles, TRAVIAN shall not transfer such profiles without the prior consent of the user and shall immediately stop such utilization of user profiles if the user objects to such use of his data. </p>

  <p>TRAVIAN may possibly enable third parties to contact the user for advertising purposes. As long as the user does not object, his user data may also be used for sending him advertisements which reflect his interests (based on the information he has submitted to TRAVIAN and on his actions within the games and Websites operated by TRAVIAN).</p>
   <h1>Changes to or Deletion of Personal Data</h1>
  <p>The user may make changes to his personal data at any time (e.g. in order to update or correct such data) or delete his personal data completely. If the user would like TRAVIAN to change his personal data or stop using his data, the user may contact TRAVIAN  at support@travian.de. TRAVIAN will then make the required changes or delete the user data as quickly as possible. TRAVIAN points out that due to technical or organizational reasons some measures may still be carried out after the user has submitted his request for deletion, if such measures were already initiated but not accomplished by that time. </p>
  
  <h1>Information as to personal data</h1>
  <p>The user shall be entitled to request free of charge information on the content and extent of his stored personal data through a corresponding written notice to TRAVIAN. This information will usually be provided electronically, normally via Email.</p>
  
  <p>TRAVIAN may change this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting updated versions of the Privacy Policy.  TRAVIAN suggests to review this Privacy Policy from time to time. Personal Information which TRAVIAN collects will be treated in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy in effect (as posted) at the time that the Personal Information is collected.  TRAVIAN will inform the user in case that TRAVIAN intends to extend the use of personal data. </p>
  
  <h1>Glossary</h1>
  <p>In order to provide for a better understanding of this Privacy Policy, the most important terms are explained hereinafter:</p>
  
  <p><strong>What is considered personal data?</strong>
  Personal data means personally identifiable and recognizable information about an individual person, as defined under applicable privacy laws, and may include his or her name, physical address, email address,  telephone number and credit card information. </p>
  
  <p><strong>What is considered user data?</strong>
  User data means data which is collected, used and stored by TRAVIAN when a user contacts the Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN. User data is information which can be used to identify the user (e.g. the name of the domain and/or IP-address from which the user contacts TRAVIAN), the date and time the user accesses the Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN, the scope of use of the Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN, as well as information about the sites the user accessed on the Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN.</p>
  
 <p> <strong>What is an IP-address?</strong>
  IP-addresses serve to identify each computer which is connected to the Internet. Each computer which is connected to the Internet can be allocated to a specific IP-address, i.e. to a certain numerical combination. </p>
  
 <p> <strong>What are Cookies?</strong>
  “Cookies” are small text files that a website sends to a user’s hard drive through the browser.  TRAVIAN uses Cookies to collect information about a user’s visits and to enhance the user’s experience when visiting the Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN.  For example, TRAVIAN uses Cookies to, among other things, identify previous visitors to the Website, identify a user as he or she moves through the Website, track user visits and account set-ups, determine what set-ups are most frequently requested, and save the user password so that the user does not have to provide it each time he or she visits the Website.  Storing information about visits to the Website will allow TRAVIAN to, on occasion, customize pages for the user. <br>

  By themselves, Cookies do not reveal a user’s Email address or other Personal Information. TRAVIAN does not use Cookies to collect, track, or store Personal Information.  The TRAVIAN Cookies will never be used to track a user’s activity on any third-party websites or to send spam.  It is possible to configure the browser to accept all Cookies, reject all Cookies or notify the user when a Cookie is received.   It is also possible to reject, delete or otherwise disable Cookies at any time.  Doing so, however, may inhibit the user experience on the Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN and the user may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings on the Websites and games operated by TRAVIAN.  For example, if the user disables or disallows Cookies, some multimedia images and graphics may not display properly, the user may not be able to view customizable features or the user may have more difficulty navigating through the Website.</p>
