			<p>Western Digital  Corporation, Western Digital Technologies, Inc. (“WDT”), and&nbsp; Arkeia Software, Inc. (collectively, "we" or  "us") are committed to protecting the privacy of customers,  especially those who access and use our websites.</p>
<p>This Website Privacy Policy (“Policy”) governs your use of our websites,  which include <a href="http://www.wdc.com">www.wdc.com</a>, <a href="http://www.arkeia.com">www.arkeia.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.westerndigital.com">www.westerndigital.com</a> (collectively,  the “Site”). <strong>&nbsp;This Policy may change from time to time, so please check  back periodically.</strong></p>
<p>This  Policy does not apply to user information that we collect in connection with  our products and software applications, which are governed by our Products  Privacy Policy, available here:&nbsp;<a href="" onclick="$('#tabsprivacy').tabs('select',1);return false;">

<u>Products Privacy Policy</u></a>.&nbsp; In addition,  this Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or  control, or to individuals whom we do not employ or manage, including any of  the third parties to whom we may disclose user information as set forth in this  Policy.</p>
<p class="bodytextbold">What information do we collect from you?</p>
			<p>Our Site collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with efficient and effective service while using our Site.</p>
			<p>Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to  information that specifically identifies who you are. We request Personally  Identifiable Information when you order a product or service, register a  product, fill out surveys, create a user account for the WD Community or  correspond with us. This information might include your name, mailing address,  telephone number or e-mail address. This might also include your credit card number  and card security code (also called CVV) and the expiration date, if you create  a return materials authorization (RMA), purchase an extended warranty or  purchase products through WD’s customer loyalty program. We transmit your  entire credit card information to the appropriate credit card company in an  encrypted format during order processing for payment processing. If you  purchase products through the WD on-line store, please note that the on-line  store's privacy policy may differ from this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information: This  refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual.  We gather this information each time you access our Site. This information,  compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis, may include  the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the web site you visited just  prior to accessing our Site, the URL you go to after leaving our Site, what  browser you are using, platform type, your internet service provider, your  Internet Protocol ("IP") address, date/time stamp, and number of  clicks to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user’s movement in the  aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. You do  not have to register with us before we can collect this anonymous information.  A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide  Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission  Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the  World Wide Web. </p>
<p>Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based  on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number  that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the  Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers  require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse  and shop.</p>
<p>The Site may contain “cookies.” Cookies are bits of  electronic information generated by web servers and stored on your hard drive  when you visit practically any website on the Internet. Cookies are often used  to differentiate users, store user preferences and track user trends in  general. We may use cookies to improve the quality of the Site and to better  understand how users interact with the Site. We do not use cookies to retrieve  individual personally identifying information about you from your computer  unless you knowingly and willingly provide such information. You can adjust  your web browser security settings to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a  cookie is being sent. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web  browser, some features of the Site we offer may not function properly.</p>
<p><b>How do we use the information that we receive from you?</b></p>
			<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information from our  customers and other visitors to our Site is to provide those customers and  visitors with a superior customized online experience. We use customer contact  information to provide faster, more effective warranty service, to contact  prior purchasers and inform them of the status of their online orders or  returns, to send promotional e-mails about products and services that may be of  interest to them, and to contact users in relation to their user accounts and  use of the WD Community.
            </p><p>We may also perform statistical analyses of aggregate  customer behavior. For instance, we may analyze which pages on our Site receive  the most visitors or how long visitors spend reviewing those pages when  visiting the Site. This allows us to measure relative customer interest in the  various areas of our Site. We then use that information to improve the content  of our Site, to enhance your experience when visiting the Site, to customize  the content and/or layout of the Site's pages, to provide the services required  by our individual customers, to comply with any requirements of law; to serve,  or have a third party serve specialized or relevant advertising content and/or  recommendations to you on the Site; and for our internal purposes. We may from  time to time supply the owners or operators of third party sites from which it  is possible to link to the Site with information relating to the number of users  linking to the Site from their sites. You cannot be identified from this  information.</p>
<p><b>With whom do we share your information?</b></p>
			<p>Except in the situations described in the following  paragraph, we do not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third  parties. You should also consult the privacy policy of our on-line store, which  is managed by one of the firms with whom we do business. The on-line store's  privacy policy may differ from this privacy policy.</p>
          <p>From time to time, we may be required by law enforcement or  judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to  appropriate governmental authorities or other third parties in conjunction with  a judicial, administrative or other proceeding. We will disclose Personally Identifiable  Information upon receipt of a valid court order or subpoena or in order to  assist a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement  agencies in identifying those who use our Site's services for illegal  activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any  activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.</p>
<p><strong>Children’s Privacy </strong></p>
<p>The Site complies with the Children’s Online Privacy  Protection Act and all other applicable laws and regulations protecting  children’s privacy on the Internet. The Site is not directed to children under  the age of 18 and we do not allow persons under 18 years of age to create user  accounts. Therefore, except as may be required by law, the Site does not  knowingly collect, maintain, or disclose any personal information from children  under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not: (i) access  or use the Site, (ii) create or attempt to create an account on the Site, (iii)  sign up for any subscription service, or (iv) buy anything through the Site.</p>
<p>As a parent or guardian you can request that WD remove  personal information of your child that was submitted without your consent or  by the child misrepresenting his or her age. At your request, we will take  reasonable steps to remove such information from our database. All such  requests should include the same user name, password, and e-mail address that  your child submitted and should be sent to <a href="mailto:webinfo@wdc.com">webinfo@wdc.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Information collected by third-party analytics  companies</strong></p>
<p>We may work with  third-party data  analytics providers and products to obtain, compile and analyze information  about how users are using and interacting with WDT Products.&nbsp; For example, these analytics providers may  record the device, operating system, firmware and unique ID of WDT Products;  generalized location information; and usage information, such as how frequently  WDT Products are used and the file extensions that are accessed using WDT software  applications.&nbsp; You recognize and agree  that the analytics companies utilized by WDT may combine the information that  they collect with other information they have independently collected from  other services or products used by you. These companies collect and use  information under their own privacy policies.&nbsp;  You further recognize and agree that WDT has no responsibility for the  technologies, tools, or practices of the third parties that provide analytics  products and services to WDT.&nbsp; For a  current list of third party analytic tools we are using, as well as a link to  these providers’ privacy policies, please see <a href="thirdparty.aspx"><strong>third party analytics details</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Information collected by third-party content  providers</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Certain  WDT Products offer the ability to access third-party  content from companies such as Netflix, YouTube and Pandora.&nbsp; WDT Products may also enable you to access or  use third-party cloud services from companies such as Dropbox and Microsoft.&nbsp; These third-parties may collect and transmit  information about you and your use of their services, including information  that can be used to identify you personally.&nbsp;  WDT does not control and is not responsible for the collection practices  of these third-party content providers.&nbsp;  Your decision to use their services is entirely voluntary.&nbsp; You should ensure that you are comfortable  with how these third-party services use and share your information by reviewing  their privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy settings directly on those  third-party services’ websites prior before electing to use their services.</p>

<p>We have  implemented reasonable security measures and practices in an effort to protect  the confidentiality of your User Provided Information.&nbsp; However, no security system is  impenetrable.&nbsp; It may be possible for  third parties to intercept or access information that you provide to WDT.&nbsp; WDT cannot guarantee the security of your  User Provided Information, nor can we guarantee that information you supply  will not be intercepted while being transmitted to WDT.&nbsp; It is important for you to protect against  unauthorized access to your password(s), computer and WDT Products.</p>
