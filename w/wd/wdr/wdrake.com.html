			Whenever you shop with Walter Drake, online or through our catalogs, we collect the information necessary to process your transaction. This may include item, quantity ordered, name, address, city, state, zip code, telephone number, e-mail address, and billing information (credit card or check account number, expiration date and billing address).

We cannot identify you individually from your screen name if you are using America Online or one of the other major online services. Our server also identifies your browser, your browser version, the operating system you are using, the pages you visit in The Walter Drake Store and the uniform resource locator (URL) of where you were on the Internet if you clicked a link to www.wdrake.com. </p>
