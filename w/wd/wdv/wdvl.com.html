<h3><br>
<strong>NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Non-Personal Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>"<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>" is any information that does not
reveal your specific identity, such as: </p>
<ul>

<li> Browser information</li>
<li>
Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies</li>
<li>
Demographic information and other information provided by you</li>
<li>
Aggregated information</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<strong>How We Collect Non-Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>We and our third party service providers may collect Non-Personal Information
from you, including your MAC address, your computer type, screen resolution,
OS version, Internet browser, as well as demographic data, for example, your
location, educational degree, balance on mortgage, value of real estate,
income, age, weight, type of insurance, diabetic or smoking-related statistics.
We also aggregate Personal Information in a manner such that the end-product
does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example,
by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who
have a particular telephone area code. We may also collect Non-Personal Information
through the use of cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other similar technologies
for example to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status or to
measure the effectiveness of e-mail communications. If you do not want information
collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most
browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. To delete any local
shared objects, please visit <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html#117717"><strong>http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html#117717</strong></a>.
To learn more about cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/"><strong>http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong>How We Use and Disclose Non-Personal Information </strong></p> <p> Because
Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use and
disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose. In some instances, we
may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining
your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Non-Personal
Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated
by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>
<h3><strong>IP ADDRESSES</strong></h3>
<p>Your "<strong>IP Address"</strong> is a number that is automatically
assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider
(ISP). </p>
<p><strong>How We Log IP Addresses </strong></p>
<p>An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files
whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the
page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on
the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites. </p>
<p><strong>How We Use and Disclose IP Addresses? </strong></p>

<p>We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels,
helping diagnose server problems, geographic mapping and administering the
Site. We may also use and disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for
which we use and disclose Personal Information. Please note that we treat
IP Addresses, server log files and related information as Non-Personal Information,
except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. </p>
<h3><strong>THIRD PARTY SITES</strong></h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the
privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any
third party operating any site to which this Site contains a link. The inclusion
of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us
or by our affiliates. </p>
