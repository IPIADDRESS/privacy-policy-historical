      <p>We may partner with third-party service providers to serve ads regarding  goods or services that may be of interest to you when you access and use the  Site and third party-sites. &nbsp;Some of the  ads on this Site or on third party sites may be personalized, meaning that they  are intended to be relevant to you based on what we or the online advertising  network serving the ad know about you or your computer's browsing activity on  both the Site and third-party sites. &nbsp;To  do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser  (including through the use of pixel tags).&nbsp; <br>

        <br>
        These opt-out mechanisms rely on cookies to remember your choices.&nbsp; If you delete your cookies, use another  computer or device, or change browsers, you will need to repeat this process. &nbsp;In addition, opting out of interest-based ads  will not opt you out of all ads, but rather only those ads that are  personalized to your interests. </p>

      <p><strong>Information collected by third-party analytics  companies</strong></p>
      <p>We may work with  third-party data  analytics providers and products to obtain, compile and analyze information  about how users are using and interacting with WDT Products.&nbsp; For example, these analytics providers may  record the device, operating system, firmware and unique ID of WDT Products;  generalized location information; and usage information, such as how frequently  WDT Products are used and the file extensions that are accessed using WDT software  applications.&nbsp; You recognize and agree  that the analytics companies utilized by WDT may combine the information that  they collect with other information they have independently collected from  other services or products used by you. These companies collect and use  information under their own privacy policies.&nbsp;  You further recognize and agree that WDT has no responsibility for the  technologies, tools, or practices of the third parties that provide analytics  products and services to WDT.&nbsp; For a  current list of third party analytic tools we are using, as well as a link to  these providers’ privacy policies, please see <a href="thirdparty.aspx"><strong>third party analytics details</strong></a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Information collected by third-party content  providers</strong><strong> </strong></p>
      <p>Certain  WDT Products offer the ability to access third-party  content from companies such as Netflix, YouTube and Pandora.&nbsp; WDT Products may also enable you to access or  use third-party cloud services from companies such as Dropbox and Microsoft.&nbsp; These third-parties may collect and transmit  information about you and your use of their services, including information  that can be used to identify you personally.&nbsp;  WDT does not control and is not responsible for the collection practices  of these third-party content providers.&nbsp;  Your decision to use their services is entirely voluntary.&nbsp; You should ensure that you are comfortable  with how these third-party services use and share your information by reviewing  their privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy settings directly on those  third-party services’ websites prior before electing to use their services.</p>
      <p><strong>How do we  protect your information?</strong></p>
      <p>If you would  like us to correct or delete User Provided Data that you have provided to us in connection with  your use of a WDT Product, please contact  us at <a href="mailto:webinfo@wdc.com">webinfo@wdc.com</a>, and we will respond in a reasonable  time. &nbsp;We will make a good faith effort to provide  you with access to your User Provided Data and to correct any inaccuracy or  delete such information, at your request, if it is not otherwise required to be  retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. &nbsp;We may decline to process requests that are  unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical  effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical or  for which access is not otherwise required. </p>
      <p>We have  implemented reasonable security measures and practices in an effort to protect  the confidentiality of your User Provided Information.&nbsp; However, no security system is  impenetrable.&nbsp; It may be possible for  third parties to intercept or access information that you provide to WDT.&nbsp; WDT cannot guarantee the security of your  User Provided Information, nor can we guarantee that information you supply  will not be intercepted while being transmitted to WDT.&nbsp; It is important for you to protect against  unauthorized access to your password(s), computer and WDT Products.</p>
      <p><strong>Children</strong></p>
      <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from, or market to, children under the age of 13. &nbsp;If a parent or guardian  becomes aware that his or her child has  provided us with information without  his or her consent, he or she should contact  us at <a href="mailto:webinfo@wdc.com">webinfo@wdc.com</a>.  &nbsp;We will take  all reasonable steps to delete such information from our database within a  reasonable time. </p>
      <p><strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br>
        WDT  retains the discretion to amend or modify this WDP Privacy Policy from time to  time.&nbsp; We will notify you about  significant changes in the way we treat User Provided Information by sending  you a direct communication or by posting a clear and prominent announcement on our  website.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
