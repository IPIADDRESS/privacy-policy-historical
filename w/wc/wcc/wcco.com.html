</p><p>
<b><a name="ask">Does Channel 4000 ask for personal information?</a></b>
</p><p>
Yes, we do. Channel 4000 may ask for your name, e-mail address, and other personal information when you sign up for our services such as <a href="http://talk.ibsys.com/cgi-bin/webx.cgi?towntalk"><b>Town Talk</b></a>, our discusssion area. We also ask for such information whenever you enter sweepstakes or other promotions sponsored by Channel 4000 and/or our many partners.
</p><hr size="0">
<b><a name="how">How does <b>Channel 4000</b> use my personal information?</a></b><a name="how">
<p>
This site does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals.
</p><p>
<b>Channel 4000</b> may share your personally identifiable information with other companies with which it conducts business. For example, if you enter our contests, make a purchase, or use our e-mail services, we sometimes rely on outside companies to provide these services to you. In such cases, we need to provide your personally identifiable information to them.
</p><p>
While <b>Channel 4000</b> will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it was provided, <b>Channel 4000</b> does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of any third parties.
</p><p>
Channel 4000 will not disclose any of your personal information, except as described below, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights or property of Channel 4000. Channel 4000 does disclose personal information in some limited circumstances, but this is specifically described to you when we collect the information
</p><p>
Also, Channel 4000 does disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users are female) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
</p></a><p><a name="how">
<b>Except for purposes outlined above, we do not provide, sell or lease your personally identifiable information to any third parties, unless otherwise stated at the time of collection. If you have any questions or concerns regarding what is done with your information on any part of <b>Channel 4000</b>, please e-mail us at <b></b></b></a><b><b><a href="MAILTO:&quot;c4k@Channel4000.com&quot;">c4k@Channel4000.com</a></b>, <i>before</i> submitting any information.</b>
</p><p>
</p><hr size="0">

<i>Channel 4000 Marketplace</i>
<br>
If you place an order in Channel 4000's Marketplace, we will collect personal information including your credit card number and shipping information. This information will only be used to fulfill your order and will not be shared with anyone outside of Channel 4000. Telephone numbers and e-mail addresses will only be used to contact you regarding your order should the need arise.
<p>
</p><hr size="0">
<p>
We also collect anonymous, aggregated data and provide it to our advertisers and other companies that we do business with for market research and statistical purposes. For example, we might report to our advertisers that a certain percentage of users are between the ages of 30-35.
</p><hr size="0">
<b><a name="use">Will Channel 4000 use my information for direct mailings?</a></b>
<p>
We will never send any unsolicted mail to our users; we have specific areas where our users can register to receive e-mail updates, and we will immediately remove any user from that mailing if they ask. 
</p><p>
Finally, you should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., first and last name, address, e-mail address, etc.) on the forums or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.
</p><hr size="0">
<b><a name="kids">What about kids?</a></b>
<p>
Naturally, the safety of children is very important to us. Kids should always ask parents for permission before sending personal information to Channel 4000, or to anyone online for that matter. Parents, please keep in mind that the personal information we gather from children under the age of 16 is used for editorial and feedback purposes, or for any purposes specifically described when the information is collected. 
</p><p>
<b>CHILDREN:</b> Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself (your name, address, e-mail address, etc.) to us or anyone else over the Internet, and before making any purchases online.
</p><p>
<b>PARENTS:</b> We encourage you to get involved with your childrenâ€™s online activities and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. Any personally identifiable information collected by <b>Channel 4000</b> from children (that we are aware are children) will be used only for <b>Channel 4000</b> internal purposes such as market research, sweepstakes fulfillment, and for fulfilling requests for information or materials, and may sometimes be included in our database. However, such information will not be posted or published by us, or provided to any third parties, without your prior consent. Additionally, anonymous aggregated data is sometimes provided to other companies with which we do business, for statistical and market research purposes as described above. Finally, you should be aware that if your child voluntarily discloses his name, e-mail address, etc. on various forums or chat areas, such disclosure may result in unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, you should discourage your child from doing so.

<B><A NAME="cookies">Does Channel 4000 use cookies"?</A></B>
<P>
First things first: We are AVID defenders of your privacy. The cookies and any information that we ever collect about you -- or any of Channel 4000's users -- will NEVER leave this company. It will not be sold in a list, it will not be disclosed in a report. The information is for internal use -- and only ONE internal use -- counting total users.
<P>
It is true that cookies can be used to seriously infringe on personal privacy by tracking an incoming visitors tastes by what they click on. However, our only interest in providing your browser with a cookie is so we know that you are a unique user of Channel 4000 and our total user base is increased by 1. Without this cookie information we are unable to tell, for example, whether the incoming traffic coming from a computer is one browser or ten employees each with their own browser on the company's only Internet-accessible computer.
<P>
In our experience, traffic measurement without cookies leads to a dramatic underestimation of the number of users coming to our site. In fact, once we implemented counting users we realized that almost double the number of people enjoyed our site as we had previously thought. Using cookies is the most accurate tool for us to be able to gauge how many people use our site, not individually but rather in terms of "total numbers". To this end our statistics package (as you have noticed) is VERY aggressive in giving out cookies - one for every HTTP transaction, 1 for every .html page, 1 for each graphic, 1 for each .cgi until it gets a cookie into that browser. Since the homepage of Channel 4000 has several graphics on it plus the 1 .html page you are going to see all kinds of cookie requests if you keep refusing to accept.
<P>
Here is the makeup of a Channel 4000 cookie:
<P>
<PRE>

 INTERSE=          204.221.45.113     536853162594985
   |                         \          \
   |                          \          \
   |               The IP your computer   \
The name of the   used on its first visit  \
statistics package                          \
we use.                     A random number that
                         marks your browser as ONE
                          unique software visitor
</PRE>
<P>
This is all we know about you, this is all we will ever know about you, once you accept a cookie from Channel 4000 you will never be asked to accept another one . . . even if your computer's address changes we just want you to count as <B>one</B> visitor.

<P>
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Furthermore, while we strive to protect your personal information, Channel 4000 cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. In addition, our partners and third party Internet sites and services accessible through Channel 4000 or parties whom we inform you are collecting data in connection with sweepstakes, promotions, etc., have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. Channel 4000 has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions.
<P>
The point? You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
