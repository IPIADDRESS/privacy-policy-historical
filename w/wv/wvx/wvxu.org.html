<p>CINCINNATI PUBLIC RADIO uses shared lists to maximize the benefits it can provide through other non-profit arts organizations and through qualified associations. If you are a member and allow it, your name and physical address may be exchanged for consideration with other local non-profit organizations for one-time mailing use only to promote a product or service that they offer.

Phone numbers, email addresses and giving histories are never shared.</p>
<p>CINCINNATI PUBLIC RADIO will not share, exchange, rent, or sell any of its lists to for-profit organizations, political parties or candidates for political office.</p>
<p>If you do not want your name and physical address to be used in this way, you may indicate this at the time you provide the information.
