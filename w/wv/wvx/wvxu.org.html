<p>You have come to this page from a website or digital service produced by Cincinnati Public Radio (CPR). We recognize the importance of privacy to visitors to any CPR website, and we want you to know how we collect and use information about you when you visit our websites. This privacy policy explains what type of information is collected from you when you visit this and other CPR websites, and how we may use that information. </p>

<p><a name="1"></a><b>Information we automatically gather when you visit CPR websites</b><br>
  We record data for each visitor who accesses our sites using Google Analytics. This allows us to make our sites more useful to our visitors. The data recorded does not contain a visitor's name, address, phone number, credit card numbers, or any other personally identifying information. Rather, these log files may contain some or all of the following information:                 
</p><ul>
  <li>The date of the visit                     
  </li><li>The time and length of the visit                       
  </li><li>The path taken through the website                        
  </li><li>The browser being used                          
  </li><li>A list of files downloaded or viewed                             
  </li><li>The amount of time spent listening to audio files                             
  </li><li>The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine accessing our website*                             
  </li><li>Any errors encountered                          
  </li></ul>
<p>*Most Internet Service Providers use a "dynamic" form of assigning IP Addresses. This means that a visitor may have a different IP address each time he or she visits a website. Also, many Internet Service Providers use "proxy servers," which provide even more anonymity for visitors.</p>
<p>We use this information to aid the technical administration of the sites and to better understand how each site is functioning for its users. This information may be correlated with your profile, if you have provided this data, to provide special "personalized" services. This information may also be used in aggregate form. </p>
<p>We may track your visit to sections of our websites in order for some site features to function properly for you. In some instances, "cookies" or a similar technology may be used to update your registration records with session information. If you do not wish to accept a cookie from CPR's servers, you can adjust the settings on your browser accordingly. Refusing to accept cookies from the CPR server may result in some limits on the benefits that we can automatically provide as you enjoy the CPR websites.</p>
<p><a name="2"></a><b>Information you give us </b><br>
  CPR does not collect personally identifying information from CPR websites unless you choose to provide that information to us. You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age to submit any User Materials or personally-identifying information; participate in any online contests; and/or place an order on the Online Store. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may browse the CPR Digital Services or register for email newsletters or other features of the CPR Digital Services with the consent of your parent(s) or guardian(s), so long as you do not submit any User Materials. If you are under 13 years of age, please do not send any information about yourself, including your name, address or email address. If we discover that we have collected any personally-identifying information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information from our database as soon as possible. </p>
<p><a name="3"></a><b>Name and contact information</b><br>
  CPR may ask visitors (you) to provide certain personal information when you: register for access to audio streaming; register for a contest; sign up for an e-mail list; request information; purchase products or services; contribute material that may be used on the website; participate in a discussion board or chat; or use a CPR form to become a member of CPR. You will also have the opportunity to request future e-mail contact from CPR regarding its programs and websites. CPR tells you whether a specific piece of information is required at the time it is requested. </p>
<p>This information may be used by CPR to: verify your identity; manage CPR's members and donors; manage a contest; gather your editorial comments and feedback; contact you for additional information or administrative purposes; provide attribution for any submitted content of yours published by CPR, and fulfill your order or request. CPR will contact you only if necessary for the purposes above.</p>
<p>CPR uses shared lists to maximize the benefits it can provide through other non-profit arts organizations and through qualified associations. If you are a member and allow it, your name and address may be exchanged for consideration with other local non-profit organizations. These organizations may attempt to contact you to promote a product or service that they offer. Such contacts from other local non-profits will only be made with CPR's consent, and CPR will only grant its consent when CPR considers the offer to be of potential interest and benefit to our members. Phone numbers, email addresses and giving histories are never shared.</p>
<p>CPR will not share, exchange, rent, or sell any of its lists to political parties or candidates for political office.</p>
<p>If you do not want your name and contact information to be used in this way, you may indicate this at the time you provide the information. If you decide after you have provided this information that you do not want CPR to share your information with any company or organization, you may also notify us by e-mailing <a href="mailto:memberservices@cinradio.org">memberservices@cinradio.org</a>. CPR cannot remove your name from any third party's list; you will have to contact them directly. </p>
<p>The Direct Marketing Association (DMA) offers a Mail Preference Service that is designed to assist consumers in decreasing the amount of nonprofit or commercial mail they receive at home. For more information about this service, visit the DMA website at: <a href="http://www.the-dma.org" target="_blank">www.the-dma.org</a> and click on "Consumer Help". </p>
<p><a name="4"></a><b>Demographic and profile information</b><br>
  CPR occasionally conducts online surveys, sometimes in association with a contest or other offer. These surveys may ask you for demographic information such as ZIP code, age, education, or income level. This information is used in an aggregate form to help us understand our audiences and improve our services. Demographic and profile information may be shared with selected third-party organizations, only on an aggregate basis, to describe the nature of our online audiences.</p>
<p><strong><a name="data_security"></a>Commitment to Data Security<br>
  </strong>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, CPR has in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. </p>
<p><a name="5"></a><b>Credit card information </b><br>
  You must be 18 or over to engage in money-related transactions on a CPR site. When you do so, you will be asked for a credit card number. All financial transactions take place only on secure servers, and electronic communication of credit-card information is sent only in a secured or encrypted format. Your credit card information is not saved on internal systems. This information is not made available to any third party and is considered completely confidential. The CPR website does not store credit card information for the purpose of "personalizing" the website.</p>
<p><a name="6"></a><b>Special note for CPR members</b><br>
  If you use CPR 's secure online form to become a member or make a contribution to CPR, your name, complete contact information, and all contributions is only accessible by members of the CPR Membership Department. Your membership information will be protected in full compliance with the CPR Member Lists Policy.</p>
