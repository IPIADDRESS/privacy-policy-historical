Our website uses a simple algorithm and automated calculations to perform this task, in order to provide an immediate figure on your reply rate. </li>

You see your matches in general, matches online, new matches and updated matches in exact accordance with your own preferences (as per personal settings) which are fed into the system. The system then compares your and preferences to the corresponding settings and preferences in the opposite sex (i.e. male to female and female to male). </li>

If you fulfill the given criteria (e.g. required number of days you remain with a flawless profile on the website, the minimum number of posts, comments, likes (i.e. upvotes) required, you are awarded the corresponding medal automatically by the system). You are free to choose the display of any or all these medals. There are two exceptions to this: the medal for site helper and site consultant require interaction with our staff and are hence awarded by human decision making and not on basis of an automised decision-making process. </li>

That also and especially includes the restriction of your possibilities to interact with other users, members or subscribers on the website and likewise limits your options to make use of our services. Upon receiving any complaint, however, the system also immediately and instantly reports this to our management and members of staff who are committed to taking action within a 24h time frame. Complaints, thus, constitute a semi-automised decision-making process, as there is human surveillance and intervention at the end of the action chain. </li>
