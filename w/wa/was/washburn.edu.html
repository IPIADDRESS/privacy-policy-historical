  <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">It is the practice of Washburn 
    University to respect the privacy of all Web site visitors to the extent permitted 
    by law. This Web privacy statement is intended to inform you of the ways in 
    which this Web site collects information, how the information is used and 
    what we do to protect any information you choose to provide us. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2">There are four types of information that may be collected 
    during your visit: network traffic information, Web server statistic logs, 
    cookies, and information voluntarily provided by you. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Network Traffic </p>
  <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">In the course of ensuring 
    network security and consistent service for all users, the University may 
    use software programs to do such things as:</span></p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Analyze network traffic </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Identify unauthorized access</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Detect computer viruses and other 
      software that might damage University computers or the network </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Monitor and maintain the performance 
      of the University network<br>
      <br>
      </span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2">In the course of such monitoring, these programs may detect 
    such information as e-mail headers, addresses from network packets and other 
    information. Information from these activities is used solely for the purpose 
    of maintaining the security and performance of the University's networks and 
    computer systems. Personally identifiable information from these activities 
    is not released to external parties unless required by law.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333">Web Server 
    Logs</span></b> <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

    </span></b><br>
    <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

    Web site and returned to the Web site on request. This site may use cookies 
    for two purposes: to carry data about your current session at the site from 
    one Web page to the next, and to identify you to the site between visits. 
    If you prefer not to receive cookies, you may turn them off in your browser, 
    or may set your browser to ask you before accepting a new cookie. Some pages 
    may not function properly if the cookies are turned off. Unless otherwise 
    notified on this site, we will not store data, other than for these two purposes, 
    in cookies. Cookies remain on your computer. We do not forward them to any 
    external parties. Unless otherwise notified on this site, we do not use cookies

    with other entities. </span></p>
  <p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333">Information

  <p class="MsoBodyText2">In the course of using this Web site, you may choose to 
    provide us with information to help us serve your needs. For example, you 
    may send us electronic mail (through a Web form or mailto: link) to request 
    information, send an electronic postcard, register for events, or you may 
    send us your address so we may send you an application or other materials. 
    Any personally identifiable information you send us will be used only for 
    the purpose indicated. Requests for information will be directed to the appropriate 
    staff to respond to the request, and may be recorded to help us update our 
    site to better respond to similar requests. We will not sell, exchange or 
    otherwise distribute your personally identifiable information without your 
    consent, except to the extent required by law. We do not retain the information 
    longer than necessary for normal operations. Each Web page requesting information 
    discloses the purpose of that information. Please contact the person listed

    links to other World Wide Web sites or resources. We do not control these 
    sites and resources, do not endorse them, and are not responsible for their 
    availability, content, or delivery of services. In particular, external sites 
    are not bound by the University's Web privacy policy; they may have their 
    own policies or none at all. You can tell if you are leaving a University 
    Web site by noting the URL of the destination site. </span></p>
