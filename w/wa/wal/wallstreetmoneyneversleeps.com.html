<li><b>INTRODUCTION</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment LLC (“Fox” or “we”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications (“apps”), and widgets (collectively, the “Fox Services”). By using Fox Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. A list of our affiliated companies (“Company Affiliates”) is available at <a href="http://www.21cf.com ">www.21cf.com</a>.</p>
<p>As set forth in our <a href="https://www.foxconnect.com/terms_of_use">Terms of Use</a>, the Fox Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the Fox Services without being registered with or subscribing to a Fox Service and those who have registered with [or subscribed to] a Fox Service. This Privacy Policy applies to Fox’s collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally Fox’s practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><b>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Fox and our service providers collect the following information from and about you:&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Registration Information</b> is the information you submit to register for a Fox Service, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code and birthday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Public Information and Posts</b> consist of comments or content that you post to the Fox Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Information from Social Media</b>. If you access or log-in to a Fox Service through a social media service or connect a Fox Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service. When you access the Fox Services through social media services or when you connect a Fox Service to social media services, you are authorizing Fox to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Activity Information</b>. When you access and interact with the Fox Services, Company and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Fox Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Fox Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data (including your precise location), or other transactional information for that device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier. Fox’s websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Fox Services, such as pages you have visited, the video and other content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third parties that support the Fox Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content (e.g. Facebook) or tracking aggregate Fox Services usage statistics (e.g. Google Analytics), may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Fox Services or third-party services. Fox does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled “To deliver relevant advertisements,” below.</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website, see <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html"><span>http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</span></a>. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the Fox Services.</p>
<p><b>Information from Other Sources</b>. We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information from social media services, commercially available sources and information from our Company Affiliates or business partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Do Not Track Signals</b>. At this time we do not respond to browser 'Do Not Track' signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>USE AND DISCLOSURE</b></li>

We may also share the same information with the social media service provider. By logging in with or connecting your Fox Services account with a social media service, you are authorizing us to share information we collect from and about you with the social media service provider, other users and your friends and you understand that the social media service’s use of the shared information will be governed by the social media service’s privacy policy.

<ol>
<li><b>SECURITY</b></li>

<ol>
<li><b>OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Updates to Privacy Policy</b>. Fox may modify this Privacy Policy. Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Fox Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Location of Data</b>. The Fox Services are hosted in and managed from the United States. If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States.

We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. It is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints, contractual, financial or legal requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Sensitive Information</b>. We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (such as social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Fox Services or otherwise.</p>
