<h3>7. Cookies</h3>
<p>In order to distinguish you from other users—especially other users on the same network as you— we need to use cookies to track your specific computer. Specifically, we use cookies to save your preferences, keep track of advertisements, and remember your shopping cart items. Additionally, our cookies may be accessible by third parties, or provided by third parties.

We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of use of any third party website or service that you visit.</p>
<h3>9. Third Party Access to Your Information</h3>
<p>We do our best to protect your information from being accessed by third parties. However, since we may employ outside maintenance personnel or use a third party to host our material, there are third party entities which may have custody or access to your information. Because of this, it is necessary that you permit us to give access to your information to third parties to the same extent that you authorize us to do so. For greater certainty, every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or systems. You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you. Additionally, we may store your information or share it with certain other third parties for reasons that may or may not be related to maintenance, advertising, marketing, or other purposes related to our business. The following is a non-exhaustive list of other entities that we may store, share, or transfer your information with:</p>
<ul>

<h3>11. Law Enforcement</h3>
<p>We may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either.</p>
