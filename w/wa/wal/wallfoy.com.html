	<li class="cat-item cat-item-1647"><a href="http://wallfoy.com/category/christmas" title="Here's a few facts about the origin of Christmas.  Christmas is a traditional celebration widely observed in many lands by Catholics and other Christian sects.  The celebration of Christmas used to be unacceptable and banned in England in 1647, as well as in North America between 1659 and 1581.  On the other hand, pagan devotees of Mithra celebrate a feast every 25th of December in honor of the birth of the sun god.  The Catholic Church then assigned the date of the winter Solstice or December 25th as the birth of Christ, and established a traditional celebration as a way to attract pagan devotees to Catholicism.  From then on the Catholic Church declared December 25 as the Christmas day and the tradition continues until modern times.

Many sorts of creatures are associated with the Halloween festivities such as vampires, zombies, werewolves, and other wicked forces.  On this day, people were masks of all types to portray themselves as one of the Halloween creatures to scare other people.  How did the celebration of Halloween began?   According to the Encyclopedia of American Folklore, “Halloween is integrally related to the prospect of contact with spiritual forces, many of which threaten or frighten.”  The Ancient Celtics performed various kinds of rituals in what they consider as the most sacred night of the year in order to be in contact with spiritual forces and calls the celebration as Samhain.  The Catholic Church embraced this celebration of the witches which has become an annual tradition, incorporating it with the All the Saints Day and All Souls Day celebrations.  Halloween may be called by different names such as the Day of the Dead in North America and Europe, the Dance of the Hooded Egunguns in Africa, the Bon Festival in Asia, and Kawsasqanchis in South America.
