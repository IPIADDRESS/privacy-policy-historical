Introduction</p><p>This Privacy Policy relates to Wallapop’s collection and use of your data when you use or access the Wallapop service, websites, servers, software applications, or content therefrom (together, the "Wallapop Service" or "Service").  This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into Wallapop’s<a href="">Terms and Conditions</a>.  Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms and Conditions.</p><p class="static-title">2.  Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information</p><p>Personally identifiable information (“PII”) is information that can be used to identify an individual person.  Examples of PII include a person’s name, home address, email address, or phone number.  We may receive and store any PII that you provide on our Service, send to us in an email or voluntarily provide to us in any other way.  As you use, access, or register for the Service, you may be asked to provide certain PII.</p><p class="static-title">3.  Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</p><p>Wallapop also collects data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with an individual person.  We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.  If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p><p class="static-title">4.  Automatic Data Collection</p><p>Wallapop uses automatic data collection technology when you use the Service to record information that identifies your computer, to track your use of the Service, and to collect certain basic information about you and your usage habits. This information includes information about your operating system, IP addresses, browser type, language, referring and exit pages, URLs, keywords, date, time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of a website you visit, and similar information concerning your use of the Service (collectively, the “Usage Information”).  Wallapop may collect this Usage Information by using cookies. Our cookie policy is described below.</p><p class="static-title">5.	Use of PII</p><p>Any PII you provide to Wallapop may be used by Wallapop for the following purposes:</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li><strong>(i)</strong>to make it possible to provide the Service;</li><li><strong>(ii)</strong>to answer your queries;</li><li><strong>(ii)</strong>to keep you informed, including by electronic means, about news, products, and services of Wallapop and its affiliates; and</li><li><strong>(iv)</strong>to keep you informed, including by electronic means, about news, products and services from third parties.</li></ul><p>Wallapop, like many businesses, sometimes hires third parties to perform certain business-related functions.  Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases, hosting services, and processing payments.  When Wallapop employs a third party to perform a function of this nature, we provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function, which may include PII of users.  Wallapop requires such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of such information and use such information only as necessary to provide Wallapop with designated services.</p><p>If Wallapop or all or substantially all of its assets are acquired, the information that Wallapop has collected, including without limitation PII, may be transferred along with our other business assets.</p><p>Wallapop may disclose any information, including, but not limited to, PII, to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at Wallapop’s discretion, or otherwise as required by law, including but not limited to responses to court orders and subpoenas.  Wallapop may also disclose PII, when Wallapop has reason to believe that someone is causing or may cause injury to or interference with Wallapop’s rights or property, other users of the Service, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p><p>Wallapop reserves the right to pass your PII on to third parties so that they may send you commercial communications, including by electronic means, concerning news, products, and services. Said third parties may be located in any country in the world with the international transfer of data to which that gives rise.  You may opt-out of Wallapop sharing your PII with third parties for marketing purposes at any time by sending an opt-out request to Wallapop at support@wallapop.com.</p><p>In order to make it possible to manage and provide the Service, Wallapop may also share your PII with any of the companies in its company group.  Said companies may be located in any country in the world, with the international transfer of data to which that gives rise. You may view the identity and location of said companies at the website www.wallapop.com.</p><p class="static-title">6.  International Transfer of Data</p><p> Wallapop uses the Kahuna Engagement Engine™ tool. To do so, you acknowledge and agree that your PII may be internationally accessed and/or transferred by the company Kahuna, Inc., located in the United States.  This tool allows Wallapop to analyze data related to messages sent by users.</p><p>Wallapop uses the Looker tool. To do so, you acknowledge and agree that your PII may be internationally accessed and/or transferred by the company Looker Data Sciences, Inc., located in the United States.  This tool allows Wallapop, by means of data analysis (business intelligence), to make business decisions.</p><p>If you are located outside of Spain, you acknowledge and agree that any PII you provide may be transferred to, and stored on, servers located in Spain, and you consent to the international transfer of your PII to and from Spain, and through other international jurisdictions.</p><p class="static-title">7.  Security Measures</p><p>Wallapop uses commercially reasonable efforts to protect PII from loss and unauthorized access. However, no security system is infallible. Wallapop cannot guarantee the security of its databases, nor can it guarantee that your PII will not be intercepted, copied, accessed, or stolen.</p><p class="static-title">8.  Minimum Age</p><p>The Wallapop Service is not intended for, and may not be used by, people under the age of 18. Without limiting the foregoing, Wallapop does not knowingly collect PII from children under the age of 13.  If you are under the age of 13, you are forbidden from using the Service and from giving Wallapop any PII.  If we learn that we have received PII from a child under the age of 13, or other jurisdictionally-applicable age, we will take steps to delete that PII as soon as possible</p><p class="static-title">9.  Viewing of PII Among Users</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that during normal operation of the Service, your PII may be viewed by other Users to facilitate contact and interaction.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information, including, but not limited to, PII, that you choose to make available to other users of the Service, and Wallapop is not responsible for the information that you choose to make available to other Users of the Service or the use thereof by any other user of the Service or any third party.</p><p class="static-title">10.  Messages</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that Wallapop has the right to access and store the content of messages and communications sent or received by the Users of the Service. Said access and storage aim to foster the proper use and normal operation of the Service as well as to comply with legal requirements.</p><p class="static-title">11.
