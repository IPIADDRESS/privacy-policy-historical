<h3 class="subberhead dark padbot">MARKETING</h3>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. </p><br>
<h3 class="subberhead dark padbot">PROMOTIONAL OFFERS FROM US</h3>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (this is “marketing”).</p>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing. You will also receive marketing communications from us if you have provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion and gave us your consent as part of that process.</p><br>
<h3 class="subberhead dark padbot">THIRD-PARTY MARKETING</h3>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any other company for marketing purposes.</p><br>
<h3 class="subberhead dark padbot">OPTING OUT</h3>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us.</p>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">Opting out of marketing messages will not prevent you receiving non-marketing messages from us, for example relating to products ordered from us, responses to customer service queries etc.</p><br>
<h3 class="subberhead dark padbot">CHANGE OF PURPOSE</h3>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.</p>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
</div>
<div class="border-sec">
<h2 class="subhead dark doublebot">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.
</p><ul class="sans med dark">
<li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary and below:</li>
<li>We use third party service providers to help us to administer certain activities on our behalf, such as fulfilling purchases and shipping products, processing credit card payments, sending emails, providing advertisements, analysing usage of our websites and apps, tracking effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, and allowing users to connect to their social network. We may share Personal Information about you with such third party service providers to the extent necessary for the sole purpose of enabling them to perform services on our behalf.</li>
<li>Here are examples of third-party service providers we use:</li>
<li><strong>Email Providers:</strong> Services are used to assist Wahoo in sending emails, consistent with applicable laws and the choices available to you under our privacy settings center</li>
<li><strong>Analytics Services:</strong> We use third-party service providers to help us better understand usage of our products and mobile apps, and for related purposes. The third parties we currently use to provide such analytics and related services are described under our <a href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.</p>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="border-sec">
<h2 class="subhead dark doublebot">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h2>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">Some of our external third parties are based in the USA, outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
</p><ul class="sans med dark">
<li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en</a></li>
<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en</a></li>
<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>
</div>
<div class="border-sec">
<h2 class="subhead dark doublebot">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;DATA SECURITY</h2>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="border-sec">
<h2 class="subhead dark doublebot">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;DATA RETENTION</h2>
<h3 class="subberhead dark padbot">OPTING OUT</h3>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes. We also keep this basic information about our customers for six years following your most recent purchase from us or to enable us to deal efficiently with any after-sales queries that you may have. We keep customer profile information that you have indicated you are happy for us to have in order to keep you up to date regarding our products, services and events and will keep this information until such time as you indicate you no longer wish us to keep this data, or for seven years following your most recent active interaction with us (e.g. clicking a link on an email we send you, taking you to our site), whichever of these two is shorter. We keep biometric customer data until such time as you no longer wish us to keep this data by deleting your account or up to a maximum of seven years from your last interaction with Wahoo in relation to the data.</p>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see [Request erasure] below for further information.</p>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="border-sec">
<h2 class="subhead dark doublebot">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h2>

<h3 class="subberhead dark padbot">NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED</h3>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p><br>
<h3 class="subberhead dark padbot">WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</h3>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p><br>
<h3 class="subberhead dark padbot">TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND</h3>
<p class="sans med dark padbot">We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
</div>
<div class="border-sec">
<h2 class="subhead dark doublebot">11.&nbsp;&nbsp;GLOSSARY&nbsp;</h2>
<h3 class="subberhead dark padbot">LAWFUL BASIS</h3>
<p class="sans med dark padbot"><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p>
<p class="sans med dark padbot"><strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>
<p class="sans med dark padbot"><strong>Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation</strong> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.</p>
<p class="sans med dark padbot"><strong>Consent</strong> means you have explicitly given us permission to process your personal data. In such circumstances we will have asked you a specific question and you will have entered information or ticked a tick-box to indicate your consent.</p><br>
<h3 class="subberhead dark padbot">THIRD PARTIES</h3>
<p class="sans med dark padbot"><strong>External third parties</strong> include:
</p><ul class="sans med dark>
        <li>Service providers acting as processors who provide IT and system administration services.</li>
        <li>Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based in the USA, UK and EU who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</li>
        <li>Tax regulators and other tax authorities acting as processors or joint controllers who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.</li>
        <li>Customer service call, email, webchat, display advertising and website behavioural service providers, acting as processors, based in the UK, EU or USA.</li>
        </ul><br />
        <h3 class=" subberhead="" dark="" padbot"="">YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
<p id="glos1" class="sans med dark padbot"><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
<p id="glos2" class="sans med dark padbot"><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
<p id="glos3" class="sans med dark padbot"><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
<p id="glos4" class="sans med dark padbot"><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p id="glos5" class="sans med dark padbot"><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. In such circumstances we may reserve the right to delete your personal data rather than hold it but restrict processing, where our processes are not set up to enable a restriction.</p>
<p id="glos6" class="sans med dark padbot"><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
<p id="glos7" class="sans med dark padbot"><strong>Request to opt out of automated profiling</strong> of your personal data. You have the legal right to opt-out of any automated profiling of your personal data that could have a legal consequence for you, and have a human being involved in the processing decision rather than it being automated. The only profiling of this type that we undertake is in our marketing activities, in which we tailor our marketing communications to your transactional history and product preferences. If you wish to opt-out of this automated profiling please contact us, though please be aware that our systems are not configured to send un-tailored marketing communications to you, so in practice opting out of automated profiling will result in you being opted out of receiving marketing communications from us.</p>
<p id="glos8" class="sans med dark padbot"><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.

We keep biometric customer data until such time as you no longer wish us to keep this data by deleting your account or up to a maximum of seven years from your last interaction with Wahoo in relation to the data.<\/p>\r\n        <p class=\"sans med dark padbot\">In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see [Request erasure] below for further information.<\/p>\r\n        <p class=\"sans med dark padbot\">In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.<\/p>\r\n      <\/div>\r\n\r\n      <div class=\"border-sec\">\r\n        <h2 class=\"subhead dark doublebot\">10.\u00a0\u00a0YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS<\/h2>\r\n        <p class=\"sans med dark padbot\">Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.

However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.<\/p><br \/>\r\n\r\n        <h3 class=\"subberhead dark padbot\">WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU<\/h3>\r\n        <p class=\"sans med dark padbot\">We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.<\/p><br \/>\r\n\r\n        <h3 class=\"subberhead dark padbot\">TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND<\/h3>\r\n        <p class=\"sans med dark padbot\">We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.<\/p>\r\n      <\/div>\r\n\r\n      <div class=\"border-sec\">\r\n        <h2 class=\"subhead dark doublebot\">11.\u00a0\u00a0GLOSSARY\u00a0<\/h2>\r\n        <h3 class=\"subberhead dark padbot\">LAWFUL BASIS<\/h3>\r\n        <p class=\"sans med dark padbot\"><strong>Legitimate Interest<\/strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service\/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.<\/p>\r\n        <p class=\"sans med dark padbot\"><strong>Performance of Contract<\/strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.<\/p>\r\n        <p class=\"sans med dark padbot\"><strong>Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation<\/strong> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.<\/p>\r\n        <p class=\"sans med dark padbot\"><strong>Consent<\/strong> means you have explicitly given us permission to process your personal data.  In such circumstances we will have asked you a specific question and you will have entered information or ticked a tick-box to indicate your consent.<\/p><br \/>\r\n        <h3 class=\"subberhead dark padbot\">THIRD PARTIES<\/h3>\r\n        <p class=\"sans med dark padbot\"><strong>External third parties<\/strong> include:\r\n        <ul class=\"sans med dark>\r\n        <li>Service providers acting as processors who provide IT and system administration services.<\/li>\r\n        <li>Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based in the USA, UK and EU who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.<\/li>\r\n        <li>Tax regulators and other tax authorities acting as processors or joint controllers who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.<\/li>\r\n        <li>Customer service call, email, webchat, display advertising and website behavioural service providers, acting as processors, based in the UK, EU or USA.<\/li>\r\n        <\/ul><br \/>\r\n        <h3 class=\"subberhead dark padbot\">YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS<\/h3>\r\n        <p id=\"glos1\" class=\"sans med dark padbot\"><strong>Request access<\/strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a \u201cdata subject access request\u201d). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.<\/p>\r\n        <p id=\"glos2\" class=\"sans med dark padbot\"><strong>Request correction<\/strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.<\/p>\r\n        <p id=\"glos3\" class=\"sans med dark padbot\"><strong>Request erasure<\/strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.<\/p>\r\n        <p id=\"glos4\" class=\"sans med dark padbot\"><strong>Object to processing<\/strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.<\/p>\r\n        <p id=\"glos5\" class=\"sans med dark padbot\"><strong>Request restriction of processing<\/strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data\u2019s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.  In such circumstances we may reserve the right to delete your personal data rather than hold it but restrict processing, where our processes are not set up to enable a restriction.<\/p>\r\n        <p id=\"glos6\" class=\"sans med dark padbot\"><strong>Request the transfer<\/strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.<\/p>\r\n        <p id=\"glos7\" class=\"sans med dark padbot\"><strong>Request to opt out of automated profiling<\/strong> of your personal data.  You have the legal right to opt-out of any automated profiling of your personal data that could have a legal consequence for you, and have a human being involved in the processing decision rather than it being automated.  The only profiling of this type that we undertake is in our marketing activities, in which we tailor our marketing communications to your transactional history and product preferences.  If you wish to opt-out of this automated profiling please contact us, though please be aware that our systems are not configured to send un-tailored marketing communications to you, so in practice opting out of automated profiling will result in you being opted out of receiving marketing communications from us.<\/p>\r\n        <p id=\"glos8\" class=\"sans med dark padbot\"><strong>Withdraw consent at any time<\/strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.<\/p><br \/>\r\n        <h3 class=\"subberhead dark padbot\">LIST OF COOKIES WE COLLECT<\/h3>\r\n        <p class=\"sans med dark padbot\">A list of cookies we collect can be found in our <a href=\"\/cookie-policy\">cookie policy.<\/a><\/p>\r\n      <\/div>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<\/div>","title":"Privacy Policy and Imprint | Wahoo Fitness"});}</script><script>(function(){var t=document.createElement('script');t.setAttribute("data-cordial-track-key","wahoofitness");t.setAttribute("data-cordial-url","track.cordial.io");t.setAttribute("data-auto-track",false);t.src='//track.cordial.io/track.js';t.async=true;t.onload=cordialMagento;document.body.appendChild(t);})();</script><script data-cordial-track-key="wahoofitness" data-cordial-url="track.cordial.io" data-auto-track="false" src="//track.cordial.io/track.js" async=""></script>
