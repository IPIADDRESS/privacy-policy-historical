	Information Sharing</h2>


	<p></p><p>When you access or use the Websites, we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your personal information as described in this Privacy Notice. Wahl will not share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your private personal information to third parties without your consent, except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Notice, including to:</p><p></p>

	<p></p><p><strong>Aggregated Non-Personal Data: </strong>We may disclose aggregated, non-personal data received from providing the Websites, including information that does not identify any individual, without restriction. Wahl may share demographic information with business partners, but it will be aggregated and de-personalized, so that personal information is not revealed.</p><p></p>

	<p></p><p><strong>Within Wahl: </strong>We may share and process information internally within Wahl and with our subsidiaries and affiliates. Wahl’s personnel may have access to your information as needed to provide and operate the Websites in the normal course of business. This includes information regarding your use and interaction with the Websites.</p><p></p>

	<p></p><p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Wahl works with various organizations and individuals to help provide the Websites to you ("<strong>Service Providers</strong>"), such as website and data hosting companies and companies providing analytics information, like Google Analytics. Wahl needs to engage such third-party Service Providers to help us operate, provide, and market the Websites. These third parties have only limited access to your information and may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf. Information we share to our Service Providers may include both information you provide to us and information we collect about you, including personal data and information from data collection tools like cookies, web beacons, and log files.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wahl takes reasonable steps to ensure that our Service Providers are obligated to reasonably protect your information on Wahl’s behalf. If Wahl becomes aware that a Service Provider is using or disclosing information improperly, we will take commercially reasonable steps to end or correct such improper use or disclosure.</p>

<p>We share personal information with our Service Providers on the legal basis of Wahl’s legitimate interests in providing you with the Websites. Our engagement of Service Providers is often necessary for us to provide the Websites to you, particularly where such companies play important roles like helping us keep our Websites operating and secure. In some other cases, these service providers aren’t strictly necessary for us to provide the Websites, but help us make it better, like by helping us conduct research into how we could better serve our users. In these latter cases, we have a legitimate interest in working with service providers to make our Websites better.</p><p></p>

	<p></p><p><strong>Business Transactions:</strong> Wahl may purchase other businesses or their assets, sell our business assets, or be involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets (a “<strong>Business Transaction</strong>”). Your information, including personal data, may be among assets sold or transferred as part of a Business Transaction.&nbsp;</p><p></p>

	<p></p><p><strong>Safety and Lawful Requests: </strong>We may be required to disclose Websites user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We generally do not disclose user information unless we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. We may share your information when we believe it is necessary to comply with applicable laws, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Websites or using the Wahl name, or to protect the safety of any person. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents, or government agencies. Nothing in this Privacy Notice is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.</p><p></p>

	
		<h2 id="Your Rights">
	
	Your Rights and Choices Regarding Your Information</h2>


	<p></p><p><strong>Your Rights</strong></p>

<p>Wahl seeks to ensure all individuals are provided with the rights mandated by their governing jurisdiction. Not all of the rights discussed herein will apply to each individual data subject and may not apply to you depending upon your jurisdiction.</p>

<p>You may benefit from a number of rights in relation to your information that we process. Some rights apply only in certain limited cases, depending on your location. If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your personal information, you can do so by contacting us. Upon request, Wahl will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. &nbsp; In certain cases where we process your information, you may also have a right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your personal information. In certain circumstances, you also have the right to request the deletion of your personal information, and to obtain a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible format.</p>

<p>To the extent that such rights are mandated by the laws applicable to the individual data subject, such as all data subjects residing in the European Union (“EU”), the following rights may apply:&nbsp; the right to access (GDPR, Article 15); the right to rectification (GDPR, Article16); the right to erasure (GDPR, Article 17); the right to restrict processing (GDPR, Articles 18); the right of object (GDPR, Article 21); and if applicable, the right to data portability (GDPR, Article 20). You may also have a right to lodge a complaint with an appropriate data privacy regulatory authority (GDPR, Article 77).</p>

<p>If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained in this Privacy Notice, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons. Where we use your data for direct marketing purposes, you can always object by following the unsubscribe process in such communications or changing your account settings.</p>

<p>Where you have provided consent to certain data processing, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time by contacting Wahl at:&nbsp; <a href="mailto:privacy@wahlclipper.com">privacy@wahlclipper.com</a>.&nbsp; A withdrawal of consent will not affect the validity of our use of your personal data up until the point you have withdrawn your consent.&nbsp;</p><p></p>

	<p></p><p><strong>Access To The Information Wahl Has Collected About You</strong></p>

<p>Wahl welcomes you to contact us regarding the information we have collected about you, including regarding the nature and accuracy of the data that has been collected about you, to request an update, modification, or deletion of your information, to opt-out of certain Websites uses of your information, or to withdraw any consent you may have granted to Wahl.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note requests to delete or remove your information do not necessarily ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information posted, and removed information may persist in backup copies indefinitely. Please note that if you choose to delete your information or opt-out of the collection and use of your information, you understand that certain features, including but not limited to access to the Websites, may no longer be available to you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may retain the information we receive about you for as long as necessary to fulfil our contractual and legal obligations, or indefinitely, but information generally will be retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the information was collected, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may delete your personal data from our systems as part of a data retention plan.&nbsp; Following termination or deactivation of a Websites Account, Wahl may retain your information and content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, and audit purposes.</p><p></p>

	<p></p><p><strong>Opting-Out Of Communications From Wahl</strong></p>

<p>Users may opt-out of receiving certain communications from Wahl by following the unsubscribe process described in an email communication, or by contacting us using the contact information provided above.

	<p></p><p><strong>Do Not Track</strong></p>

<p>Wahl does not currently employ a process for automatically responding to “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals sent by web browsers, mobile devices, or other mechanisms. Per industry standards, third parties may be able to collect information, including personal data, about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services when you use Websites. You may opt out of online behavioral ads at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.

		<h2 id="Security">

	<p></p><p><strong>Security Of Your Information</strong></p>

<p>Wahl takes reasonable efforts to secure and protect the privacy, accuracy, and reliability of your information and to protect it from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Wahl implements security measures as we deem appropriate and consistent with industry standards. As no data security protocol is impenetrable, Wahl cannot guarantee the security of our systems or databases, nor can we guarantee that personal information we collect about you will not be breached, intercepted, destroyed, accessed, or otherwise disclosed without authorization. Accordingly, any information you transfer to or from Websites is provided at your own risk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please do your part to help us keep your information secure. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and Websites Account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or Websites Account. Wahl specifically reserves the right to terminate your access to the Websites and any contract you have with Wahl related to the Websites in the event it learns or suspects you have disclosed your Websites Account or password information to an unauthorized third party.</p><p></p>

	Additional Provisions Regarding The Websites &amp; Your Information</h2>


	<p></p><p><strong>Transfer And Storage Of Your Information </strong></p>

<p>Please note information Wahl collects about you may be transferred, processed and/or accessed by us in the United States, Germany, or another country where we, or our Service Providers operate. Please be aware your personal data may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state or country where privacy laws may differ from and may not be as protective as those where you live. If you are located outside the United States and choose to allow us to collect information about you, please be aware that Wahl may transfer your personal data to the United States and process and store it there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are located in the European Economic Area ("EEA") or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information to a country or jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, as disclosed in this Privacy Notice.
