<h2><a id="gather" name="gather"></a>How We Gather Information to Understand Your Financial Needs</h2>

<p>The information we gather about you helps us to better understand your financial needs and to provide more personalized, efficient service to you.&nbsp; For example, this information may prompt us to suggest overdraft protection for your checking account, or recommend an investment account that has the potential to pay you higher earnings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The information we gather comes from a variety of sources, including:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Information you provide to us (such as information on applications about assets and income)</li>

<li>Information related to your transactions with Wachovia (such as account balance and payment history)</li>

<li>Information we receive from credit reporting agencies and other companies (such as your credit history) when you apply for a service</li>

<li>Information we obtain from others at your request (such as information about assets held at another institution for inclusion in a financial plan)&nbsp;</li>

<li>Information obtained when you use Internet products and services (such as application and transaction information and information contained in e-mails you send us)</li>
</ul>

<p>We carefully manage all the information gathered about you as described in the following section.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="right"><img height="10" alt="" src="/file/BTTButton.gif" width="10" border="0">&nbsp;<a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2><a id="manage" name="manage"></a>How We Manage Information to Serve Your Needs</h2>

<p><em>Within Wachovia Corporation</em></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">We consolidate information about customers within the companies that make up Wachovia Corporation, including:&nbsp;</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Information based on your transactions with us (for example, information that we would collect about your loan amounts and deposits with us in order to offer you a rate based on total balances) and contact information (such as your name and address)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Non-transactional information received from others (such as credit or employment history) to evaluate your eligibility for various financial services (for example, a line of credit at a special rate)</li>
</ul>

<p>You may tell us not to share non-transactional information with other Wachovia companies*.&nbsp; For more information, see the section below entitled,&nbsp;<a href="#choices">Your Choices as a Customer</a>.</p>

<p><em>Outside of Wachovia Corporation</em></p>

<p>Other than limited exceptions like those below, we do not provide customer information to companies outside of Wachovia Corporation.&nbsp; You do not need to request this confidentiality; it is our standard practice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In order to serve your needs, we may provide all of the information we gather to:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>specialists that perform business operations for us (such as check printing)</li>

<li>companies that act on our behalf to market our services, or companies with whom we have entered into a joint marketing agreement in order to provide you with valuable financial services that we do not offer&nbsp; (such as credit cards)*</li>

<li>others only as permitted or required by law (such as to protect against fraud or in response to a subpoena)</li>
</ul>

<p>We select very carefully the companies that provide services on our behalf, or offer you financial services that we do not provide.&nbsp; Also, we only provide them with information that we believe is necessary to fulfill their responsibilities or to provide a financial service to you. These companies are prevented by legal agreement from using this information for their own purposes or selling this information to others.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>*Other Applicable Laws</b></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The practices described above are in accordance with federal law.&nbsp; We may also be subject to other privacy requirements under applicable state law.&nbsp; For example, Vermont law places additional limits on sharing information about Vermont residents.&nbsp; So long as they remain residents of Vermont, we will not share information we collect about Vermont residents with companies outside of Wachovia, except:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<div class="MsoBodyText">With companies that perform marketing or other services on our behalf;</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="MsoBodyText">Contact information (like name and address), and transaction information (such as your payment history) to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements;</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="MsoBodyText">With the authorization or consent of the Vermont resident; or</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="MsoBodyText">As permitted by law.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoBodyText">We also will not share non-transactional information about Vermont residents received from others within Wachovia except with the authorization or consent of the Vermont resident.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a id="choices" name="choices"></a>Your Choices as a Customer</h2>

<p>We are committed to helping you manage your finances in the most effective way, and helping you maximize the return on your financial investments.&nbsp; For these reasons, we may contact you to offer financial advice and inform you of different options that may be of value to you.&nbsp; If you are comfortable with the ways in which we contact you currently, there is no need to indicate your preferences.&nbsp; We recognize, however, that you may wish to limit the ways in which we contact you for marketing purposes and we offer the options listed below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Please do not contact me by telephone for marketing purposes.</li>

<li>Please do not contact me by mail for marketing purposes.</li>

<li>Please do not contact me by e-mail for marketing purposes.</li>

<ol dir="ltr" start="4">
<li>
<div>Please do not share, among Wachovia companies, non-transactional information about me that you receive from others.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">Whatever your preferences, we will honor your wishes and respect your privacy.&nbsp; Your preferences will remain in effect until you tell us otherwise.&nbsp; You do not need to notify us if you have already indicated your preferences to us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To discuss your options, inform us of a preference, or provide us with feedback, call us at (866) 203-5722 (CAP, IRA, Brokerage and Insurance customers should call (877) 358-1114), visit a Wachovia financial center or complete our online&nbsp;<a href="https://funb.firstunion.com/cgi-bin/privacy/funb_optout.cgi">Consumer Privacy Preference Form</a>.</p>

<p>If you contact us, we will assume your preferences apply to you only - unless you tell us that they also apply to other individuals listed on your accounts.</p>

<p>Please note that we are committed to providing you with superior service.&nbsp; Occasionally, we may need to contact you to resolve a problem or to service your accounts.&nbsp; For example, if we observe unusual activity on your debit card, we may contact you to verify your purchases and confirm that they are authorized.</p>
