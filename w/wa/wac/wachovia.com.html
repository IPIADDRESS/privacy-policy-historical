<h2><a id="gather" name="gather"></a>How We Gather Information to Understand Your Financial Needs</h2>

<p>The information we gather about you helps us to better understand your financial needs and to provide more personalized, efficient service to you.&nbsp; For example, this information may prompt us to suggest overdraft protection for your checking account, or recommend an investment product that has the potential to pay you higher earnings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The information we gather comes from a variety of sources, including:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Information you provide to us (such as information on applications about assets and income).</li>

<li>Information related to your transactions with Wachovia (such as account balance and payment history).</li>

<li>Information we receive from credit reporting agencies and other companies (such as your credit history) when you apply for a service.</li>

<li>Information we obtain from others at your request (such as information about assets held at another institution for inclusion in a financial plan).</li>

<li>Information obtained when you use Internet products and services (such as application and transaction information and information contained in e-mails you send us).</li>

<p class="MsoBodyText">We carefully manage all the information gathered about you as described in the following section.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a id="manage" name="manage"></a>How We Manage Information to Serve Your Needs</h2>

<p><em>Within Wachovia Corporation</em></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">We consolidate information about customers within the companies that make up Wachovia Corporation, including:&nbsp;</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Information based on your transactions with us (for example, information that we would collect about your loan amounts and deposits with us in order to offer you a rate based on total balances) and contact information (such as your name and address).&nbsp;</li>

<li>Credit information received from you or others (such as information from your credit application or your employment or credit history) to evaluate your eligibility for various financial services (for example, a line of credit at a special rate).</li>
</ul>

<p>You may tell us not to share credit information with other Wachovia companies*.&nbsp; For more information, see the section below entitled, <a href="#choices">Your Choices as a Customer.</a></p>

<p><em>Outside of Wachovia Corporation</em></p>

<p>Other than limited exceptions like those below, we do not provide customer information to companies outside of Wachovia Corporation.&nbsp; You do not need to request this confidentiality; it is our standard practice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In order to serve your needs, we may provide all of the information we gather to:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Service providers that perform business operations for us (such as check printing)</li>

<li>Companies that act on our behalf to market our services, or companies with whom we have entered into a joint marketing agreement in order to provide you with valuable financial services that we do not offer&nbsp; (such as credit cards)*</li>

<li>Others only as permitted or required by law (such as to protect against fraud or in response to a subpoena)</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoBodyText">We select very carefully the companies that provide services on our behalf, or offer you financial services that we do not provide.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, we only provide them with information that we believe is necessary to fulfill their responsibilities or to provide a financial service to you. These companies are prevented by legal agreement from using this information for their own purposes or selling this information to others.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>*Other Applicable Laws</b></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The practices described above are in accordance with federal law.&nbsp; &nbsp;You may have other protections under applicable state laws, such as Vermont and California.&nbsp; To the extent these state laws apply, we will comply with them when we share information about you.&nbsp; For example, Vermont law places additional limits on sharing information about Vermont residents.&nbsp; As long as they remain residents of Vermont, we will not share information we collect about Vermont residents to companies outside of Wachovia, except:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<div class="MsoBodyText">To companies that perform marketing or other services on our behalf;</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="MsoBodyText">Contact information (like name and address), and transaction information (such as your payment history) to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements;</div>
