<b>PRIVACY
POLICY</b>

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">We respect the privacy of
visitors to our site. This Privacy Policy governs the use and collection of
information from you by Cox Texas Newspapers, L.P., d/b/a Waco Tribune-Herald
("we" or "us") through your use of this site. This Privacy
Policy does not apply to any information you may provide to us through other
means; for example, at a live event, via mail, or via telephone. Please read
this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our online privacy
practices. By visiting this site, you agree that your visit, and any dispute
over our online privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy Policy and our
Visitor Agreement. Questions regarding privacy issues should be directed to our
General Manager:

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</b>

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">Children should always get
permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves
(such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to
us or to anyone else. We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to register with
our site or to provide any other personally identifying information.If you’re under 13, please do not
provide us with any personally identifying information about yourself (such as
your name, your email address or your phone number).

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE
COLLECT</b>

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">The information we gather falls
into two categories: (1) information (for example, your name and address) that
you voluntarily supply when you register or initiate transactions, and (2)
information gathered on usage patterns and preferences as visitors navigate
through our sites, use our services such as free email, or read our email newsletters.
In some cases, it its an agent or affiliate of ours that collects the
information on our behalf. Third party providers featured on or linked to by
our site, such as vendors of products and services offered through our site,
may be gathering the same kinds of information. 

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>Registration Information</b>. To make use of certain features that we may make
available on our site (such as to receive email newsletters, or post a
classified ad) visitors need to register and to provide certain information as
part of the registration process. We may also ask for information from those
who buy products or services or conduct other transactions on our site. (We may
ask, for example, for your name, email address, sex, age, zip code or credit
card number, and we might request information on your interest in sports,
personal finance, the performing arts, and the like.) The information you
supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our site
to your interests and make them more useful to you, and to process e-commerce
transactions. 

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">The more you tell us about
yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such information is
entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information we need, we may be
unable to provide you with services we make available to other visitors to our
site. And we can't send you email alerting you to a new service we're offering,
or breaking news that may interest you if you don't tell us what you're
interested in and give us your email address.

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>Contests and Other
Promotions. </b>From time to time, we may
offer contests, sweepstakes or other promotions on our site. If you enter one
of these promotions, you'll have to provide information about yourself (such as
your name, address, telephone number and email address) so that we can contact
you if you win. We may share this information with our parent company, Cox
Enterprises, Inc., with any wholly or majority-owned subsidiary of Cox
Enterprises, Inc. and any co-sponsor of the promotion (we will identify any
co-sponsor in the official rules for the promotion). If you don't want us to
collect the information requested in the registration form or to provide it to
Cox Enterprises, any wholly or majority-owned subsidiary of Cox Enterprises,
Inc. or contest co-sponsors, please do not enter the contest or sweepstakes. 

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>Email
Newsletters.</b>&nbsp; We may also offer you the opportunity to subscribe to email
newsletters on topics that we believe are of interest to our visitors.If you have opted to receive a particular
newsletter, you may always unsubscribe later if you decide not to receive
further mailings of the newsletter from us.&nbsp; See “Opting Out” below.

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>Cookies</b>. To help make our sites more responsive to the
needs of our visitors, we use a standard feature of browser software, called a
"cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of
user ID, if you will, that resides on your computer. The cookie doesn't
actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access
our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for
example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your
computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you
supply. A cookie can't read unrelated data off your hard drive. Our advertisers
and the third parties that provide products or services through our site may
also assign their own cookies to your browser, a process that we don't control.


</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">We use cookies to help us
tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service.
For example, we use cookies to avoid showing you the same ad, repeatedly,
during a single visit. In addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on
our site visited by our users. We can build a better site if we know which pages
our users are visiting and how often. Of course, you can set your browser not
to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the
personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to our site. 

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>Other Methods of Collecting
Information</b>. Our web pages may contain
electronic images (called "single-pixel GIFs" or "web
beacons") that allow us and our vendors to count users who have visited
particular pages or to access certain cookies. We may use these tools and other
technologies to recognize which pages users visit, and which links they click
on. These features may also be included in our email newsletters so that we can
learn which messages have been opened and acted upon. We may also be able to
verify your online purchases from us or from third party sites that have agreed
to share such information with us. 

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>Browser Level Information
and IP Addresses</b>. Our web servers
automatically collect limited information about your computer configuration
when you visit our site, including the type of browser software you use, the
operating system you're running, the resolution of your computer monitor, the
website that referred you, and your IP address. (Your IP address is a numerical
address that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your
computer so that data (such as the web pages you want to view) can be
transmitted to you. We also use IP address information for systems
administration and trouble shooting purposes. Your IP address does not tell us
who you are.) We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon
request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, and to measure
traffic within our site. 

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</b>

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>Why we want to know. </b>As with any business, it's important for us to know
our customers -- their needs, their likes, what they want and expect from us.
Unlike most businesses, however, we deliver a valuable product to our customers
without asking for anything in return. It's like prime-time television, only
better for you! Since we make most of this site available without charge to
you, we rely heavily on advertisers to produce the income necessary to operate
our site. Advertisers are like most people: They expect something in return for
the money they spend. They want to know how many people will see their ad and
how often -- in other words, how effective their ad is likely to be. So it's
important that we be able to tell advertisers who our audience is. 

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>Advertisers</b>. Without your permission, we will not share the
personally-identifiable information you provide when registering on our site
with advertisers. We will, however, take the information you provide and
aggregate it with data from all the other people that use this site and
associated services. Then we will use that pool of information to inform our
advertisers about our audience without identifying you personally. For example,
we'll be able to say to an advertiser: "We have 3,470 readers in this ZIP
code," which happens to be your location. 

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>Vendors and Service
Providers</b>. To make our sites more valuable
to our visitors, we may offer some features in conjunction with other providers
(“Provider Partners”). We may, for example, make chat, email
newsletters, email services and online classifieds services available through
cooperative arrangements with providers that specialize in operating such
services. In some instances, our Provider Partners will have the same access to
your information as we do. Their use of the information will be subject to the
terms of their respective privacy policies, which you can find on their
websites. 

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>Our Affiliates. </b>We may share the information that we collect from
you with our parent company, Cox Enterprises, Inc. and with any wholly or
majority-owned subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, Inc. so that we and they can
provide you with products and services provided by these entities that we
believe may be of interest to you.

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>Statistical Information</b>. Much of the information we collect is in the form
of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic that visits various pages within
our sites, and the habits and preferences of our audience. Such aggregated
information does not include any information that would identify you
personally. We may use such aggregated information and disclose it to third
parties as we see fit. 

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>Sites to Which We Link</b>. Of course, our site includes links to plenty of
other websites, and provide access to products and services offered by third
parties, whose privacy policies we don't control. When you access another site
or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through our
sites, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of
the operator of the site you're visiting or the provider of such products or
services. 

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>Other Disclosures</b>. We may occasionally release information about our
visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Visitor
Agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our
sites, the public, our customers, or our company and its employees, agents,
partners and affiliates. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various
assets. In the unlikely event that our company, or the bulk of our assets
relating to this site, is acquired by another company, information on our
visitors would be among the transferred assets. 
<br>
<br><b>OPTING OUT</b> 



<br>If you register with us, you will have the opportunity to
review, update, or delete the information you have provided us at any time
(except, of course, any information that we do not store). If you remove your
registration information completely, you may not be able to continue using
certain services that require registration (such as free email). You agree that
we may use your information to contact you for customer service, to inform you
of important changes or additions to our site or the services offered over our
site and to send you administrative notices or any communications relevant to
your use of our site. If you do not wish to receive these notices, please email
us by <a href="notification.html">using this form</a>. 

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">If you have subscribed to one of our email newsletters, you
will always have the opportunity to unsubscribe from future mailings (for
example, by clicking on an unsubscribe link in an email newsletter or by going
back to our site). 



</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">If you have submitted your information on a page provided in
conjunction with one of our Provider Partners, the information you submit may
be jointly maintained by us and the Provider Partner. If you decide to opt out
on our site, you may also need to contact the Provider Partner separately to
request the Provider Partner to remove your information from its database. 

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">

<b>STORAGE
OF INFORMATION.</b>

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">All information gathered on our
site is stored within a database operated by us or by a contractor on our
behalf. Sensitive information, such as your password is encrypted for storage.
For e-commerce transactions, in certain instances we may transmit your billing
information using encryption. Encryption scrambles your credit card number and
personal information. However, as effective as encryption technology is, no
security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our
database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted
while being transmitted to us over the Internet. 

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1"><b>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY
POLICY</b> 

</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">A final note: The Web is an
evolving medium. If we need to change our privacy policy at some point in the
future, we'll post the changes before they take effect.
