<ul>

</ul>
<h3><strong>2. How We Get Data About You</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use tools like cookies, web beacons, analytics services, and advertising providers to gather the data listed below. Some of these tools offer you the ability to opt out of data collection.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; <strong>2.1 Cookies</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use and may allow other </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third party advertisers) use server log files and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web beacons (together, </span><strong>“Data Collection Tools”</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">) when you access and use the Services.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You may read our </span><a href="https://waplog.com/home/cookie_policy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookie Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more information on why we use them (such as authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features) and how you can better control their use, through your browser settings and other tools.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use cookies (small files that websites send to your device to uniquely identify your browser or device or to store data in your browser) for things like analyzing your use of the Services, personalizing your experience, making it easier to log into the Services, and recognizing you when you return. We use web beacons (small objects that allow us to measure the actions of visitors and users using the Services) for things like identifying whether a page was visited, identifying whether an email was opened, and advertising more efficiently by excluding current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new mobile app download.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can set your web browser to alert you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, limit the types of cookies you allow, or refuse cookies altogether. If you do, you may not be able to use some or all features of the Services, and your experience may be different or less functional.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including our Services, do not currently respond to DNT signals.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2.2 Analytics</strong></span></h4>

We use this data to improve the Services, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">better understand how the Services perform on different devices and provide information that may be of interest to you. All the information we send is anonymized and cannot be tracked back to specific users. In other words,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it is not possible to draw conclusions about a specific person.</span></p>

<h3><strong>5.&nbsp;Your Rights</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have certain rights around the use of your data, including the ability to opt out of promotional emails, cookies, and collection of your data by certain analytics providers. You can update or terminate your account from within our Services, and can also contact us for individual rights requests about your personal data. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Access / Update tools in the service:</strong> Tools and account settings that help you to access, rectify or delete information that you provided to us and that’s associated with your account directly within the service. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Device permissions:</strong> Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and location services as well as push notifications. You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to remember:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Reviewing your information:</strong> Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can request a copy of your personal information by sending us an email at</span> <a href="mailto:customerdesk@waplog.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customerdesk@waplog.com</span></a><a href="https://account.gotinder.com/data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Updating your information:</strong> If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">please contact us via</span> <a href="mailto:customerdesk@waplog.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customerdesk@waplog.com</span></a><a href="https://www.gotinder.com/help"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other user will have to contact our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy Officer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide their written consent before the information is released.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Uninstall:</strong> You can stop all information collected by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Accountability:</strong>&nbsp;In certain countries, including in the European Union, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where we are established.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to exercise any of your rights listed above please visit Feedback Page or email us at <a href="http://customerdesk@waplog.com">customerdesk</a></span><a href="http://customerdesk@waplog.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">@waplog.com</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a></p>
<h3><strong>6. Data Retention</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable law. To protect the safety and security of our users on and off our Services, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account deletion. During this period, some of your account information will be retained although the account will of course not be visible on the Services anymore. Even after your account is terminated, all your data is deleted except some basic account data like email address, phone number, username, name, and surname. We retain these data for as long as we have a legitimate purpose to do so (and in accordance with applicable law), including to assist with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may retain and disclose such data pursuant to this Privacy Policy after your account has been terminated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion of your account, unless:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some “traffic data” is kept for some time to comply with statutory data retention obligations) as well as to prevent bot systems that are abusing the system;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for instance, records of consent to our </span><a href="https://waplog.com/home/terms_of_service"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Service, Privacy Policy and other similar consents are kept for five years);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept for anti-fraud and anti-spam purposes. It is retained to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents like fraud from opening a new account.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Correspondence with our Customer Support team will be retained for longer to allow us to deal with any subsequent queries you may have but will usually be deleted within 6 years if there are no queries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anonymized information about activity on our Services is retained for longer periods of time for statistical and product research purposes but this is not attributable to an individual once the profile has been deleted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific time frame due to technical constraints.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">deleted data may also be available for up to 72 hours due to caching systems and the interconnection of proxy servers. Some of your data like photos may be in cache for 30 days since the CDN service is renewed every 30 days. </span></p>
<h3><strong>7. Data Protection and Security</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure. Your password is an important part of our security system, and it is your responsibility to protect it. You should not share your password with any third party, and if you believe your password or account has been compromised, you should change it immediately and contact <a href="mailto:customerdesk@waplog.com">customerdesk@waplog.com</a> with any concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage, and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may suspend your use of all or part of the Services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are not responsible for virus protection outside our service network. We are also not responsible for damage or destruction of user data. We will pursue every detected attack by hackers, etc. under civil law and, if necessary, by the prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of a breach, we will notify; the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">EU representative</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s, our DPO and our users who were or potentially were affected by the breach within 72 hours of the attack. We will get in contact via email thus, it is important that you sign up with a valid email address that you often check so you are notified of any harmful attacks that may occur. </span></p>
<h3><strong>8. Children’s Privacy </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Services are restricted to users who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit users under the age of 18 on our platform and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available through the service. If we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal data, we will take steps to terminate that person’s registration and delete their profile information from our Services. If we do delete a Profile because you violated our no children rule, we may retain basic account and profile information to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new profile.</span></p>
<h3><strong>9. International Transfer Policy</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to provide the Services to you, we must transfer your data to our servers and process it there. By visiting or using our Services, you consent to the storage of your data on servers. If you are using the Services, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your data. Specifically, personal data collected in Switzerland and the European Economic Area (“EEA”) is transferred and stored outside those areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That data is also processed outside of Switzerland and the EEA by our Waplog group companies, or our service providers, including to process transactions, facilitate payments and provide support services as described in Section 3 &amp; 4. We have entered into data processing agreements with our service providers that restrict and regulate their processing of your data on our behalf. By submitting your data or using our Services, you consent to this transfer, storage, and processing by Waplog and its processors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We operate a global network of servers including in Germany, Netherlands, Turkey, and Canada. Data collected by advertising partners may also be held outside the European Economic Area. We ensure that the data is adequately protected by ensuring that valid, legal mechanisms are in place. If you want more information relating to the nature of the safeguards we have in place please email <a href="mailto:%20customerdesk@waplog.com">customerdesk</a></span><a href="mailto:%20customerdesk@waplog.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">@waplog.com</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a></p>
<h3><strong>10. Privacy Policy Changes</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections, this policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.</span></p>
