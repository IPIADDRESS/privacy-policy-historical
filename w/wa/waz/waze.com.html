			Introduction
		</div>
		<p>
		"Personal Information" means any information that may be used to identify you, such as a first and last name, a home, work or other physical address, phone number, email address, date of birth, car information,  and information about your yourself, such as your driving routes.
		</p>
		<p>
		We do not require you to provide Personal Information to use the Waze Service. However, for certain services, you must create an account ("Account") and provide us with your mobile phone number and an email. We use your phone number to send you a text message containing a link to download software and including a nickname and password. We then delete your phone number. We encourage you to personalize your Account by changing your password, and changing your nickname to one that does not identify you personally.

		The Way We Use Personal Information
		</div>
		<p>
		You are not required to submit any Personal Information to us. If you do choose to submit Personal Information to us, then we will use it to send you updates, to improve our services to you, recommend the shortest routes between work and home, to contact you and to authenticate your access to our services.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 If you provide us Personal Information such as your driving routes and your address, this will be privately accessible only to you on the Site and in some cases on the mobile client. Your public profile will include information that does NOT personally identify you, such as your gender, age, city and state. You can delete this profile if you wish.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		We may display information that does NOT personally identify you, such as your nickname, avatar, mood icon, and driving route and distance. You can turn this off from the mobile client and be totally anonymous.
		</p>
		<p>
		We may provide aggregate information, which is NOT personally identifiable, to third parties.
		</p>
		<p>
		We may also use your email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding our services.
		</p>
		<p>
		Finally, we may disclose your Personal Information if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce our Terms of Use including investigations of potential violations thereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Waze, its users, yourself or the public.
