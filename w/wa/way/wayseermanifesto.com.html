 <p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Order Forms and Purchases</h3>
 <p>Our   site uses an order form for you to purchase information, products, and   services. We collect your contact information (i.e., mail and e-mail   addresses), financial information (i.e., credit card numbers), and   demographic information (i.e., zip code and state).

Information collected on this Web site   from those who have elected to receive offers from business partners of   the Company is made available to such business partners. We release   account and other personal information when we believe release is   appropriate to comply with law or to protect the rights, property, or   safety of the Company, our users, or others.
