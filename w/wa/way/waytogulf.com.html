</ul>
<p>

    enable third parties to see your personal information and to contact you. Profile information may

    be used for networking with other community members or may be visible to employers who are

    using the waytogulf Site. In addition, portions of your searchable resume (but not your contact

    information) may be made public in your networking profile.
</p>
<p>
    Information you post in public areas of the site or place in the searchable resume database will be

    accessed, used, and stored by others around the world, including those in countries that might not

    have legislation that guarantees adequate protection of personal information as defined by your

    country of residence. By providing your personal information for inclusion in our database, you

    acknowledge that you consent to your information being used as described here. While waytogulf

    takes measures to safeguard your information from unauthorized access or inappropriate use by

    third parties, waytogulf does not control these third parties and we are not responsible for their use

    of information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of the waytogulf Site.

    Accordingly, you should ensure that you do not post sensitive information, including personality

    profiles, to the waytogulf Site.
</p>
<p>
    We use data we have about you to determine whether you might be interested in the

    opportunities, products or services of a particular third party. We show you targeted ads on our

    sites or other sites with which we have a business relationship. These ads are targeted based on

    information we collect about you and information about you we acquire from third parties.
</p>
<p>
    We disclose to third parties within your country and abroad your personal information, combined

    personal, demographic, behavioral or indirect information, as set forth below:
</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>
        1. We disclose your resume to employers who have posted job opportunities that may be of

        interest to you on the Web Site when you apply for those jobs.
    </li>
    <li>
        2. We may share your information with third parties who help us in the delivery of our own

        products and services to you. We disclose information to companies and individuals we

        employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting our web servers,

        analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and

        providing customer service. These companies and individuals may be located in a

        country, whose data protection legislation is different from your country, and they will

        have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they

        may not share that information with any other third party or use that data for any other

        purpose. We will remain responsible for any information shared in this way.
    </li>
    <li>
        3. We may disclose such information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For

        example, if you make your resume searchable, then all parties with access to our

        searchable resume database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. If you

        indicate by configuring your profile that you would like to receive information about the

        opportunities, products or services of third parties, we supply your contact information to

        select third parties such as employers, recruiters, data aggregators, marketers or others for

        the purpose of sending you e-mail or otherwise communicating with you. We use data we

        have about you (such as the interests and preferences you have expressed) to determine

        whether you might be interested in the opportunities, products or services of a particular

        third party. For example, if you indicate that you would like to receive information about

        the opportunities, products or services of third parties at the time you register for a

        waytogulf account, we supply your contact information to third parties such as employers,

        recruiters, data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or

        otherwise communicating with you.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to the Sites with waytogulf's

    clients, partners, other Site visitors, and other third parties so that they can understand the kinds

    of visitors to the Sites and how those visitors use the Sites in order to serve advertisements to you

    on our Sites or other sites with which we have a business relationship. We may also aggregate on

    an anonymous basis data regarding job qualifications, schooling, age, experience level or other

    information relevant to the job search or competition among job seekers for any such job. Such

    aggregated data does not identify users individually, and may be made available to employers or

    fellow job seekers or community members. We disclose information to companies and

    individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting our web

    servers, data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing

    customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to your personal

    information as may necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information

    with any other third party.
</p>

<u>Resume Sharing</u>
<p>waytogulf offers you the service of putting your resume on our database.</p>
<p>
    When you create or post a resume to the Sites, that resume is stored in our searchable resume

    database in India. You may control the status of your resume by setting it to private or public. If you set your resume as private, it is not searchable by potential employers or other with access

    to our resume database. You may still use your resume to apply online to a job. If you do apply

    online to a job, your resume will be transferred to the relevant employer, who may retain a copy

    of your resume or distribute it to third parties. We cannot control their use or retention of your

    resume information.

</p>
<p>
    If you set your resume as public, but want your contact information to be confidential, your

    resume will be searchable by potential employers, but we will hide your contact information and

    current company. You must also remove your contact information from your uploaded or copy

    and paste text resume. You should be aware that if you have a rare skill or job title, for example,

    it may still be possible for you to be identified even without your contact details being included.

    If you are worried about being identified, you should not include specific details by which you

    could be identified. If you use a confidential resume to apply to a job online, the employer to

    whom you send your resume will be able to view your contact information in order to contact

    you about your application.
</p>
<h2>Use of Cookies, Web Beacons and Javascript</h2>
<u>Cookies</u>
<p>
    Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. Some cookies and

    other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Web user.

    Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet

    protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and

    dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies

    allows us to improve our Web site and your Web experience. We may also analyze information

    that does not contain Personal Information for trends and statistics.
</p>
<u>Web Beacons</u>
<p>
    waytogulf Web pages also utilize electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called

    single-pixel gifs, clear gifs or action tags) that allow us to collect certain information about user

    visits to these Web pages (including the number of users who have visited those pages), measure

    and improve the effectiveness of advertisements and job postings, and deliver co-branded

    services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information; they are a

    technique used to compile aggregated statistics about website usage. Web beacons collect only a

    limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of page view and a

    description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. This information may be shared with

    third party processors for processing on behalf of waytogulf, as well as with clients, partners, and

    other third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the Web pages, how those

    visitors use those Web Pages, and the effectiveness of their advertisements and job postings.
</p>
<p>Web Beacons and Cookies can be opted out of by changing the cookie setup in your browser.</p>

<u>Javascript</u>
<p>
    waytogulf also uses JavaScript, for example, within certain advertisements. JavaScript is a script

    language that enhances the functionality of websites, particularly in respect to pictures. We are not collecting any personal data via JavaScript but use it to inform employers about how many

    applicants have clicked on email addresses embedded in their job ads, for example. You may

    deactivate JavaScript via your browser settings or activate it the same way.
</p>
<p>
    waytogulf welcomes your comments regarding this privacy statement at the contact address given

    at the website. Should there be any concerns about contravention of this Privacy Policy, waytogulf

    will employ all commercially reasonable efforts to address the same. Any feedback that is

    submitted through this area becomes the property of waytogulf. We may use this feedback at any

    time for any purposes, such as success stories for marketing purposes, or to contact you for

    further feedback on the Web Site.
</p>
<h2>Important Information</h2>
<u>Account Security</u>
<p>
    You are responsible for ensuring that your log-in credentials (your username and password) are

    kept confidential.
</p>
<p>
    waytogulf has implemented technical and organizational measures designed to secure your

    personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or

    disclosure. Notwithstanding such measures, the Internet is an open system and we cannot

    guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat those measures or use your

    personal information for improper purposes. Moreover, one of our primary purposes is to

    provide you with a platform to broadcast the information in your resume and profile widely in

    order to maximize your career opportunities. Such an environment does present a risk that

    unauthorized third parties will view this data, so you should refer to our Security Center for

    additional information on conducting a safe job search. Further, your resume should not contain

    any sensitive data that you would not want made public. You should be aware that resumes may

    be monitored by your current employer.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, as stated earlier, we also use cookies, web beacons, and Java Script to administer

    our site and deliver a personalized experience.
