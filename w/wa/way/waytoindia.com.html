<span class="blue-heading">II. CHOICE/OPT-OUT</span>
<p>Cookies are small data files placed on your hard drive by a website server when you visit. We may use cookies for tracking purposes or to make our Website easier to use. Cookies are currently the only way to effectively identify a unique anonymous visitor and understand how they navigate our web site. An anonymous visitor to our site remains anonymous in all cases. We do not attempt to identify visitors if they do not voluntarily submit personal information to us. With most internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Cookies offer enhanced functionality to the user, but whether you allow a cookie to be placed on your computer is up to you! In some instances, we may use tracking scripts or "tracers" that recognize a unique identifier from a cookie placed on your hard drive by another website. These are used by us solely to gauge the success of our own advertising. For instance, we may use a tracer to determine whether you visit our employment pages after visiting a resume or career site where we placed a banner ad. We do not use tracers to gather information on your use of the internet unrelated to us. We may also use your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, which is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, such as your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university, to help diagnose problems with our server, gather broad demographic information, serve you more relevant offers and administer our Website. Please note that we do not use tracers to identify your personal information, and you remain anonymous unless and until you choose to identify yourself. </p>

<span class="blue-heading">IV. SECURITY</span>
<p>We do not treat your general interaction with Comfort Connections (e.g., submission of suggestions) as confidential. Any information you submit will be treated as non- confidential. Note that most internet browsers also offer security alerts that permit you to determine whether your transmissions are protected. </p>
