This is a legal document which sets out how Where Are You Now? handles data which identifies you. This Privacy Policy forms part of our Term and Conditions.
At Where Are You Now?, we believe strongly in protecting the privacy of our Members’ personal information. This statement describes the privacy practices we apply for the WAYN Service. As part of that, it also expresses our approach to complying with the data protection laws which apply in the United Kingdom. 
If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact Where Are You Now?'s customer services at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@wayn.com">dataprotection@wayn.com</a>. 
<br><br>

1. <b>The information we gather and track.</b><br><br>

Information gathered on registration. When you register for the WAYN Service, you provide your name, your email address, your gender, your date of birth, nationality, your location details and some optional details about yourself ("Registration Information"). They are available to you, and capable of being corrected or updated, through the "Profile" page.  <br><br>

Cookies. We use small files known as "cookies" to enhance users’ experience of the Where Are You Now? Service as follows: <br><br>

To hold Members’ login information, so that your location details and contact information are displayed when you visit the WAYN Service. This option can be disabled by clicking the “logoff" icon which appears at the top right hand corner of every page.<br><br>

To facilitate optimal use of the WAYN Service by Members, by means of a temporary "session" cookie. These cookies disappear when the Member’s browser session ends, or if the Member clicks the "logoff" icon which appears on the WAYN Service.<br><br>


<u>Third Party Advertising </u><br><br>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click here.<br><br>

<u>Third Party Cookies</u><br>
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, a third-party advertiser may place or recognise a unique “cookie" on your browser.<br><br>

2. <b>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
If your personally identifiable information or email address changes, or if you no longer wish to be a Member of the WAYN Service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate your Membership through the "Settings" or "VIP Settings" toolbar menu option found at the top of most pages when logged on to the WAYN service. 
Alternatively, you can email WAYN Customer Support at the following email: <a href="mailto:support@wayn.com">support@wayn.com</a> or by mail to: Where Are You Now Ltd, London BIC, Electric Avenue, Enfield, EN3 7XU, United Kingdom, or by telephone during normal office hours of 9am to 5pm GMT Monday to Friday on: 0871 700 700 1. 
We will endeavour to respond to all email enquires within 2 working days.
<br><br>

3. <b>Choice / Opt-Out</b><br>
We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, when you register to WAYN as a Standard Member but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our registration form. <br><br>

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at: support@wayn.com with your request. We offer an opportunity to opt-out of certain communications on our "Privacy preferences", which can be accessed from the "Settings" or "VIP Settings" toolbar menu option found at the top of most pages when logged on to the WAYN service. Alternatively, you may contact us by telephone during normal office hours of 9am to 5pm GMT Monday to Friday on: 0871 700 700 1, via email at: support@wayn.com or by mail to: Where Are You Now Ltd, London BIC, Electric Avenue, Enfield, EN3 7XU, United Kingdom to opt-out.<br><br>

Please note that there are some emails that we will need to send you as a core part of the WAYN Service.  These emails are an integral part of the service we offer: if you do not wish to receive them, then it will be necessary to deregister completely, and cease to be a Member of the WAYN Service.  These are the relevant emails:<br><br>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
	<li>the WAYN Monthly Newsletter</li>
	<li>an Account summary email, sent every two weeks, providing some of the following information (and where applicable): “number of unread messages, new registrations in the member’s current location..."</li>
	<li>a Location email, also sent every two weeks, providing some of the following information: “number of members coming to the subscriber’s home location, number of members planning a trip at the same date and location as the subscriber..."</li>
</ul>

4. <b>Sharing and use of information </b><br><br>

The over-riding principles we apply are these: <br><br>

We, and (where relevant) our credit card processing agents, will not supply your personal data to a third party for commercial exploitation except as consented to by you in accordance with prevailing law. <br><br>

Registration Information. Once a Member selects a location, some or all of the information held for that Member, except for the email address and mobile/cell phone number and passwords, will be publicly available at the listing for that location. <br><br>

Your home location, and any other location specific information you submit to the WAYN Service must be considered at all times to be publicly available information, save where the option to keep private such information is available and activated by the Member.<br><br>

Email addresses. We do not directly make your email address available to anyone on any screen of the WAYN Service. The only legitimate way of making contact with a person found on the WAYN Service is for a Full Member to enter a message which we will send on the Member’s behalf. The email sent will include the sending Full Member’s email address so that the recipient can respond to the sender directly. This means by sending a contact message, the sending Member is disclosing his/her email address. Members may change their email address at any time through their Personal Details. If your email system automatically responds to a contact email with a read or delivery receipt, your email address will be revealed. <br><br>

Un-verified Memberships. If you register for the WAYN Service, but fail to validate your Membership then we may contact you via email at periods of 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days at your registered email address to notify you of the invalid status. Should you fail to respond to these notifications then we will send you one final notice before the un-validated Membership is removed. <br><br>

Advertising. The WAYN Service may include interactive advertising for other businesses. We may use, and provide to third parties, anonymous demographic data provided by Members to target this advertising more appropriately. <br><br>

Telephone numbers. You may enter a contact telephone number in your Personal Details. This number is for internal use only, for future or current services such as SMS. Your number will never be disclosed to any third party without your prior consent. Should we introduce a service which utilises telephone numbers, you will be given the option to agree to this, as we believe it should be your choice what services you receive. <br><br>

Newsletters. We have regular and occasional emails, which Members can decide to take or not, according to their preferences. This option is selected through your Profile page. <br><br>

Notification of unread messages. If you have a number of messages waiting for you in your WAYN mailbox, and you have not logged in to the service for an extended period, we may at our discretion contact you via your registered email address to notify you of the unread messages. Should you still not read and remove these messages then we may remove the messages as part of our data cleansing process. <br><br>

Credit Card information. There has been a lot of publicity about Credit Card security on the Internet so we decided to use Worldpay plc, who operate a secure server, to process our credit card payments. They encrypt Members’ credit or debit card information and authorise payment directly. This means that Members’ credit card details are never revealed to us. Worldpay plc may transfer to, process and hold your credit card information in countries either within or outside the European Economic Area in connection with performing their duties and you should satisfy yourself as to the terms of their Privacy Policy. <br><br>

Companies in the WAYN group in an aggregated, de-personalised form. We may share data supplied by you (or collected about you) with our subsidiaries and other companies in our group, but only for the purposes described in this policy. <br><br>

Changes in WAYN’s business. If all of the assets which WAYN uses to operate its business (or substantially all of them) are acquired by a third party, we may transfer personal data we then hold to that party. <br><br>

Place of processing. The personal information held by us is held on and processed by computers situated in the United Kingdom.<br><br>

5. <b>Security</b> <br><br>

We have security measures in place to protect our customer database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains each Member’s responsibility: <br><br>

to protect against unauthorised access to Your Details; <br>
to ensure against use by anyone else of the WAYN Service through the machine that Member uses while they are "logged on" to the WAYN Service; <br>
to log off or exit from the WAYN Service when not using it; and <br>
to keep his/her password secret. <br>

6. <b>Remove details</b> <br><br>

You may have your registration details removed at any time. To remove yourself, please click <a href="wayn.html?wci=unregister">here</a> to view instructions on the removal process. <br><br>

7. <b>Invite a Friend</b><br><br>

If Members elect to permit WAYN to search email addresses held within their email service, they accept that by doing so, an email invitation will be sent on their behalf, to the relevant email address,  and that from time to time a reminder email could be sent to that contact. By inviting their contacts to join the site, the Member agrees that they have obtained prior consent from their contacts (a) to send them such an invitation and reminder, and (b) to allow the other action referred to in this Clause 8. WAYN stores the name and email address of the contacts for the purpose of automatically adding the respondent to the contacts list of the Member sending the invitation and to send reminders of the invitation on the Member’s behalf. The Members' username and password will not be saved anywhere on the site. The names of the contacts being uploaded will also be searcheable via the name search facility to enable other WAYN Members to find old contacts. Other WAYN Members will be able to send an anonymous email to the Member who uploaded the contact name being searched, with a description of the person they are trying to get back in touch with, enabling the Member who uploaded the contact to potentially connect the two people together. WAYN does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. The Member or the Member’s contacts can request the removal of their details from our database by sending an email to ,a href="mailto:remove@wayn.com"&gt;remove@wayn.com. <br><br>

8. <b>Uploading your Contacts</b><br><br>

If a user elects to upload their contacts, they accept that by doing so, an email invitation will be sent on their behalf, to the email addresses of the contacts that are being uploaded and that from time to time, a reminder email could be sent to that contact. By inviting their contacts to join the site, the user agrees that they have obtained prior consent from their friends to send them an invitation. WAYN stores the name and email address of the contacts for the purpose of automatically adding the respondent to the friends list of the user sending the invitation and to send reminders of the invitation on the user’s behalf. The users' username and password will not be saved anywhere on the site. The names of the contacts being uploaded will also be searcheable via the name search facility to enable other WAYN users to find old friends. Other WAYN users will be able to send an anonymous email to the user who uploaded the contact name being searched, with a description of the person they are trying to get back in touch with, enabling the user who uploaded the contact to potentially connect the two people together. WAYN does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. The user or the users' contacts can request the removal of their details from our database by sending an email to remove@wayn.com. <br><br>

9. <b>Disclosure for legal reasons</b><br><br>

We reserve the right to communicate such of a Member’s personal information as we hold to third parties which seek the disclosure of it, and which make a legally-compliant request for its disclosure.<br><br>

10. <b>Contacting Where Are You Now?</b><br><br>

You can also use this address if you wish to request from Where Are You Now? a copy of the personal data we hold about you or a description of that data. Please note that by English law we are entitled to charge you a small sum for providing this information. <br><br>

11. <b>Links to third party sites</b><br><br>

Our site contains links to other sites. Where Are You Now? is not responsible for the privacy practices, or the content, of those web sites.<br><br>

12. <b>Data Protection Information</b><br><br>

You can obtain further information about data protection laws by visiting the Information Commissioner’s website at www.dataprotection.gov.uk. You can search for our Data Protection Notification there if you wish.<br><br>

13. <b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b><br><br>

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy or email practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
