Sharing and use of information </span></b></p><p><span>Any visitor to the WAYN Service anywhere in the world can view your profile
information and photos that you have uploaded to the WAYN.com community. You
can control what part of your profile information and photos is visible to
visitors of the WAYN.com website and which network of WAYN.com members can see
what information. </span></p><p><span>The over-riding principles we apply are these: </span></p><p><span>We, and (where relevant) our credit card processing agents, will not supply your
personal data to a third party for commercial exploitation except as consented
to by you in accordance with prevailing law. </span></p><p><b><span>Profile Information</span></b>. Once a Member selects a location, some or all of the information
held for that Member, except for the email address, telephone numbers and
passwords, will be publicly available at the listing for that location. </p><p><span>Your home location, in terms of your town / city, state / county and country, and any
other location specific information you submit to the WAYN Service must be
considered at all times to be publicly available information, save where you
specify (in the Privacy options that apply to your profile) that you wish your
profile only to be viewable by either Members or friends. In addition, if
address details are submitted to the WAYN.com service they are not made
publicly available. </span></p><p><b><span>Email addresses</span></b><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:&quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black">. We do not directly make your email address available to anyone
on any screen of the WAYN Service. Similarly, when you send an email to another
Member through the WAYN Service, neither the sender's nor the recipient's email
address is disclosed by the WAYN Service itself. Members can, however, choose
to make their email addresses known to other Members; however, WAYN does not
recommend that you do so, and any such disclosure is at the Member's own risk.
Members may change the email address we hold them at any time by visiting
"Edit Personal Details", which is accessible from the Member's
account settings found at the top of most pages when logged on to the WAYN
Service. If your email system automatically responds to a contact email with a
read or delivery receipt, your email address will be revealed. No tracking
technologies are used within / in conjunction with emails nor do we share,
sell, rent or trade PII with third parties for their promotional purposes. </span></p><p><b><span>Un-validated Memberships.</span></b><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:&quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black"> If you register for the WAYN Service, and you receive a
validation email, but fail to validate your Membership then we may contact you
via email at periods of 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days at your registered email
address to notify you of the invalid status. Should you fail to respond to
these notifications then we may send you one final notice before the
un-validated Membership is removed.</span></p><p><b><span>Advertising.</span></b> The WAYN
Service may include interactive advertising for other businesses.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads and collect information when you visit
the WAYN website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email
address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide
advertisements on the WAYN website, other websites and other forms of media about goods and
services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know
your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here:

This number is for internal use only, for future or current services such as
SMS. Your number will never be disclosed to any third party without your prior
consent. Should we introduce an additional service which utilises telephone
numbers, or we wish to provide you with informational content via your mobile
phone, you will be given the option to agree to this, as we believe it should
be your choice what services you receive.</p><p><b><span>Notification
of unread messages.</span></b><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:&quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black"> If you have a number of messages waiting for you in your WAYN
mailbox, and you have not logged in to the service for an extended period, we
may at our discretion contact you via your registered email address to notify
you of the unread messages. Should you still not read and remove these messages
then we may remove the messages as part of our data cleansing process. </span></p><p><b><span>Credit
Card information.</span></b><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:&quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;

the Internet so we work with the leading Merchant Providers in the industry who
specialize in Fraud and Data Verification. These companies include Protx and
Meta Charge. Members' credit or debit card information is encrypted and stored
securely. We share your billing information with such companies insofar as
necessary for the processing of your payment or to prevent or detect fraud.
These companies have agreed not to retain, share, store or use your personally

Sharing Information </span></b></p><p><span>When you
use the WAYN Service, you may form relationships, send messages, perform
searches and queries, form groups, set up events, and transmit information
through various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide
you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so
that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or
easily see your friend list. [When you update information, we usually keep a
backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable
reversion to the prior version of that information. You post a User Submission
(as defined in the WAYN Terms and Conditions) on the WAYN Service at your own
risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your
pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share
your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User
Submissions you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We
are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security
measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after
removal, copies of User Submissions may remain viewable in cached and archived
pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Submissions. </span></p><p><span>Where Are
You Now? Ltd may also collect information about you from other sources, such as
newspapers, blogs, instant messaging services, and other users of the WAYN.com
service through the operation of the service (e.g. photo tags) in order to
provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience. </span></p><p><span>When you
register for the WAYN Service, you can create your own profile and determine
your own privacy settings. </span></p><p><span>Your name
and profile picture thumbnail will be available in all search results across
the WAYN.com network and may be searchable through third party web-sites with
which we partner (such as sites for which we provide a social network service)
and third party search engines, and may be automatically notified to third
party tracking websites/weblogs; in each case, you can prevent this happening
by specifying (in the Privacy options that apply to your profile) that you wish
your profile only to be viewable by either Members or friends. </span></p><p><span>The fact
that your WAYN profile has been added or updated, as well as a short extract
from the title page of your WAYN profile, may be automatically notified to
third party tracking websites/weblogs (thus increasing the traffic to the WAYN
Service, and potentially to your own WAYN profile). This can also be prevented
by specifying (in the Privacy options) that you wish your profile only to be
viewable by either Members or friends. If you do so, this will prevent
subsequent notifications to third party tracking websites/weblogs, but
notifications prior to the time when you make the change to your profile's
Privacy options may continue to appear on those websites/weblogs. </span></p><p><span>Your news
feeds and friends feeds may aggregate the information you provide and make it
available to your friends and network members according to your privacy
settings. You may set your preferences for your news feeds at any time by
adjusting your Privacy Settings. </span></p><p><b><span>7.
