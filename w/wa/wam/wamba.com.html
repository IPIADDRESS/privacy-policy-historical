PRIVACY POLICY<br><br></p>


<strong>Privacy policy</strong><br><br>

Wamba Project S.L., domiciled in Palma de Mallorca, Avenida Jaume III, 5, 4th B, with CIF Nº B57425399, is in charge of the Wamba.com website, whose purpose is offering online services aimed to help the User to communicate with other users, creating a contact network, as well as offering the User a space in Internet where to publish personal information, interests and hobbies. The information provided by Users about themselves shall serve as a way of identification.  <br><br>

We are very interested in protecting the Users’ personal details and through this Privacy Policy we aim to explain how said details are dealt with.<br><br>

Wamba reserves the right to modify this privacy policy in order for it to adapt to legal and/or jurisprudential changes. In that case, modifications shall be announced through this page in advance and before they come into force. The use of our services once said modifications are announced shall imply their acceptance.<br><br>


<strong>Applicable legislation</strong><br><br>

Wamba abides by the legislation in force in Spain and the European Union, specifically, by the General Law of Data Protection and complementary regulations, concerning Users’ personal details. For that reason, Wamba has taken the necessary technical and administrative measures to prevent the loss, misuse, alteration, non-authorized access and thief of the personal data obtained, taking into account the state of technology, the nature of the data and the risks they are exposed to. <br><br>


<strong>Security</strong><br><br>

Wamba has adopted the security levels for the protection of personal data required by the Security Measures Regulations for automatic files that contain personal information (Royal Decree 994/1999). Moreover, Wamba has attempted to use any other means and take additional technical measures to avoid the loss, misuse, alteration, non-authorized access and theft of the personal data obtained.<br><br>

Nevertheless, any data transference through Internet is in risk of being intercepted. Wamba cannot assure that this will not happen, and therefore Wamba shall not be liable if this happened.<br><br>

During the registration process, the User will be asked to choose a password. The User is solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password, as well as for any actions that might take place during the time his/her username and password are used to log in the site. The User undertakes to notify Wamba as soon as possible in case of non-authorized use of his/her username and password or any other security failure. Wamba shall not be liable for any damages or losses caused by the non-compliance of this obligation.<br><br>          
<br><br>


<strong>Data collection</strong><br><br>

Wamba shall use the personal information collected for the sole purpose of providing the services requested by the Users and sending them notifications concerning such services and a newsletter with information and news that Wamba may consider relevant.
Those Users that do not wish to receive said newsletters, shall indicate so in the Registration Form. However, Users will not be able to choose not to receive other notifications sent by Wamba, since said notifications are necessary for the maintenance of the service.<br><br>

Wamba shall not share the Users’ personal information with third parties without their previous consent.<br><br>

The data collected shall be added to a personal information file duly registered with the Data Protection Spanish Agency. The sending of personal information implies the User’s tacit acceptance of his/her inclusion in the file.<br><br>

Registration: in order to become a User of Wamba, the User must create an account in the website. With that purpose, the User shall provide the following information: name, email address, address, age, username and password.<br><br>

Profile: once registered, the User may provide additional information, including interests, hobbies, photographs, etc. Providing such information is voluntary, but it will allow Users to widen their contact network. However, Users should be aware that the information included in their profiles might be seen by several other Users.<br><br>

Information about contacts: in order to invite others to join Wamba, Users shall enter their names and emails. Said information shall be used by Wamba to send invitations, which shall include a message written by the User. This information shall only be used for sending an invitation.<br><br>

All the information entered by the User about his/her contacts, shall be protected pursuant to this privacy policy.<br><br>

Wamba has hired the hosting services of Eve1Servers, based in the United States; as well as the IT outsourcing services of SX Networks, based in Uruguay. Said companies are in charge of all the personal data. Therefore, the transference of such information to them is necessary for the proper functioning of the service. By accepting this privacy policy, you accept tacitly the sending of your personal data to the aforementioned companies. Wamba shall change its providers in the future, informing its Users about the identity of the new companies in charge of the personal information.
<br><br>

<strong>IP addresses and cookies</strong><br><br>

Due to the currently existing Internet communication protocols, whenever the User visits our website, Wamba automatically detects the IP (Internet Protocol) address allocated by the Access Provider.

Wamba may use cookies whenever a user is surfing its websites and web pages. Said cookies are only linked to the browser of a specific computer (an anonymous user), and do not provide the user’s personal information by themselves. Cookies are only used for internal purposes, such as access statistics for the website. The cookies used cannot read the cookie files created by other providers or websites. The User may change the settings of his/her computer so as to be informed of the sending of cookies and prevent the installation of cookies in his/her hard drive. The User may read the instructions and guidebooks of his/her browser in order to obtain more information.<br><br>


<strong>Links</strong><br><br>

This website contains links to other websites. The User should be aware that Wamba shall not be liable for other websites’ privacy policies. We remind users that by using one of said links they are leaving our website and they should read the privacy policies included in other websites that collect personal information. <br><br>

The privacy policy included in this document shall only apply to the personal information collected by this website.<br><br>


<strong>Registration modification and cancellation</strong><br><br>

Those Users who want to modify their personal data, or do not wish to make use of our services anymore by canceling their registration, may correct, update or delete their personal information in the Registration Area.<br><br>
