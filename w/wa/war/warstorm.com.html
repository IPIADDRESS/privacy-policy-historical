			During the last Great War between the empires of Machan and Aseti, the southern continent of Phyrras became a point of fierce contention. Claimed by both sides, Phyrras became a vast battleground. As word of these Duels reached across time and space, the city of Phyrra became the center of grand martial competition.

Accordingly we want you to understand what types of information we are 
collecting and what may happen to that information.  </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">This Privacy Policy details 
how we safeguard the privacy of our on-line users and does not apply 
to information that may be collected by us off-line. This Privacy Policy 
is incorporated into and is subject to the Challenge Games' Terms 
of Use. Your use of the Games and any personal information you provide 
through the Websites remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy 
and our Terms of Use.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">WHAT YOU WILL FIND IN THIS 
PRIVACY POLICY</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">    * How we 
collect information about you</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">    * How we 
use or share information about you</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">    * How we

</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Information is collected from 
our users at several different points during your use of the Games.  
In general, information is collected in connection with the purchase 
of goods or services though our on-line stores, surveys, newsletters, 
user registrations, services, warranties, contests or for on-line game 
participation, message boards, and complaints or third party communications 
we may receive regarding our users.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Registration. To use some resources 
available through the Websites, a user must complete our registration 
process. During registration, a user is required to provide certain 
categories of information, which may include a name, address, e-mail 
address, and a password.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Optional Information. At various 
other points during your use of the Websites, you may be asked to provide 
information about yourself. For example, you may wish to participate 
in a survey or a contest. Participation in surveys or contests or the 
use of other services which require the input of additional information 
is completely voluntary on your part, and you have the choice about 
whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features 
of our site.  Users purchasing products or services through our 
on-line stores will be required to provide additional information such 
as a valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing 
addresses.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Passive Collection of Information. 
In addition to the information which you actively provide to us by methods 
such as completing the registration form, we collect information about 
how you interact with the Websites. We collect passive information for 
purposes such as testing and improving a user's experience with the 
Websites and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and 
related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to 
third parties such as advertisers and content partners. The types of 
passive information collected by this site include, without limitation, 
your IP address, which type of browser you are using, where you go within 
the Games and your behavior within the Games.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Cookies. When you visit the 
Websites, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing 
a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely 
identifies your browser. We use both session cookies and persistent 
cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent 
cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Websites. 
Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help 
file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after 
you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all 
cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features 
of the Websites may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies 
is disabled.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Collection of Information from 
Children. Challenge Games abides by federal law and the guidelines set 
up by the Federal Trade Commission regarding youth privacy (Children's 
Online Privacy Protection Act). As such, we will not knowingly collect 
any personal information from or allow the registration of young people 
under the age of 13. If Challenge Games obtains knowledge that it has 
personally identifiable information about a child under 13 in retrievable 
form in its files, Challenge Games will delete that information from 
its existing files.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">USE / SHARING OF INFORMATION</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">We may use your information 
in order to deliver products and services to you and to customize the 
Games to your interests and enhance your overall experience with the 
Games. We try to recognize you using various methods, including having 
you log in with your user name and your password. Once we recognize 
you, advertisements and other content may be customized for you so that 
you can see what interests you the most. In addition, as described above, 
we utilize passive information to learn more about how you interact 
with the Games. This passive information may be combined with your other 
information for purposes such as testing and improving your experience 
at our site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data 
and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure 
to third parties such as advertisers and content partners. This aggregate 
passive information does not contain any personal information that can 
identify any individual user.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">We may use your contact information 
periodically in order to send you e-mail regarding updates to the Games 
and to alert you or remind you of happenings related to the Games. The 
frequency of these messages will vary depending upon various factors.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">We will not knowingly sell, 
share, rent or otherwise transfer your information other than in accordance 
with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy. We do not share any 
information that can be tied to you without your permission. If you 
give your permission to allow third parties to contact you, personal 
information about you (such as your contact information and other information 
collected during your visit to the Websites) may be shared with data 
aggregators, marketers (possibly in the form of list rental), and other 
organizations. Regardless of your decision regarding the sharing of 
your personal information, we may share broad aggregate demographic 
data and related usage information with our business partners. This 
aggregate information does not contain any personal information that 
can identify any individual user.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">If you purchase a product or 
service at our site, we will also ask for your credit card number or 
other account number you wish to be charged.  We do not give out 
your credit card or other account informatio</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">n 
to third parties unless you authorize us to do so or if it is necessary 
to fulfill our responsibilities, including, but not limited to, delivering 
a product or service you order.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">From time to time, we may decide 
that it is more efficient to use third parties to perform specific services, 
such as sending communications to our users. If we use a third party 
to provide specific services (such as sending communications to our 
users on our behalf), then information (such as contact information) 
may be shared with that party to the extent necessary for the third 
party to provide these services. These third party service providers 
are only allowed to use personally identifiable information for the 
purpose of providing the specific services requested by us. The third 
party services covered by this paragraph do not include links to third 
party sites found on our Websites, which are governed by a more specific 
provision below.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">While we strive to protect 
the personal information of our users, Challenge Games reserves the 
right at all times to disclose information where required by law or 
to comply with valid legal process (such as a search warrant, subpoena 
or court order), to protect Challenge Game's rights or property, including 
without limitation in the event of a transfer of control of Challenge 
Games or substantially all of its assets, or during emergencies when 
safety is at risk.  </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Our sites may also have message 
boards or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate 
with one another. When posting to a message board or chat area, please 
be aware that the information is being made publicly available on-line 
and any user does so at his or her own risk.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">SECURITY</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">We have security measures in 
place to help protect against the loss, misuse and/or unauthorized alteration 
of the information under our control. You are the only user authorized 
to update your profile, unless you provide your password information 
to another party.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">We utilize both online and 
offline security methods, including firewalls, passwords and restricted 
physical access to the places where your information is stored to help 
protect personally identifiable information. Our staff is trained to 
comply with our security procedures, and our security procedures are 
regularly reviewed and revised, if necessary, by our privacy team. <i> </i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">If you have any questions about 
security issues at our site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@challengegames.com" target="_blank">support@challengegames.com</a> 
and we will try to answer your questions.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">OTHER PROVISIONS</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Games are hosted in the 
United States and are intended for and directed to users in the United 
States. If you are a user accessing the Websites from the European Union, 
Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal 
data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States 
laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Websites, 
which are governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Notice, and our Terms of 
Use, you are transferring your personal information to the United States 
and you consent to that transfer.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Your use of the Websites indicates 
an acceptance of the terms of the Privacy Policy. We reserve the right 
to update or amend this Privacy Policy at any time.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">In the event that we sell, 
assign or transfer some or all of our business to a successor or acquirer, 
we may sell, assign or transfer all of your information, regardless 
of your opt status, to such successor or acquirer.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Websites may contain links 
to other third party sites, applications or content. Please be aware 
that we do not exercise control over the information, applications, 
products, services or policies of third parties accessible through the 
Websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave the Websites 
and to read the privacy policies of each and every third party that 
may be providing sites, applications or content linked to the Websites.  
This Privacy Policy applies solely to the information collected by us 
on-line through the Websites.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The State of California enacted 
the "Shine the Light" law (CA Civil Code Sec 198.83) that permits 
users who are California residents to request certain information regarding 
the disclosure of personal information during the past year for marketing 
purposes. To make such a request, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@challengegames.com" target="_blank">legal@challengegames.com</a>.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Your privacy is important to 
us. If you have questions about any of the provisions described above,
