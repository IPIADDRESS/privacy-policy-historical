In general, information is collected in connection with the purchase of goods or services though our on-line stores, surveys, newsletters, user registrations for products, services, warranties, contests or for on-line game participation, message boards, and complaints or third party communications we may receive regarding our users.
		<br><br>
		Registration. To use some resources available through Warstorm, a user must complete our registration process. During registration, a user is required to provide certain categories of information, which may include a name, address, e-mail address, and a password.
		<br><br>
		Optional Information. At various other points during your use of Warstorm, you may be asked to provide information about yourself. For example, you may wish to participate in a survey or a contest. Participation in surveys or contests or the use of other services which require the input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part, and you have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of our site.  Users purchasing products or services through our on-line stores will be required to provide additional information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing addresses.
		<br><br>
		Passive Collection of Information. In addition to the information which you actively provide to us by methods such as completing the registration form, we collect information about how you interact with Warstorm. We collect passive information for purposes such as testing and improving a user's experience with Warstorm and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners. The types of passive information collected by this site include, without limitation, your IP address, which type of browser you are using, where you go within Warstorm and your behavior within Warstorm.

		Cookies. When you visit the Site, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
