		<p><strong>OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to a website, domain or mobile application owned by Red Frog Events, its agents, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively, “RFE,” “we,” and/or “us”) that features RFE or one of our events or services. This Privacy Policy applies to our websites, domains, mobile applications (collectively, the “Services”). RFE makes the Services available for your use subject to all applicable terms and conditions contained in in our Terms of Service and in this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Terms”). The Terms may change from time to time and changes are effective upon posting, so it is your responsibility to check back and review the Terms.</p>
<p>Please read the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using the Services, including, without limitation, visiting our websites, registering for our events, signing up for contests or sweepstakes, participating in surveys, submitting comments or content, you expressly acknowledge that you have read and agree to be bound by the Terms and any applicable local laws. You waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of the Terms and the lack of signature by the parties. If you do not agree to the Terms, please stop using the Services immediately.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy will help you understand what information we collect, how we use the information, how we share the information, and the choices you may have with respect to the information we collect. Please contact us at info@redfrogevents.com if you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You may opt out of receiving our emails by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in any email you receive from us or by contacting us (see the “Contact Us” section at the end of this policy). Note, however, that if you opt out of receiving emails related to your current event registrations, you may miss important information or changes relating to the event, for which RFE assumes no responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We collect information from you in several different ways, including:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Information You Provide To Us Or Give Us Permission To Obtain</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you provide it to us voluntarily by creating an online account, commenting on a message board, registering for an event, signing up to receive our emails, contacting our customer service team, participating in a sweepstakes, contest or survey, donating to one of our charity partners, applying for a job or otherwise communicating with us.</p>
<p>You also may give us permission to access your information on third party social media sites. For example, you may link your Facebook or Twitter account to our websites, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to keep those updated with your preferred settings.</p>
<p>The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, phone number, zip code, billing address, and any other information you choose to provide.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Information We Collect Automatically</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We automatically collect certain information when you access the Services or transact business with us, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transaction Information:</strong> When you register for one of our events or services, we collect information about the transaction, such as contact information, registration details and the date and time of the registration.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log Data: </strong>When you access the Services, our servers automatically record certain data (“Log Data”). Log Data we collect includes, but may not be limited to, Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, browser type, characteristics of your device and software, domain names of your Internet Service Provider, your approximate geographic location, a record of your usage of the Services, the time of your usage, the referring link through which you accessed the Services and aggregated personal data that cannot be used to specifically identify you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Device Data:</strong> In addition to Log Data, we may also collect information about the device you use to access our sites (“Device Data”), including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you are using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please consult the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email Communications:</strong> When you open emails from us, we may receive a confirmation noting you opened the email (if your computer supports such capabilities). We may also keep track of what emails we send you and what emails you may be receiving from our affiliates (if any).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information Collected by Cookies, Pixels and Other Tracking Technologies:</strong></li>
<li>Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored as text files by your Internet browser on your computer, mobile phone or other device. Most Internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies. We use cookies to track user traffic patterns. You can set your browser to refuse cookies from websites or to remove cookies from your hard drive, but, if you do, you will not be able to access or use portions of our websites such as message boards, forums, contests and surveys.</li>
<li>Web beacons or tracking pixels are small blocks of code on webpages that do things like allow another server to measure viewing of a webpage; they are often used in connection with cookies.</li>
<li>We may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels and other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you interact with our websites or emails, including information about your browsing or registration behavior.</li>
<li>We may combine this information with other information we collect about you and use it for various purposes, such as improving the Services and your online experience, understanding which areas and features of our sites are popular, counting visits, understanding campaign effectiveness, tailoring our communications with you, determining whether an email has been opened and links within the email have been clicked and for other internal business purposes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong>
<ul>
<li>We use a tool called <u><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a></u>&nbsp;to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your Web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the <u><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">Google Analytics Terms of Use</a></u>&nbsp;and the <u><a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a></u>. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Information We Collect From Sponsors, Partners And Other Sources</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect about you. For example, our event sponsors may track visitors to their websites who clicked on a link in an email sent by us and they may share the aggregated data with us.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION USE</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Internal Use</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<p>We use your personal information to process your registration and provide you with the above-and-beyond customer service for which we are known. We use your personal information to organize and administer events and, if applicable, to provide results from events. In addition, in our constant effort to seek bottlenecks, we may use your personal information to improve the Services, to improve our marketing efforts directed at new and existing customers and to determine general information about visitors to our websites or applications.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Communications With You:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We use your personal information to communicate with you about your events (either those for which you have registered or those which you have created), such as to send you a confirmation email when you register for an event and updates relating to that specific event. Also, you may submit your email address to us for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: registering for a sweepstakes, contest or survey; requesting that we notify you of new brands, events or products; signing up for newsletters and special offers.
