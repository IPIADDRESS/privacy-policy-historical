<p><strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong><br> To open  your Moneybookers Account, we need to obtain certain personal  information from you, such as your full name, address, email, phone  number and your date of birth. For certain optional transactions, we  also collect financial information such as credit or debit card details.  For certain high value transactions, we may be required to report  personal information to the relevant authorities. For verification  purposes we reserve the right to request proof of your identity and  proof of address. When using our services, your IP address and login  times are recorded and stored for purposes of preventing fraud and  enhancing the security of our services. We may also collect usage and  access data that allows us to prevent multiple account openings or other  fraudulent behaviour or to protect our systems against illegal attacks  or abuse. Strictly for this purpose, we may share such data with  specialized and trustworthy fraud management services that help us  analyse the data. We may also use cookies. A cookie is a small text file  that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes.  Information collected and stored through cookies may be matched against  the personal data we hold on our systems.  When you send money to a user that is not yet registered with  Moneybookers, we will store that user’s email address for at least  fourteen days during which time the user can collect the funds. If the  user does not register for Moneybookers Account, the user’s email  address will no longer be used by Moneybookers, however it will remain  to be stored as part of your transaction history. You must ensure that  you have obtained all necessary consents for the use of the recipient’s  email address. Depending on the information you have provided us, your current  verification status and the type of transaction you wish to undertake,  we may collect further information from banks, credit/debit card  processing services, identity verification services and credit reference  agencies. See the section on “Use of Personal Information” for further  details.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Personal Information</strong><br> We use  your personal information to operate your Moneybookers Account and to  provide our services. We also share certain information as with banks or  credit/debit card processing services, identity verification services  and credit reference agencies as part of our normal business operations.  The purpose for sharing this data is to identify and verify users and  to limit our exposure fraud and other criminal activities and to manage  our financial risk. When conducting identification or fraud prevention  checks, the service provider may retain a record of our query along with  your information. By using our services you expressly agree to the  sharing of your personal date for these purposes. Furthermore, when  sending money to another Moneybookers Account holder we will, at a  minimum, pass on your email address to the recipient. We may also send  other personal details such as your name, address and country of  residence to recipients of any payments you make if such recipients  request this information from us in order to improve the payment  process, to reconcile payments with the commercial transaction or to  conduct their own anti-fraud and anti-money laundering checks.  We may also share your personal data with other companies within the  Moneybookers corporate group that are involved in providing services to  you or the recipient of a payment.  Your personal data may be shared with entities outside the European  Economic Area (“EEA”) if this is necessary for providing you with the  services requested by you, for example if you transfer funds to a  merchant that is not located in the EEA. You expressly consent to the  sharing of your data in this way. If you have been referred to us by a third party and that third party is  entitled to a commission payment based on transaction volumes, numbers  or types of transactions, we may share personal data, including  transactional information, with that third party in order to reconcile  commission payments.  Where personal data is collected by or through a third party such as a  merchant, promotion website or Moneybookers partner website, the  collection and use of your personal data may also be governed by the  privacy policy of the third party.</p>
<p><strong>Control of Personal Information</strong><br> If your personal details (such as your name, address, or telephone  number )  change you must immediately update your details in the  “Profile” section of your Moneybookers Account or by contacting Customer  Service. Moneybookers shall not be liable for any loss arising out of  your failure to keep your personal details up to date. Your address and  phone number can only be changed once in any 3 month period. In order to  deactivate your Account you will need to contact <a href="http://www.moneybookers.com/app/faqmessaging.pl">Customer Service</a>. We are by law required to retain certain records for a period of at least five years after closure of your Account.</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong><br> Upon successful registration, you will receive a confirmation email to  your registered primary email address. All further communication via  email will be sent to this primary email address which you can change at  any time. You may also receive system-generated transactional emails  such as confirmation of uploads, notification of receipt of payments,  notification of password changes etc. Registered users will occasionally  receive information on products, services and special deals via  newsletter, unless a user has chosen not to receive such communication.  You can change your choice whether or not to receive our newsletters in  the “Profile” section of your Moneybookers Account or in any newsletter  email by clicking on the appropriate link. Please note that you will  still receive communication regarding your Account such as transactional  emails or other notification affecting the operation of your Account or  our legal relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong><br> This website  contains links to third party websites. Please be aware that  Moneybookers is not responsible for the privacy practices of these third  party websites. We encourage users to read the privacy statements of  each website they visit by clicking a link on our website. This privacy  statement applies solely to the Moneybookers website and the  Moneybookers services.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br> Moneybookers protects your personal data against unauthorised access,  use or disclosure.  Once logged into your Account, all internet  communication is secured using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology with  high security 128bit encryption, certified by <em>Verisign Secured</em>.  However, this high level of protection can only be effective if you  follow certain security practices yourself.  You must never share your  Account or login details with anyone. If you are concerned that  any of  your login details have been compromised, you can change them any time  you like once you are logged on, however you should immediately contact  Customer Services and tell us why you think your login details have been  compromised. Please read our Account Terms of Use for further  information on how to keep your Moneybookers Account safe.     <br> <br> <strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br> Changes to this privacy statement are posted on our website. If we are  going to use your personal data in a manner different to the uses  stated at the time of collection we will also notify you via email. You  may object to any new use of your personal data by contacting Customer  Service, however, we will treat such an objection as a notice to  terminate your Moneybookers Account.</p></div>                </div>
