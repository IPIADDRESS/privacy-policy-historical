    <div class="ih-ac-content">
            <div class="ih-ac-inner-content">
      <p>This Part 2 sets out terms which apply to your purchase of Goods from us through the Website.</p>

      <h4>Part 2a - Purchase</h4>

      <p>You make an offer to purchase a Good from us (your "Order") by completing the staged process on the Website, as set out below:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Adding goods to your shopping basket</li>
        <li>Checkout step 1 – Login details</li>
        <li>Checkout step 2 – address details; and</li>
        <li>Checkout step 3 – payment details and Confirmation of Order</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Your Order only constitutes an offer to purchase Goods from us, and does not form a binding contract until it is accepted by us. When you order more than one (1) item, your Order contains a series of offers for each item individually.</p>

      <p>On receipt of your Order, we will send you an Order acknowledgement email to the email address which you provide in the Order process. This Order acknowledgement email will contain your Order number, details of the Goods ordered and a delivery estimate. Note that this email is only to acknowledge that your Order has been received, and is not acceptance by us of any offers to purchase Goods. You may withdraw your offer at any time before we accept your Order without any liability.</p>

      <p>We must receive full payment both of the price of the Goods and any applicable delivery charges before we can accept any offers. Where you select to pay by Mastercard, Visa, JCB, Delta, American Express we will process the payment at the time of preparing your Goods for dispatch. If paying via PayPal or Warehouse card we will process the payment at the point of order.</p>

      <p>An offer made by you to purchase Goods shall only be deemed to be accepted by us when we dispatch the Goods to you and send you an Order dispatch email which includes details of the Goods being dispatched. We reserve the right to refuse any offers in an Order prior to acceptance. If a particular item that you have ordered is not available, we will inform you of this in the Order dispatch email. Any Goods which are not available will be deleted from your Order and not form part of any contract between you and us.</p>

      <p>All prices and charges on the Website are in UK pounds sterling (although we may provide an indicative price in other currencies, this is not binding). Delivery charges may apply and these will be displayed in the order process.</p>

      <p>All prices are, unless otherwise stated, inclusive of UK VAT and other applicable UK taxes. Our VAT number is: 927570405. The actual price charged if you reside overseas will be subject to the exchange rate applied by your credit or debit card company.</p>

      <p>If you order Goods from our Website for delivery outside the UK, they may be subject to import duties and taxes which could be levied when the delivery reaches the specified destination. You will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes. Please note that we have no control over these charges and cannot predict their amount. Please contact your local customs office for further information before placing your order.</p>

      <p>Please note that you must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for which the Goods are destined. We will not be liable for any breach of any such laws by you.</p>

      <p>If you are using a Warehouse Card promotional discount code, please note this discount is only applicable when purchasing Goods with your Warehouse Card.</p>

      <p>The personalised and/or monogrammed services offered by us are only available to you if you reside in England, Wales or Scotland. We reserve the right to reject personalised and/or monogrammed Orders, at our sole discretion, where they breach our terms and conditions, any applicable laws, decency or we suspect that they may infringe any rights of third parties. On receipt of your Order, we will send you an Order acknowledgement email to the email address which you provide in the Order process. This Order acknowledgement email will contain your Order number, details of the Goods ordered and a delivery method. Note that this email is only to acknowledge that your Order has been received, and is not acceptance by us of any offers to purchase Goods. You may withdraw your offer at any time before we accept your Order without any liability.</p>

      <h4>Part 2b - Delivery</h4>

      <p>We currently offer the delivery options detailed on our <a href="https://www.warehouse.co.uk/gb/delivery-and-returns.html" target="_blank">delivery page</a>.</p>
      
      <p>We endeavour to ensure that the Goods that you order are provided by the agreed delivery date and, where applicable, time. However, delays could occur due to unforeseen circumstances. Neither Warehouse nor our nominated carrier shall be under any liability for any delay or failure to deliver the Goods within the estimated time frame for reasons outside of our or their control.</p>

      <p>The risk of loss and damage of the Goods passes to you on the date and time of delivery of the Goods.</p>

      <p>Delivery of all Goods outside of the EU will take (roughly) seven (7) - ten (10) days, except where this is not possible due to factors beyond our control.</p>

      <p>Delivery costs in the UK and Ireland are set out on our <a href="https://www.warehouse.co.uk/gb/delivery-and-returns.html" target="_blank">delivery page</a>.</p>

      <p>Delivery costs are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Europe: From €5.95 to €9.99</li>
        <li>USA: $15</li>
        <li>Australia: $20</li>
        <li>Rest of World: $25</li>
      </ul>

      <p>No changes can be made to the delivery address after the order has been made</p>

      <p>We ship to any British Force Post Office address ("BFPO"). The procedure is no different from mainland England shipping - simply enter your full BFPO address in the checkout including the BFPO postcode.</p>

      <h4>Part 2c - Buying Add-on Items(THE LITTLE THINGS)</h4>
   
      <p>Look for the Add-on Item messaging on our product pages:</p>

      <p>ADD-ON ITEM.(THE LITTLE THINGS)</p>
      <p>Add-on items are products that can be purchased only with orders of a total of £25 or more.($45 for Canada and Australia, $50 for New Zealand, 30€ for Europe, $30 for United States and 300kr for Sweden)</p>

      <p>Add-on items must be part of an order containing at least £25 of non-add on items within the same order.</p>

      <p>If your shopping bag contains a mix of Add-on items and other items but the other items do not reach the minimum £25 value, you will not be able to purchase your Add-on items. You can either remove the Add-on items from your bag and continue to checkout or add additional items to reach the £25 threshold.</p>

      <p>If your basket consists entirely of Add-on items you will not be able to proceed to checkout, you’ll need to purchase additional products which are not Add-On items in order to checkout.</p>

    </div></div>

    <h3 class="returning-goods">Part 3 - Returning Goods</h3>
    <div class="ih-ac-content">
            <div class="ih-ac-inner-content">
      <p>This Part 3 sets out the terms which govern your right to return any Goods that you do not want to keep.</p>

      <p>When we deliver your Goods to you we will include a dispatch note with information on how to return Goods to us. Returns details are set out <a href="https://www.warehouse.co.uk/gb/delivery-and-returns.html" target="_blank">here</a> (if you don't have your dispatch note to hand). If you want to return any Goods, you must complete the returns section on the dispatch note and enclose this with the Goods you are returning.</p>

      <p>You can, at any time within thirty (30) days of receiving Goods from us return any Goods to us as long as the original labels are still on the garments.</p>

      <p>The terms of this Part 3 do not affect your legal rights in respect of faulty, incorrect or damaged Goods, which you will be entitled to return in accordance with your rights set out under the heading "Your legal rights to cancel the contract (faulty Goods)" below. When returning any Goods to us, please follow one (1) of the options and instructions on our <a href="https://www.warehouse.co.uk/gb/delivery-and-returns.html" target="_blank">returns page</a>.</p>

      <p>Once you decide to return the Goods, you must not use them and you must take reasonable care of them while they remain in your possession. All labels must remain intact. The Goods must be returned to us intact, unused and undamaged as soon as reasonably possible. We will refund you the price paid for the Goods returned using the payment method you used when purchasing the Goods within fourteen (14) days' of receiving your return.</p>

      <h4>Your legal rights to cancel the contract (non-faulty Goods)</h4>

      <p>Separately to your contractual rights to return Goods within thirty (30) days, UK, ROI and EU customers enjoy cancellation rights under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 ("Consumer Contract Regulations"). If you wish, you may notify us via <a href="https://help.warehouse.co.uk/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000124412">customer service</a> informing us that you have changed your mind in respect of the Order, and that you wish to cancel your contract before the end of the statutory cancellation period (fourteen (14) days from the next working day after you receive the Goods). If you do change your mind, and want to cancel the contract before the end of the statutory cancellation period, you may complete the Withdrawal Form here and return it back to us. You will find details on how to send this back to us on the Withdrawal Form itself, or you can cancel your order by forwarding the Withdrawal Form by email to <a href="https://help.warehouse.co.uk/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000124412">customer service</a>. You must then return the Goods to us within fourteen (14) days of giving us notice of your cancellation/withdrawal in the manner specified on the Returns page to receive your refund.</p>

      <h4>Your legal rights to cancel the contract (non-faulty Goods)</h4>

      <p>We are under a legal duty to supply goods that are in conformity with this contract. See the summary below of your key legal rights in relation to the Goods. Nothing in these terms will affect your legal rights.</p>

      <h4>Summary of your key legal rights</h4>

            <div class="ih-ac-inner-content">
      <p>This Part 4 sets out some general terms that govern our relationship with you and purchases by you.</p>

      <p>We will not be held responsible for any delay or failure to comply with our obligations under these terms and conditions if the delay or failure arises from any cause that is beyond our reasonable control. </p>

      <p>We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us. If we fail to comply with these terms and conditions, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it with us during the sale process.</p>

      <p>We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; for breach of your legal rights in relation to the Goods as set out under the heading"Your legal rights to cancel the contract (non-faulty Goods)" above.</p>

      <p>We are not liable for business losses. We only supply the Goods for domestic and private use. If you use the Goods for any commercial, business or re-sale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.</p>

      <p>All notices which we need to give to you under these terms and conditions will be sent by us to the email address you provide at check-out.</p>

      <p>All communications from you to us must be made in English.</p>

      <p>These terms and conditions set out the entire agreement between you and us in respect of the sale, purchase and use of the Goods. They replace any and all previous agreements or understandings between us. </p>

      <p>If any provision of these terms and conditions is held by any competent authority to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, the validity of the other provisions (and the remainder of the provision in question) shall be unaffected.</p>

      <p>The intellectual property rights in all software and content made available to you on or through the Website is our property or the property of our licensors and all such rights are reserved by us and our licensors. You are not permitted to publish, manipulate, distribute or otherwise reproduce, in any format, any of the content or copies of the content supplied to you or which appears on the Website nor may you use any such content in connection with any business or commercial enterprise.</p>

      <p>'WAREHOUSE' and 'WAREHOUSE LONDON'  are trade marks belonging to us and no license or consent is granted to you to use these marks in any way, and you agree not to use these marks or any marks which are colourable similar without our written permission.</p>

      <p>We may transfer this contract to someone else. We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms and conditions to another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under this contract.</p>

      <p>You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else. You may only transfer your rights or you obligations under these terms to another person if we agree to this in writing.</p>

      <p>Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms and conditions, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the Goods, we can still require you to make the payment at a later date. </p>

      <p>We operate a complaints handling procedure which we will use to try to resolve disputes when they first arise: please contact us <a href="https://help.warehouse.co.uk/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000124412">here</a> if you have any complaints or comments.</p>

      <p>If your dispute remains unresolved, the EU Commission provides an online dispute resolution platform ("ODR Platform") for disputes regarding Goods bought online. You can find the ODR Platform on <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/?event=main.home.show.">here</a>.</p>

      <p>The interpretation, construction, effect and enforceability of these terms and conditions shall be governed by English Law unless you are entitled to rely on the laws of the country that you reside in.</p>

      <p>These terms and conditions are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the Goods in the English and Welsh courts. If you live in Scotland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the Goods in either the Scottish or the English and Welsh courts. If you live in Northern Ireland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the Goods in either the Northern Irish or the English and Welsh courts.</p>

<p>We take every reasonable step to ensure that your Personal Data are only Processed for the minimum period necessary for the purposes set out in this Notice. The criteria for determining the duration for which we will retain your Personal Data are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>(1) we will retain Personal Data in a form that permits identification only for as long as:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>(a) we maintain an ongoing relationship with you (e.g., where you have an account with us, or you are lawfully included in our mailing list and have not unsubscribed); or</li>
        <li>(b) your Personal Data are necessary in connection with the lawful purposes set out in this Notice, for which we have a valid legal basis (e.g., where your personal data are included in a contract between us and your employer, and we have a legitimate interest in processing those data for the purposes of operating our business and fulfilling our obligations under that contract; or where we have a legal obligation to retain your Personal Data),</li></ul>
</ul>
<strong>plus</strong>
<ul>
    <li>(2) the duration of:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>(a) any applicable limitation period under applicable law (i.e., any period during which any person could bring a legal claim against us in connection with your Personal Data, or to which your Personal Data are relevant); and</li>
        <li>(b) an additional two (2) month period following the end of such applicable limitation period (so that, if a person brings a claim at the end of the limitation period, we are still afforded a reasonable amount of time in which to identify any Personal Data that are relevant to that claim),</li></ul>
</ul>
<strong>and:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>(3) in addition, if any relevant legal claims are brought, we continue to Process Personal Data for such additional periods as are necessary in connection with that claim.</li></ul>

<p>During the periods noted in paragraphs (2)(a) and (2)(b) above, we will restrict our Processing of your Personal Data to storage of, and maintaining the security of, those data, except to the extent that those data need to be reviewed in connection with any legal claim, or any obligation under applicable law.</p>

<p>Once the periods in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) above, each to the extent applicable, have concluded, we will either:</p>
<ul>
    <li>permanently delete or destroy the relevant Personal Data; or</li>
    <li>anonymize the relevant Personal Data</li>

ISIS-accredited merchants now account for approximately two thirds of all UK online shopping.
