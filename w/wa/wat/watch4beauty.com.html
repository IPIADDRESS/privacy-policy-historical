                <p class="small">Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using the Service.</p>
                <p class="small">Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>
                <p class="small padding-bottom-32">By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>

                <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
                <p class="small">Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
                <p class="small">Subscriptions are operated by our authorized sales agents CCBill and Epoch. Please visit ccbill.com and epoch.com.</p>
                <p class="small">At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or K&nbsp;Production s.r.o. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through CCBill or Epoch account management page or by contacting K&nbsp;Production s.r.o. customer support team.</p>
                <p class="small padding-bottom-32">A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide our authorized sales agents with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize our sales agents to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments. K&nbsp;Production s.r.o. have no access to your payment details.</p>

                <h3>Free Trial</h3>

                <p class="small">You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
                <p class="small">If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by our authorized sales agents until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
                <p class="small padding-bottom-32">At any time and without notice, K&nbsp;Production s.r.o. reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>

                <h3>Fee Changes</h3>
                <p class="small">K&nbsp;Production s.r.o., in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
                <p class="small">K&nbsp;Production s.r.o. will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
                <p class="small padding-bottom-32">Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>

                <p class="small padding-bottom-32">Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by K&nbsp;Production s.r.o. on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of K&nbsp;Production s.r.o..</p>
