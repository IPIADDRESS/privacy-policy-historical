We are also committed to employing reasonable technology in order to protect the security of our Digital Media. However, even with the best technology, no website is 100% secure. Waterford’s security measures include</p><ul><li>Using industry-standard encryption to protect sensitive personal information,</li><li>Storing Personal Information in secure operating environments that have limited authorized access,</li><li>Requiring our website users to verify their identities with unique login information, and</li><li>Using industry-standard SSL protocols for communication when Digital Media information is in transit.</li></ul><p>For the safety of your Personal Information, we periodically review our security procedures in order to implement new and appropriate technology and methods.</p><p><strong id="use-of-the-cloud">Use of the Cloud. </strong>Our software and mobile apps are cloud based. This means they are stored in and run from the cloud, specifically an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (“VPC”). Amazon VPC guarantees the security and privacy of its VPC. The Amazon servers we utilize are hosted in the USA and in Asia. For more details, visit https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/. In addition to secure cloud storage, internal access to your Personal Information is restricted to authorized users (for example, the premium support team) and is only available through a secure tunnel between Waterford’s networks and Amazon’s VPC network. While in our database, select Personal Information is encrypted (such as student names and birthdays) and usage data is linked to students using internal identifiers. All database access requires authentication, and the back-end services restrict database access at the profile level. Also, our database is set up using Amazon Relational Database Service, which provides security and daily back-up snapshots to aid in case of disaster recovery.</p><p><strong id="outside-links">Outside Links. </strong>This Privacy Statement only applies to the Digital Media.
