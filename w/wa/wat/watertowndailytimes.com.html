                    <p>This Website may contain links to Web sites that are owned and operated by unrelated third parties in the United States or elsewhere. This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information collected on any third-party Website.  In most cases, third-party Websites have their own policies regarding privacy.  We recommend you review the privacy policy posted on any site you visit before using the site or providing any personal information about yourself.
                    
                    </p><p>If you do not consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy, you should not access or use this Website.</p>
                    
                    <h3>III. The Type Of Information That The Website Collects </h3>
                    
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">General Description</p>

                    <p>"Personal Information" is information that can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, postal address, email address, credit card number, telephone number and similar information.  Such information identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information.  We collect only Personal Information that you provide to us by using our Website.  Such information includes information automatically transferred by your computer and information that you knowingly enter in registration forms, applications, and other documents such as when you register for access to a restricted area of the Website intended only for registered users who pay a fee for access.</p>

                    <p>If you wish to access a restricted area of the Website, to register, you must provide us with certain Personal Information, including your name, e-mail address and postal mail address.  We will use this Personal Information to review and verify your registration information.  We may also use your Personal Information to notify you of any changes to this Policy.  You can always opt-out of receiving communications from us by following the "opt-out" procedures set forth on our Website.</p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Information You Provide to Us</p>

                    <p>We collect the Personal Information you voluntarily provide when you use a limited access portion of this Website.  For example, the information that you provide when you become a registered member and create an account, purchase products, subscribe to e-newsletters, or send us questions and comments is information that we may collect.  This information may include, for example, your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, information about your organization, credit card information, and information about your purchases.</p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser-Usage Data</p>

                    <p>We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your Web browser.  This information typically includes your IP address, the address of the Web page you were visiting when you accessed this Website, the name and version of your operating system and browser, and the date and time of your visit.  We collect and store this information to measure the Website's performance and improve the Website's design and functionality.  We may share this information with third parties to illustrate how the Website is used and for other marketing purposes, to improve the Website's design and functionality, statistically evaluate Website usage, or customize our Website's content, layout and services.</p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Cookies and Clear Gifs</p>

                    <p>We use "cookies" to collect information and support certain features and functionality of this Website.  A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server or that is stored in your computer's memory for the duration of your visit.  For example, we use cookies to collect statistical information about the ways visitors use this Website — which pages they visit, which links they use, how long they stay on each page and how often they return.  This information is known as "click-stream information" and does not include your Personal Information.

                    </p><p>If, however, you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this Website (for example, by creating an account), we may link the information collected by cookies to information that identifies you personally.  When you log into our Website, your registration ID number, e-mail address, name and other information may be stored in a cookie and used to customize your experience on the Website.

                    </p><p>If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer.  You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave this Website.  Although you are not required to accept our cookies when you visit this Website, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of this Website.

                    </p><p>The Website may also use clear gifs (also known as "web beacons") in combination with cookies, to help Website operators understand how visitors interact with the Website.  A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel by 1 pixel in size) that is placed on the Website, which allows the Website to measure the actions of a visitor who opens the page that contains the clear gif.  We use clear gifs to measure traffic and related behavior, and to improve your experience when visiting the Website.  We also use clear gifs to manage the content available on the Website. 

                    </p><p>The information provided by your browser and stored in our web server logs does not identify you personally.  We use this non-personal information primarily to create statistics that help us improve this Website and make it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors.  In addition, under appropriate circumstances, for example, if we receive a subpoena or suspect fraud, we may share our  server logs — which contain visitors' IP addresses — with law enforcement authorities or others who may use that information to trace and identify individuals. 

                    </p><p>To "opt-out" of (a) receiving communications from the Times (except for communications necessary for your use of the Website), (b) having your personally identifiable information disclosed to third parties for marketing purposes, or (c) any other consent previously granted for a specific purpose concerning your personally identifiable information, send an e-mail to the Times at online@wdt.net. </p>
                    
                    <h3>IV. Our Use and Disclosure Of Information</h3>
                    
                    <p>In addition to the uses described throughout this Privacy Policy, and subject to applicable law, we and our Service Providers (as described below) may disclose your Personal Information to:</p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Our Service Providers</p>

                    <p>The Times contracts with service providers who use cookies to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information, and monitor responses to e-mail and advertising campaigns.  The information obtained from cookies is used to administer the Website, improve the quality of your experience when visiting, and monitor the effectiveness of our marketing activities.  Data collected by third parties from this Website is owned and used by the Times, but is accessible by such third parties.  The Times may share your personal information with, for example, companies that help process credit card payments.  Our service providers are required by contract to protect the confidentiality of the personal information we share with them and to use it only to provide specific services on our behalf.</p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Third Parties</p>

                    <p>The Times does not share e-mail and postal mailing lists with any other organizations in addition to those expressly stated herein.  The Times does not sell or rent telephone numbers, e-mail addresses or fax numbers of registered users or others who communicate contact information to it or whose contact information has been otherwise obtained by the Times.</p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Business Transfers</p>

                    <p>Information submitted through this Website is a business asset of the Times and will become part of its normal business records.  Your Personal Information may be transferred to another entity (either an affiliated entity or an unrelated third party) in connection with a merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar corporate event.  In the event of a merger, liquidation, dissolution, or sale or transfer of substantially all of the assets of the Times, Personal Information and/or Usage Data collected from you or about you may be sold, assigned, or transferred to the party acquiring all or substantially all of the equity and/or assets of the Times to permit the party to continue the operation of the Website, including the restricted areas.  Subject to your ability to opt-out, by using this Website and submitting your information to us, you consent to the sale and transfer of your Personal Information as described in this paragraph.</p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Government and Legal Disclosures</p>

                    <p>We may disclose the Personal Information we collect through this Website, when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law (or a court order or subpoena), to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft, to enforce our Terms and Conditions or other agreements that govern your use of this Website, or to protect the rights, property or safety of the Times, our members or others.</p>
                    
                    <h3>V. Click-Through Agreements</h3>
                    
                    <p>Before you may use certain areas of this Website, you may be asked to indicate your acceptance of certain special terms and conditions by clicking on a button marked "O.K." or "I agree."  Any special terms and conditions to which you agree will supplement and amend this Privacy Policy, but only with respect to your use of those areas of this Website.</p>
                    
                    <h3>VI. Privacy Notices</h3>
                    
                    <p>This Privacy Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by "privacy notices" posted on this Website.  For example, certain pages of this Website contain privacy notices providing details about the personal information we collect on those pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information.</p>
                    
                    <h3>VII. The Choices You Have</h3>
                    
                    <p>The Times respects your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use and disclose your Personal Information.  We generally ask you to indicate your choices at the time and on the page where you provide your Personal Information.</p>

<p>You may browse this Website without providing any information that identifies you personally and may choose not to provide the information we request, although this may mean that you can not make a purchase or take advantage of other features of this Website.</p>

<p>You may cancel your registration to any part of the Website at any time by following the appropriate instructions contained on the Website.</p>
                    
                    <h3>VIII. Unsolicited Comments and Feedback</h3>

                    <p>We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving payment data.  We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of personal information that we have collected from or about you.  We are in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act for any data that we may collect that is subject to this regulation.  It is important that you understand, however, that no Website or database is completely secure or "hacker proof."  You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized disclosure or misuse, for example, by protecting your passwords.</p>

                    <p>We take seriously the security of the information we collect.  The Times has therefore implemented technology and security policies and procedures intended to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorized disclosure or access to, such information, reasonably appropriate to the nature of the data concerned.  If we believe that the security of information that you have provided to us has been compromised, we may notify you by e-mail, if we have your email address.</p>
                    
                    <h3>X. Changes And Updates to This Privacy Policy</h3>
