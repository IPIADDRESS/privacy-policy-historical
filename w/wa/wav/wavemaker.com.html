            <ol class="mainLi">
                <p>Your privacy is important to WaveMaker, Inc. ("WaveMaker", "we", "us" or "our").
                This privacy policy provides details about how your personal information is collected and used by us.
                Personal information is any information that identifies you or would enable someone to contact you,
                such as your name, email address, phone number and other non-public information associated with your individual identity.
                This privacy policy explains our commitment to protecting the privacy of personal information about users of WaveMaker websites,
                software, products and services (collectively, the "Site").  </p><br>

                <li>
                    <h4>Information Collected</h4>

                    <p>We may collect personal information when you register to use the Site. Personal information may include your name,
                     username, your password (we only store an encrypted version of this; not the actual password),
                     one or more email addresses and other contact information.</p>

                     <p>If you use the Site from outside the United States, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to our systems in the United States
                       and wherever we, our affiliates and service providers operate.</p>

                     <p>Like most web-based services, we may automatically collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website.
                     This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type,
                     Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data ("Usage Data").
                     We may associate Usage Data to your account information. </p>

                     <p>Like many websites, we may also use "cookies" to collect information.
                     A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.
                     We may use "persistent cookies" to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site;
                     and we may use "session ID cookies" to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with
                     the Site and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Site. You can instruct your browser,
                     by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
                     If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of our services.
                     Your use of a "Do Not Track" option in your browser will not affect our data collection practices.</p>

                        We may use Usage Data that does not identify individual users to analyze trends and Site traffic,
                        to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, or to administer, improve or promote the Site.

                   You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information,

                    <h4>Required Disclosures</h4>

                    <p>Except as stated in this privacy policy, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties except
                    when we must comply with laws that require such disclosure to law enforcement authorities or other government third party officials
