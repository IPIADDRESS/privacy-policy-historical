<p>At Wave Broadband we take your privacy seriously and we want you to know our 
  policies. This Notice will give you an overview of those policies and how we 
  will apply them in specific situations.</p>
<p>The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (the “Cable Act”) contains 
  restrictions on the collection, disclosure and retention by cable operators 
  of personally identifiable information about subscribers to cable television 
  or certain other services. Other federal law also may apply to some services, 
  including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (the “ECPA”). 
  This Notice informs subscribers of our policies regarding personally identifiable 
  information we obtain in the course of providing our services that are subject 
  to the privacy provisions of the Cable Act. Those services currently consist 
  of our video programming service and our Internet access service. Not all of 
  these services may be available in your local cable system. Our policies are 
  intended to conform to the requirements of the Cable Act, the ECPA and other 
  applicable law. The term “Wave Broadband,” “we,” “our” 
  or “us” refers to any company that is controlled by WaveDivision 
  Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and through which you subscribe 
  to any cable or other service covered by the privacy provisions of the Cable 
  Act or other laws mentioned in this Notice.</p>
<p>Policy Overview. This Notice tells you our policies regarding:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The kinds of personally identifiable information we collect;</li>
  <li> How we use that information;</li>
  <li> The nature, frequency and purpose of any disclosure we may make of that 
    information and the types of persons and entities to which the disclosure 
    may be made;</li>
  <li> The period during which we will keep that information;</li>
  <li> The choices available to you regarding collection, use and disclosure of 
    that information, including the times and place at which you may have access 
    to that information; and</li>
  <li> Certain rights you may have regarding that information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Information is “personally identifiable” if it can be used to identify 
  or contact an individual, such as his or her name and address or telephone number. 
  It also includes information that links data about an individual’s activities 
  or history to that individual, such as the combination of the individual’s 
  name with the fact that he or she purchased a specific product online, so that 
  someone else with access to the combined information could learn that the named 
  person bought the particular item. Information that does not permit an individual 
  to be identified or contacted and that does not permit information about his 
  or her activities or history to be linked to him or her is not “personally 
  identifiable information.” Among other things, this means that if we separate 
  data about your activities from your name or other data that identifies you, 
  then that data is no longer “personally identifiable information.” 
  For example, we might compile data we have about our Wave Broadband Internet 
  access customers into aggregate or other anonymous forms, such as the monthly 
  average number of customers who use the service to visit travel-related Websites.</p>
<p>Our policies described in this Notice apply to personally identifiable information 
  about you that you furnish to us or that we otherwise collect in the course 
  of providing you with one of our services. Those policies apply to such information 
  whether we obtain it “online” (such as when you subscribe for our 
  cable service on a Website we operate) or “offline” (such as when 
  you subscribe for our cable service using the telephone or a paper order form). 
  Please note, however, that if you use a Website we operate for purposes of our 
  cable or other services, then additional online privacy policies may apply that 
  cover topics unique to Internet usage, such as use of “cookies.” 
</p>
<p>Some of our services, including our Internet access service and interactive 
  cable television programming allow you to interact with companies and individuals 
  that are independent of Wave Broadband. By using those services, you may enable 
  these companies or individuals to independently learn personally identifiable 
  information about you. The policies in this Notice do not apply to personally 
  identifiable information or other information that you provide to any of these 
  third parties or that they collect independently of us. These third parties 
  may not be obligated to comply with Wave Broadband’s privacy policies 
  or the privacy provisions of the Cable Act. They may have their own privacy 
  policies, but Wave Broadband is not responsible or liable to you if such third 
  parties do not have appropriate policies or if they fail to follow those policies.</p>
<p>The Kinds of Personally Identifiable Information We Collect and How We Use 
  It. In order to provide our services to you, we keep business records that contain 
  personally identifiable information about you, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your name, home and work e-mail and postal addresses, telephone numbers, 
    social security number, driver's license number, credit or debit card numbers 
    and expiration dates and bank account information for billing purposes, payment 
    history and credit reports;</li>
  <li>Depending on the services we provide to you, information on the number, 
    location within your home and configuration of television sets, converters, 
    cable modems, personal computers, telephones or other service-related equipment 
    or devices in your home;</li>
  <li>Maintenance and repair records for the equipment in your home used for the 
    services;</li>
  <li> The services and service options you select and, in the case of any service 
    where you have a choice of whether or not to use a particular feature, program 
    or offering, the information transmitted through our cable facilities or that 
    you otherwise communicate to us in order to make a choice;</li>
  <li>Information about your satisfaction or usage of a service that we obtain 
    from subscriber interviews or questionnaires or other feedback from you;</li>
  <li>A record of whether you rent or own your home so that we can obtain any 
    permission required prior to installing our cable or equipment;</li>
  <li> Subscriber correspondence (via e-mail or otherwise);</li>
  <li>A record of any violations and alleged violations of the agreements, terms, 
    conditions or policies that govern your use of our services; and</li>
  <li>Other information that we need to render a service to you or conducting 
    our business of providing that service.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, we use this personally identifiable information as necessary to 
  render our services to you, to detect unauthorized reception of cable communications 
  and for tax, legal, accounting and other purposes related to our business of 
  providing our services to subscribers, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To make sure you are being billed properly and pay for the services you 
    receive;</li>
  <li>To send you pertinent announcements about the Wave Broadband services you 
    receive;</li>
  <li> To improve the quality of Wave Broadband’s services;</li>
  <li> To answer questions from subscribers such as troubleshooting; and</li>
  <li> To send promotional material or information to you about other products 
    and services available from Wave Broadband or others, subject to applicable 
    law and any “opt-out” choice you make as described in this Notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without your written or electronic consent, we may not collect this personally 
  identifiable information about you over our cable system unless it is necessary 
  to render a service you receive or detect unauthorized reception of cable communications. 
  If you use the Wave Broadband Internet access service or an interactive television 
  service we provide, then as a necessary incident of providing that service, 
  our computer systems automatically capture and store information that may include, 
  but is not limited to, the interactive television service offerings you order 
  using such interactive television service and the Websites you visit using such 
  Internet access service; the dates, times and length of your Internet visits 
  or telephone calls; the IP (Internet Protocol) of the computer you use or e-mail 
  addresses or telephone numbers that you communicate with; and the text of e-mail 
  or other electronic communications you send or receive using any of these services. 
  We use that information to provide the service, bill and collect service-related 
  charges, ensure compliance with applicable law and contractual provisions and 
  customize our services based on the interests of subscribers and for tax, legal, 
  accounting and other purposes related to our business of providing such services. 
  Any personally identifiable information that may be derived from these logs 
  is subject to the policies described in this Notice and to our obligations under 
  the ECPA and other applicable law.</p>
<p>We may also combine personally identifiable information that we obtain from 
  you in the course of our business of providing a service to you with personally 
  identifiable information that we obtain from third parties for the purpose of 
  creating an enhanced personal database to use in marketing and other activities.</p>
<p>Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information by Us. Under the Cable Act, 
  Wave Broadband may not disclose personally identifiable information about you 
  except in certain limited circumstances.</p>
<p>We may disclose personally identifiable information about you with your prior 
  written or electronic consent. As permitted by the Cable Act, Wave Broadband 
  also may disclose from time to time, without such consent, personally identifiable 
  information about you if necessary to render, or conduct a legitimate business 
  activity related to, a cable service or other service provided to you. The kinds 
  of persons or entities to which we may make such disclosures (to the extent 
  permitted by the Cable Act) include, but are not necessarily limited to, the 
  following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Persons or entities that control, are controlled by, or under common control 
    with Wave Broadband;</li>
  <li>Billing services, collection agencies and credit agencies;</li>
  <li> Installation, repair and other contractors and subcontractors or suppliers 
    of goods or services we use in providing a service to you;</li>
  <li> Sales representatives used to market our services;</li>
  <li> Accountants, lawyers, consultants and other professionals we or our affiliated 
    companies use in our businesses; and</li>
  <li> Cable programming or content suppliers and program guide distributors.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if Wave Broadband or its affiliates directly or indirectly transfer 
  ownership of or an interest in all or part of the business of providing a service 
  you subscribe for, we may disclose or transfer your subscriber records to the 
  purchaser or other party to the extent necessary to complete the transaction 
  or permit the purchaser or other party to continue to provide you with service 
  after the transaction is completed. This kind of transaction could take the 
  form of a merger, sale of stock or assets, formation of a joint venture, investment 
  or some other structure.</p>
<p>Information we disclose for purposes relating to billing and levels of service 
  usage is generally provided on a monthly basis. Information for other purposes 
  is provided as it is needed.</p>
<p>As permitted by the Cable Act, we may also from time to time disclose lists 
  of our subscribers to third parties for purposes other than those referred to 
  above. Those lists may contain your name and address, so long as we have given 
  you the opportunity to prohibit or limit such disclosure and we do not also 
  reveal, directly or indirectly, the extent of any viewing or other use of the 
  services we provide to you or the nature of any transaction you make using those 
  services. This permits us, among other things, to disclose your name and address 
  to charities, advertisers, direct mail marketers and telemarketers for use in 
  telephone or mail solicitations, market research or other purposes. You have 
  the right to elect not to be included on such a list. It you do not desire to 
  be included on any such list, you may "opt out" by contacting your 
  local Wave Broadband cable office, which is identified on each monthly bill 
  you receive. If you use the Wave Broadband Internet access service to send or 
  receive an email message or other electronic communication, the ECPA permits 
  us to access the content of those communications. It also permits us to disclose 
  such information to an addressee or intended recipient (or his or her agent); 
  to a person involved in forwarding such information to its destination or when 
  it is necessarily incident to providing service or to protect our rights or 
  property; or to any one with the consent of the subscriber or an addressee or 
  intended recipient (or his or her agent). The Cable Act also permits us to disclose 
  personally identifiable information about you if authorized by a court order 
  and if you have been notified of such order. If a governmental authority seeks 
  the disclosure of personally identifiable information under any law except (i) 
  the ECPA or (ii) the federal “pen register/trap and trace” statute 
  (which we refer to as “the Register/Trace Statute”), then the Cable 
  Act may prohibit such disclosure unless the disclosure is required by a court 
  order and the following two special requirements are met:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you have been given the opportunity to appear and contest in court any claims 
    made in support of the court order sought by the governmental authority; and</li>
  <li>in the court proceeding, the governmental authority has offered clear and 
    convincing evidence that you are reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal 
    activity and that the information sought would be material evidence in a case 
    against you.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a governmental authority seeks personally identifiable information about 
  you under the ECPA or the Register/Trace Statute, the Cable Act’s requirements 
  are different depending on the nature of the information sought. If the governmental 
  authority wants disclosure of records revealing cable subscriber selection of 
  video programming, then we may disclose it only if authorized or required by 
  a court order and only if the two special requirements of the Cable Act stated 
  above are met. If, however, the government seeks any other kind of personally 
  identifiable information, then those two special requirements do not have to 
  be met and the government may require us to make the disclosure if authorized 
  by the ECPA or the Register/Trace Statute. In some cases, this will mean that 
  the disclosure may be required without a court order, without any prior notice 
  to you that the government seeks the disclosure, without any prior opportunity 
  for you to oppose the disclosure and without any notice that the disclosure 
  has been made as required.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, if you subscribe to any of our Internet or telephony 
  services, the ECPA permits us to disclose the contents of your e-mail or other 
  communications to a law enforcement agency if we reasonably believe that an 
  emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to 
  any person requires disclosure of the information without delay. We may do so 
  without prior notice to you, without your consent and without being required 
  to do so by a warrant, subpoena, court order or law. Examples of situations 
  in which we might make such disclosures are where we reasonably believe that 
  there is an immediate risk of death, suicide or terrorist activity.</p>
<p>The ECPA provides for other exceptional circumstances under which we may be 
  compelled or permitted to disclose personally identifiable information about 
  you or the content of your communications. For example, the content of your 
  e-mail or other communications may be disclosed to law enforcement agencies 
  if it appears to be evidence of child pornography, or was inadvertently obtained 
  by us and appears to pertain to the commission of a crime.</p>
<p>The Social Security Act provides that state welfare agencies may obtain from 
  our subscriber lists the names and addresses of individuals who owe or are owed 
  child support and the names and addresses of their employers. The law says that 
  this information can be obtained through an administrative subpoena issued by 
  the state welfare agency, without a court order, and does not require that a 
  subscriber be given notice of and the opportunity to contest the disclosure.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a copyright owner believes that the copyright has been infringed 
  by an Internet user who uses an online service to post, download or otherwise 
  use the copyrighted work without permission. The owner may know some information, 
  such as the user’s e-mail or IP address, but may not know the user’s 
  true identity. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act provides for a copyright 
  owner to obtain a subpoena seeking disclosure from an online service provider 
  of the identity of a user who is believed to have infringed the copyright. Upon 
  receipt of a subpoena, the online service provider is required to expeditiously 
  identify the alleged infringer.</p>
<p>Wave Broadband will disclose personally identifiable information about you 
  when required by law or legal process, after giving effect to the Cable Act’s 
  requirements.</p>
<p>Time Period During Which We Retain Personally Identifiable Information. The 
  Cable Act requires us to destroy personally identifiable information if the 
  information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected 
  and there are no pending requests by you for access to it or pending court orders 
  or other legal process requiring that we disclose it to a third party. In most 
  cases, this means that we will have personally identifiable information about 
  you for so long as you are a subscriber and continue to retain it thereafter 
  for as long as it may reasonably be required to comply with tax, accounting 
  and any applicable contractual or legal requirements, which could be seven years 
  or more after you stop being a subscriber.</p>
<p>Access to Our Records About You. Under the Cable Act, cable subscribers have 
  the right to inspect our records that contain personally identifiable information 
  about them and to have a reasonable opportunity to correct any errors in such 
  information. If you wish to exercise this right, please notify us at the local 
  Wave Broadband office specified on your bill, and we will contact you to arrange 
  a mutually convenient time during our regular business hours.</p>
<p>Your Rights Under the Cable Act. The Cable Act provides you with a cause of 
  action for damages, attorneys' fees and costs in Federal District Court if we 
  violate the Cable Act’s limitations on the collection, disclosure, and 
  retention of personally identifiable information about you.</p>
