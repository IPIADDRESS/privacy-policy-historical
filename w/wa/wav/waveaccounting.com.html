      Hi! Great to see that you care about your privacy! We do, too.
    </p>

    <p class="wv-text">
      That's why we worked with privacy consultants and international experts to make sure we've thought through how to best protect you. In an attempt to make this sort of document less painful, we’ve provided a simplified version, just like we did for our <a class="wv-text--link" href="/terms/" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>.

      Below, on the left: That's the official stuff that you're agreeing to. On the right, you'll see how I'd explain it to my father (hey dad!) if he asked. You can use that as a guide to find and understand the info you want to know about.
    </p>

    <p class="wv-text">
      I sincerely hope it helps you better understand this document, what you’re consenting to, and how we operate. Thanks for joining the Wave community!
