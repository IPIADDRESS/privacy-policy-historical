      Hi! Great to see that you care about your privacy! We do, too.
    </p>
    <p class="wv-text">
      That's why we worked with privacy consultants and international experts to make sure we've thought through how to best protect you. In an attempt to make this sort of document less painful, we’ve provided a simplified version, just like we did for our <a class="wv-text--link" href="/terms/" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>.

    <p class="wv-text">
      Below, on the left: That's the official stuff that you're agreeing to. On the right, you'll see how I'd explain it to my father (hey dad!) if he asked. You can use that as a guide to find and understand the info you want to know about.
    </p>
    <p class="wv-text">
      I sincerely hope it helps you better understand this document, what you’re consenting to, and how we operate. Thanks for joining the Wave community!

If required, we will disclose your personal information to these service providers to the extent required by us to receive these services. For instance: (i) for occasional messages from Wave, we will share only your email address and name (where applicable) with a service provider; and (ii) for the weekly summary of your account information (the "Your week in numbers" email), we will share your email address and name (where applicable) and send via our providers news about your account balances, year-to-date financial overview, overdue invoices and expenses and other select account details. For other service providers, we will provide such additional information as may be required for us to receive the services; however, these companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
