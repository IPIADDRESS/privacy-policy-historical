<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>We Use Vendors and Service Providers</strong>. We employ service providers to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them so we can provide products or Services to you. The types of service providers (processors) to whom we entrust Personal Information include service providers for: (i) provision of IT and related services; (ii) provision of information and services you have requested; (iii) payment processing; (iv) customer service activities; and (v) in connection with the provision of the Site. Wanelo has executed appropriate contracts with the service providers that prohibit them from using or sharing Personal Information except as necessary to perform the contracted services on our behalf or to comply with applicable legal requirements.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Business Partners</strong>. Wanelo may share Personal Information with our business partners and affiliates for our and our affiliates’ internal business purposes or to provide you with a product or service that you have requested, such as to fulfill a transaction by an affiliate on Wanelo’s Services. You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with a Wanelo transaction or Service by the store’s information published on store pages, product pages and details on order confirmation materials. Wanelo may also provide Personal Information to business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. In such cases, our business partner’s name will appear, along with Wanelo. Wanelo requires our affiliates and business partners to agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality and security of Personal Information they maintain on our behalf and not to use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which Wanelo provided them.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Displaying to Other Users</strong>. The content you post to the Site, including reviews and your user profile information may be displayed on the Site. Other users of the Site may be able to see some information about you, such as your name if you submit a review. User profile information, including without limitation your name, email address, and other information may be displayed to other users if you chose to enter such information on your user profile. Your user profile is public on the Services. Any content (including without limitation images, captions, and comments) you post on the Services is not protected by Wanelo; it becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others and may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels. We are not responsible for other users who may view and use the posted information.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disclosures to Protect Us or Others (e.g., as Required by Law and Similar Disclosures)</strong>. We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, other account information, and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (i) comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (ii) respond to your requests; (iii) protect your, our or others’ rights, property, or safety; (iv) enforce Wanelo policies or contracts; (v) collect amounts owed to Wanelo; (vi) prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (vii) disclose information for necessary or advisable reasons.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, from time to time, server logs or other information may be reviewed for security purposes – e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Services. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers</strong>. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract. In such event, Wanelo will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such Personal Information was collected.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>5.2. INTERNATIONAL Data Transfers</h3>

<h2>6. Opt-Out (RIGHT TO OBJECT TO PROCESSING)</h2>
<h3>6.1. General</h3>

<h3>6.3. Mobile devices</h3>
<p>Wanelo may occasionally send you push notifications through our mobile applications with notices that may be of interest to you. You may at any time opt out from receiving these types of communications by changing the settings on your mobile device.

<h3>6.5. "Do Not Track"</h3>
<p>
Do Not Track ("<strong>DNT</strong>") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
</p>
<h3>6.5. Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising</h3>
<p>As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings. See http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice.</p>
<p>
The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>,

</p>
<p>To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes. Even if you opt out, we may still collect and use non-Personal Information regarding your activities on our Sites and/or information from the advertisements on Third-Party websites for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements. Note that if you opt out, the Services may not function properly, or some features may be unavailable.</p>
<h2>7. Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction</h2>

If Wanelo determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Wanelo will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.</p>
