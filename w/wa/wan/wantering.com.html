<h3 class="h3 content-h3" id="1">1.&nbsp;What Information Does the Site Collect?</h3>

<h4 class="h4 content-h4" id="1a">(a)&nbsp;Information You Provide to Us</h4>

<p class="content-p">
    <span class="h4 content-h4">Personal Information and Demographic Information</span> On the Site, we may ask you to provide certain categories of information such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as
    your first and last name, email address and phone number (“
    <strong>Personal Information</strong>”); and (2) demographic information, such as information about your gender (“
    <strong>Demographic Information</strong>”).&nbsp; We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Site, including if you register for a newsletter, through “contact us” forms, or when you otherwise interact
    with the Site.&nbsp; If we combine Demographic Information with the Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Site, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h4 class="h4 content-h4" id="1b">(b)&nbsp;Information We Collect and Store As You Access and Use the Site</h4>

<p class="content-p">In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Site, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect and store certain information
    whenever you visit or interact with the Site (“
    <strong>Usage Information</strong>”).&nbsp; This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, laptop, tablet or mobile phone (a “
    <strong>Device</strong>”) whenever you visit or interact with our Site.&nbsp; Usage Information may be non‑identifying or may be associated with you.&nbsp; Whenever we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal
    Information.&nbsp; This Usage Information may include:</p>

<ul class="content-list">
    <li class="content-li disc-content-li">your IP address or other unique identifier (“
        <strong>Device Identifier</strong>”).&nbsp; A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Site, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;</li>
    <li class="content-li disc-content-li">your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);</li>
    <li class="content-li disc-content-li">the URL that referred you to our Site;</li>

</ul>

<p class="content-p">We may use various developed methods and technologies to collect Usage Information</p>


<p class="content-p">
    <span class="h4 content-h4">Tracking Technologies</span> Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device.&nbsp; A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology
    and methods later developed):</p>

<p class="content-p">
    <span class="h4 content-h4">Cookies</span> A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site.&nbsp; A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your
    Device.&nbsp; HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage.&nbsp; Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in.&nbsp; Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial
    browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.&nbsp; Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard.&nbsp;
    Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies.&nbsp; For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe’s web site <a href="http://www.adobe.com/" class="blended">www.adobe.com</a>.&nbsp; Please be aware that if you

<p class="content-p">
    <span class="h4 content-h4">Web Beacons</span> Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our Site’s pages and messages.&nbsp; Web beacons may be invisible to you, but
    any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.&nbsp; Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Site,
    to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>

<p class="content-p">
    <span class="h4 content-h4">Embedded Scripts</span> An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on.&nbsp; The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third
    party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>

<p class="content-p">
    <span class="h4 content-h4">Browser Fingerprinting</span> Collection and analysis of information from your Device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.</p>

<p class="content-p">
    <span class="h4 content-h4">ETag, or entity tag</span> A feature of the cache in browsers.&nbsp; It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.&nbsp; If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned.&nbsp;
    Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier.&nbsp; ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash and/or HTML5 cookies.</p>

<p class="content-p">We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:</p>

<p class="content-p">
    <span class="h4 content-h4">Strictly Necessary</span> We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Site, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of Site
    functionality.</p>

<p class="content-p">
    <span class="h4 content-h4">Performance‑Related</span> We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Site, including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the Site.</p>

<p class="content-p">
    <span class="h4 content-h4">Functionality‑Related</span> We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing the Site, including identifying you when you visit our Site or keeping track of our specified preferences, including in
    terms of the presentation of content on our Site.</p>

<p class="content-p">
    <span class="h4 content-h4">Targeting‑Related</span> We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on our Site and third‑party sites based on how you interact with our content and ads.&nbsp; This includes using Tracking Technologies to understand
    the usefulness to you of the content and ads that have been delivered to you.&nbsp; Further information on this, and your opt-out choices, is found in Section 5 below.</p>

<p class="content-p">There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Site.&nbsp; Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Site, which may include the collection of information about your
    online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services.&nbsp; We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them.&nbsp; However, you consent to potentially encountering third-party Tracking
    Technologies in connection with use of our Site and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="content-p">We may receive information about you from our affiliates and others that use the Site, such as when they submit content to us or post on the Site.&nbsp; Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on
    our Site with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to determine your location, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you.&nbsp; To
    the extent we combine information we receive from those sources with Personal Information we collect on the Site, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed
    otherwise.&nbsp; In no other circumstances do our promises under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.</p>

<h4 class="h4 content-h4" id="1d">(d)&nbsp;Interactions with Third Party Sites</h4>

<p class="content-p">The Site may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Site and your account on a third-party web site or application.&nbsp; The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information,
    including Personal Information, to us.&nbsp; For example, when you wish to post a comment on one of our blogs, you may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third-party site or application to facilitate the registration
    process on the Site, or otherwise link accounts.&nbsp; If we offer and you choose to use this functionality to access or use our Site, the third-party site or application may send Personal Information about you to us.&nbsp; If so, we will then treat
    it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on our Site.&nbsp; In addition, we may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Site to facilitate
    your sending a communication from the Site.&nbsp; For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings.&nbsp; These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities
    and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Clique may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties.&nbsp; Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using
    their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices.&nbsp; You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Site.</p>

    any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.&nbsp; Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Site, your email address, mobile number, name or user name and
    message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s).</p>

<p class="content-p">Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party web
    sites or online services (
    <em>e.g.</em>, browser do not track signals).&nbsp; Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.</p>
