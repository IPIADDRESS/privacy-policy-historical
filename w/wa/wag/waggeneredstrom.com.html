<h3><u>Safe Harbor</u></h3>

<p>Waggener Edstrom recognizes that the European Union (“EU”) has an “omnibus” data protection regime established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) (“Directive”). Among other things, the Directive generally restricts the transfer of Personal Information about individuals in the European Union to the United States, unless there is “adequate protection” for such Personal Information when it is received in the United States. In order to address this restriction, Waggener Edstrom and its affiliates in the United States (“Waggener Edstrom US”) adhere to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce (“Safe Harbor”) with respect to Personal Information that Waggener Edstrom US obtains about (i) visitors to the Site who are located in the European Union, and (b) certain Influentials (defined below) who are located in the EU (“EU Personal Information”).
