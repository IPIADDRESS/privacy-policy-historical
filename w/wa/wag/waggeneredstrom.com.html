For those purposes, we may collect your IP address, information about your browser, including whether you are accessing the Site through a mobile device, and other usage information.<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We generally use session cookies instead of persistent cookies, but third parties also might use some persistent cookies, as discussed in more detail below under “Third Party Services.”</p>
<p>The Technologies that we may use may differ depending upon the device that you use to access the Site and may change as Technologies and access channels develop or change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The types of Personal Data that we and/or third parties may automatically collect through cookies or other Technologies may include, but are not limited to, your IP address and information about your browser, including whether you are accessing the site through a mobile device.&nbsp; We generally may use or otherwise Process this information in order to enable Third Party Services, to provide Services to you, and for purposes of Site functionality (<em>e.g</em>. to remember your login information), but we generally reserve the right to use and Process Personal Data obtained through Technologies for any lawful purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, we may collect certain kinds of information about your computer to facilitate, evaluate and verify your use of the Site or our Services, including the frequency with which you visit the Site, the times and dates of your visits, the pages you reviewed, types of Services used, and how many users we receive daily. This information is generally collected in aggregate form&nbsp; without identifying any user individually, although IP addresses and session IDs may be tracked in relation to your purchase activity as part of Waggener Edstrom’s customer order review and fraud prevention efforts.&nbsp; We also use the IP Address of your computer to identify server problems, administer the Site, and compile aggregated statistics for marketing and research purposes. We use navigational data, including log files and click-stream data, to identify information about your web browser and operating system, and the time period in which you visit the Site or a portion of the Site. This information is used to administer the Site, improve Site content, and compile aggregated statistics for research purposes.</p>
<p>You may be able to “opt-out”, disable or restrict some cookies or other Technologies, such as through your web or other browser settings or through third party mechanisms (<em>e.g</em>., some industry trade associations offer some opt-out mechanisms). However, not all cookies or other Technologies are so controlled, not all “opt-out” or similar mechanisms or Technologies work on all browsers or access devices, and even effective opt-out opportunities can become ineffective over time or as Technologies or browsers change.&nbsp; You can find more information about cookies and your ability to control their use at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ or by reviewing your browser or access device settings.&nbsp; Although such information should be helpful, we do not control or guarantee its accuracy or that it will be effective with respect to all Technologies or in all circumstances.&nbsp; If you choose to refuse cookies or other Technologies from our Site, some functionalities or features of the Site might not work properly, may be slower, or may be unavailable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>California Disclosure</em>.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>CA Bus. &amp; Prof. Code § 22575 requires us to disclose our how Site responds to Web browser “do not track” signals and/or other mechanisms that seek to provide consumers with the ability to control the collection of their Personal Data through online tracking Technologies for certain purposes, such as targeted or behavioral advertising.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that we do not knowingly use Personal Data collected on our Site through cookies or other Technologies for targeted or behavioral advertising, or knowingly allow third parties to use our Site do so.&nbsp; If your browser or similar mechanism gives our Site a “do not track” signal, the Site may not honor it to the extent that the Site may use cookies or other tracking Technologies for the purposes described in this section or under “Third Party Services” (“Approved Sharing”).&nbsp; If your settings and our Site are nuanced enough to allow such Approved Sharing but also readily preclude tracking for behavioral advertising by third parties, the Site will make commercially reasonable attempts to honor your settings.&nbsp; However, we do not make any promises or guarantees about the effects of any “Do Not Track” choice that you may make because: (a) such nuanced treatment isn’t necessarily available or effective for any or all browsers, mechanisms or Technologies, and our commercially reasonable attempts to honor your settings might or might not be effective to preclude tracking or behavioral advertising by third parties at all or over any particular period of time; (b) third parties may not honor your settings or our policies and/or may use cookies or other Technologies for behavioral advertising despite our commercially reasonable attempts to prevent them from doing so; and (c) Technologies, browsers, and access devices may change from time to time and our commercially reasonable attempts might or might not be effective for each Technology or across all platforms<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Uses and Disclosures of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>We may use and Process Personal Data to provide Services to you, to administer the Site, and otherwise to perform obligations, exercise rights, and further the activities for which the Personal Data was provided to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subject to applicable law, other reasons that we may use or Process your Personal Data include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>to fulfill your requests, such as to include your resume in our database(s) or to register you as a newsletter subscriber, etc.;</li>
<li>to evaluate your application for employment;</li>
<li>to create de-identified, anonymized, aggregated or similar non-personally identifiable data, which we may use for any lawful business purpose;</li>
<li>to engage in routine business uses and Disclosures that an ordinary and reasonable person should expect in the context of the Services that we provide, the reasons for which we collect Personal Data, and/or the ways that similar businesses ordinarily operate, including, for example, uses and Disclosures:</li>
<li>to meet our obligations and enforce our rights, to make Disclosures to third parties who help us (<em>e.g</em>., service providers, information technology providers, mailing and other business process providers, outsourcing providers and so on) and to operate and improve our business;</li>
<li>for security, anti-fraud, authentication and verification purposes;</li>
<li>to respond to questions or requests or to contact you for lawful purposes, including for surveys;</li>
<li>to vendors and their service providers who reasonably need the Personal Data to do their jobs;</li>
<li>to verify your identity, authority, professional history, or other information;</li>
<li>to respond to or participate in commercial disputes (<em>e.g</em>., lawsuits or investigations);</li>
<li>to persons appearing to have a lawful interest in the Personal Data (<em>e.g</em>., to an insurance company processing an insurance claim involving you); or</li>
<li>to comply with applicable law;</li>
<li>in connection with a merger or other business combination or separation (including, but not limited to, a voluntary or involuntary change in our business or structure, reorganization, sale of all or part of our stock or asset, spinoff, bankruptcy, or dissolution);&nbsp;</li>
<li>to respond to legal process or regulatory authorities (such as subpoenas; warrants; investigative demands from law enforcement, regulators or others; national or international security letters or demands; etc.);</li>
<li>to protect against fraud, claims, or other liability or harm to you, us, or others;</li>
<li>to exercise or perform a legal, ethical, contractual or other right or obligation, including enforcing agreements you have made;</li>
<li>to Third Party Services,including (without limitation) analytic data service providers (see “Third Party Services” below); and</li>
<li>for such lawful purposes as may be disclosed or evident at the time that you provide Personal Data to us (<em>e.g</em>., when you provide Personal Data in response to a survey, to sign up for an event, or to register for a newsletter).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not possible for us to list every lawful use that we might make of Personal Data, so the Disclosures described above are general, non-exclusive, illustrations.&nbsp; We reserve the right to engage in any lawful use or Disclosure of Personal Data that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Note, however, that we will not engage in any of the uses described above to the extent that they are prohibited by applicable law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may obtain separate consents from you (or provide separate disclosures to you) regarding particular uses or Disclosures of Personal Data, to the extent that we are required to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Services</strong></p>
<p>We may use third party systems and services for a variety of purposes (collectively, “Third Party Services”).&nbsp; Such third parties may collect Personal Data or other information through the Site and may have their own terms of use and privacy policies which may apply to you.&nbsp; For example, we may use third parties which may use various kinds of tracking cookies or other Technologies through our Site to collect Internet and Site usage data (such as data about where Site users come from, what they do, where they go, etc.)&nbsp; Such third party data is typically stored on that third party’s servers and analyzed by that party to provide reports and information to us.&nbsp; We do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or how they may be used. The Site, our Products, and/or our Services might link to or have functionalities that lead to other sites or services maintained by third parties.&nbsp; If you access such third-party sites or services, any information that you provide to such parties will be subject to their privacy policies and procedures and not to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; You agree, however, that if such third parties provide your Personal Data to us, this Privacy Policy will apply to what we receive.</p>
<p>Please note that the Third Party Services that we may use may change from time to time and we may need to update this Privacy Policy to reflect these changes.</p>
<p><strong>Cross Border Data Transfers</strong></p>
<p>Sharing of information sometimes involves cross-border data transfers to or from the United States of America and other jurisdictions. For example, where the Services are available to individuals in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), personal information is transferred to the United States. We use the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield and standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission to validate transfers of EEA residents’ personal information from the EEA to other countries. For more information about our Privacy Shield certification, please read our <a data-udi="umb://document/9b28f6c9f0754691b20a55d4403efdaf" href="https://www.we-worldwide.com/privacy-shield-policy" title="Privacy Shield Policy">Privacy Shield Policy</a>.&nbsp; Standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal information of EEA residents to protect the privacy and security of the transferred personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Security and Data Retention</strong></p>
<p>We use what we believe to be commercially reasonable measures intended to protect your Personal Data from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please be advised that no security measure, system, or control is infallible.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>We accordingly do not guarantee the security or confidentiality of Personal Data and disclaim any express or implied warranties, duties or conditions in that regard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Please also note that you also have a role in the security of your Personal Data.&nbsp; For example, you should not provide us with Personal Data that we do not request, you are responsible for controlling access to any personal computing device through which your Personal Data may be stored or accessed, and you are responsible for safeguarding any passwords or other log-in credentials to may be used to access to your Personal Data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us)</li>
<li>Whether a legal obligation to which we are subject applies (for example, certain laws require us to keep client records for a certain period of time before we can delete them)</li>
<li>Whether retention is advisable considering our legal position (such as, for statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your Choices about Your Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to review, correct, update, suppress, restrict or delete Personal Data that we have about you or if you would like to receive an electronic copy of your Personal Data for purposes of transmitting it to another company (if this right to data portability is provided to you by law), you can contact us at&nbsp;</p>

<p>In your request, please make clear the Personal Data that you would like us to change, whether you would like your Personal Data removed from our database or other limitations you would like to put on our use of your Personal Data.&nbsp; For your protection, we only fulfill requests for the Personal Data associated with the particular email or other contact information that you use to send us your request.&nbsp; We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request. &nbsp;We will comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that we often need to retain certain data for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transaction that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Data provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion).&nbsp; Our databases and other records may have residual data which will not be removed.&nbsp; In addition, we also may not allow you to review certain data for legal, security or other reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If at any time you believe that we have not adhered to this Privacy Policy, please let us know. We will use good faith efforts to determine and correct the problem.&nbsp; If you are an EEA resident, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080">data protection authority</a> about how we process your Personal Data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Children</strong></p>
<p>Our Site, our Products, and our Services are not directed to children under age 16 (or minors generally) and we do not knowingly collect information from minors.&nbsp; If you believe that we have received information about a child under age 16, please contact us at our “Legal Notices” address and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that Personal Data, subject to applicable law and this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>From time to time we may need to revise, supplement or replace this Privacy Policy to reflect change in our business.&nbsp; When we revise this Privacy Policy, we will post it at the “Privacy Policy” link on the Site’s home page and update the “Effective Date.”&nbsp; We also will provide you with advance notice of any material change to this Privacy Policy so that you have time to review the revised Privacy Policy.&nbsp; By using our Services after the Effective Date, you accept this Privacy Policy.</p>
