					</p>
					<p><strong>Internet Aspects: </strong>
					</p>
					<p>Personal Information may be collected when a user conducts activities on or 
						related to all websites of Covers Media Group Ltd. (see "Covers Media Group Ltd. Companies 
						Sites") or related to services made available on the Covers Media Group Ltd.
						Companies Sites. Although information collected, used or disclosed on the 
						Internet as described below often does not constitute Personal Information (and 
						to the extent that such is the case, then the obligations under the 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. Privacy Policy do not extend to such information), 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. provides the details below about Internet aspects of 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. services for the purposes of disclosure.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) </strong>
						<br>
						When the user's web browser requests a web page from another computer on the 
						Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send 
						the information. This address is called the computer's "IP address." For most 
						users accessing the Internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), 
						the IP address will be different every time the user logs on.
						<br>
						Covers Media Group Ltd. may use the user's IP Address to:
					</p>
					<p>a) Facilitate the diagnosis and remedy of a technical problem reported by the 
						user's or Covers Media Group Ltd's technical team.
					</p>
					<p>b) Display (or allow the display by Third Party advertising providers of) more 
						appropriate and relevant content and advertising, such as content and 
						advertising based on the user's geographic area.
					</p>
					<p>c) Estimate user traffic from specific countries or organizations. Many IP 
						addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers, 
						universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities. 
						Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to 
						advertisers.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Cookies </strong>
						<br>
						A cookie is a small text file, which often includes an anonymous unique 
						identifier, that is sent to the user's web browser from a web site's computers 
						and is stored on the user's computer's hard drive. Cookies cannot be used to 
						run programs or deliver viruses to a user's computer.
						<br>
						Covers Media Group Ltd. may use cookies to:
					</p>
					<p>a) Improve the operation and performance of the Covers Media Group Ltd. services and 
						to make Covers Media Group Ltd. services easier and more convenient to use. For 
						example, cookies help Covers Media Group Ltd. provide more personalized services by 
						recalling user preferences on subsequent visits (e.g. language preference). 
						Cookies also allow Covers Media Group Ltd. to save passwords and preferences for a 
						user so that the user will not have to re-enter them on the next visit to a 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. website;
					</p>
					<p>b) Measure aggregate user traffic and demographic statistics related to 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. websites and advertisements (e.g. number of users, average 
						time spent, average age and similar statistics). This information helps 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. to better understand when to update, change or offer new 
						services and provides Covers Media Group Ltd. with details as to the performance of 
						Third Party advertisements and content. This information may be reported, in 
						aggregate form only, to Covers Media Group Ltd's current and prospective sponsors, 
						advertisers and business partners. No Personal Information will be disclosed in 
						such reports;
					</p>
					<p>c) Display advertisements. Covers Media Group Ltd. and Third Party advertising 
						providers may use cookies when serving advertisements on Covers Media Group Ltd. 
						websites. In some cases, advertisements from Third Party advertisers are 
						delivered to users (in conjunction with Covers Media Group Ltd. services) by such 
						Third Party advertisers, or by separately contracted advertising providers on 
						their behalf, and not by Covers Media Group Ltd.; as such, the Third-party 
						advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. Privacy Policy, and users should consult the privacy policies 
						of such Third Party advertisers.
					</p>
					<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If a user prefers, the 
						user can reset his/her browser either to notify the user when the user has 
						received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. The user should understand 
						that while Covers Media Group Ltd. do not require a user to use cookies, certain 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. services will not function properly if a user sets his/her 
						browser to not accept cookies.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Links To Other Sites And Advertisements </strong>
						<br>
						A Covers Media Group Ltd. website may contain links to other websites and services. 
						While Covers Media Group Ltd. try to link only to sites and services that share 
						Covers Media Group Ltd's high standards and respect for privacy, a user should 
						understand that Covers Media Group Ltd. is not responsible for the content of, or the 
						privacy practices employed by, other companies or websites. This Covers Media Group
						Ltd. Privacy Policy applies only to the Covers Media Group Ltd. services related to 
						this Covers Media Group Ltd. Privacy Policy.
					</p>
					<p>The majority of the advertisements which are displayed in connection with 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. services are served through one or more reputable Third Party 
						advertisement-serving companies which deliver the advertisements to users in 
						conjunction with Covers Media Group Ltd. services. For more information about what 
						information is collected and how information is used by a major Third Party 
						advertising provider click here.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Additional Information </strong>
						<br>
						Covers Media Group Ltd. Companies automatically collect certain information about the 
						user's computer hardware and software. This information may include: browser 
						type, operating system type, domain names, access times and referring Web site 
						addresses. This information is used by Covers Media Group Ltd. to operate the 
						service, to maintain the quality of the service, and to provide general 
						statistics regarding use of the Covers Media Group Ltd. Companies Sites.
					</p>
					<p>Certain Covers Media Group Ltd. services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction 
						with another company. If a user registers for or uses such services, both 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. and the other company may receive information collected in 
						conjunction with the co-branded services.

						consent if it is clearly in the interests of the Person and consent cannot be 
						obtained in a timely way, such as when the Person is a minor, seriously ill or 
						mentally incapacitated.
					</p>
					<p>Covers Media Group Ltd. may also collect, use or disclose Personal Information without 
						knowledge or consent if seeking the consent of the Person might defeat the 
						purpose of collecting the information such as in the investigation of a breach 
						of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law.
					</p>
					<p>Covers Media Group Ltd. may also use or disclose Personal Information without 
						knowledge or consent in the case of an emergency where the life, health or

						herein.

						which it was collected.

						to:
						<br>
						a) Another person for the development, enhancement, marketing or provision of

						make a decision about a Person, Covers Media Group Ltd. shall retain, for a period of 
						time that is reasonably sufficient to allow for access by the Person, either 
						the actual information or the rationale for making the decision.
					</p>
					<p>5.6 Covers Media Group Ltd. shall maintain reasonable and systematic controls, 
						schedules and practices for information and records retention and destruction 
						which apply to Personal Information that is no longer necessary or relevant for 
						the identified purposes or required by law to be retained. Such information

					</p>
					<p><strong>Principle 6 - Accuracy of Personal Information </strong>

						destruction, through appropriate security measures. Covers Media Group Ltd. shall 
						protect the information regardless of the format in which it is held.
					</p>
					<p>7.2 Covers Media Group Ltd. shall protect Personal Information disclosed to third 
						parties by contractual agreements stipulating the confidentiality of the 
						information and the purposes for which it is to be used.
					</p>
					<p>7.3 All employees of Covers Media Group Ltd. with access to Personal Information shall

						Personal Information and have it amended as appropriate.
					</p>
					<p>9.1 Upon request, Covers Media Group Ltd. shall afford to a Person a reasonable 
						opportunity to review the Personal Information in the Person's file. Personal

						and at minimal or no cost to the Person.
					</p>
					<p>9.2 In certain situations, Covers Media Group Ltd. may not be able to provide access 
						to all of the Personal Information that they hold about a Person. For example, 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. may not provide access to information if doing so would 
						likely reveal Personal Information about a Third Party or could reasonably be 
						expected to threaten the life or security of another person. Also, Covers Media Group
						Ltd. may not provide access to information if disclosure would reveal 
						confidential commercial information, if the information is protected by 
						solicitor-client privilege, if the information was generated in the course of a 
						formal dispute resolution process, or if the information was collected in 
						relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of 
						a federal or provincial law, or if the information was collected as part of 
						journalistic, literary or artistic activities. If access to Personal 
						Information cannot be provided, Covers Media Group Ltd. shall provide the reasons for 
						denying access upon request.
					</p>
					<p>9.3 Upon request, Covers Media Group Ltd. shall provide an account of the use and

						required to provide sufficient identification information to permit

						Information and to authorize access to the individual's file. Any such 
						information shall be used only for this purpose.
					</p>
					<p>9.5 Covers Media Group Ltd. shall promptly correct or complete any Personal 
						Information found to be inaccurate or incomplete. Any unresolved differences as 
						to accuracy or completeness shall be noted in the Person's file. Where 
						appropriate, Covers Media Group Ltd. shall transmit to third parties having access to 
						the Personal Information in question any amended information or the existence 
						of any unresolved differences.

						Information by contacting a designated representative at Covers Media Group Ltd. 
						principal office.
