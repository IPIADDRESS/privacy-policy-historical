If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash and/or HTML5 cookies.</p>
<p>We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
<p><strong><em>Strictly Necessary</em></strong>. We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Service, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of shopping‑cart functionality.</p>

We give you the ability to exercise a choice regarding our sharing of your Personal Information with third parties other than our Affiliates for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. For example, when we are collecting Personal Information for specific purposes such as where you are taking a social action, we will provide an opt-in or opt-out choice regarding sharing of your Personal Information with specifically designated third parties for them to send you promotional information. We will never just provide your Personal Information from our general database with non-Affiliate third parties for them to send you direct marketing messages without you having first been given the option to opt-in or opt-out of that transfer. However, we may share your Personal Information with our Affiliates such as Participant Media without checking with you first, but California residents may obtain certain information about that as explained in <strong><a href="#privacy-rights">Section 3(h)</a></strong> below. Please note that opting in or out for the sharing of Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing is not an opt-out of social ads or the public nature of User Content (defined below). For more about how to control social ads, see <strong><a href="#deliver">Section 3(c)</a></strong>. For more information on User Content, see <strong><a href="#ugc">Section 4(a)</a></strong>. In addition, we may share the information we have collected about you (including Personal Information) for other purposes as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p id="request" style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>(a) When You Request Information From or Provide Information to Third Parties</strong>. You may be presented with an option on the Service to receive certain information and/or marketing offers directly from third parties or to have us send certain information to third parties or give them access to it. If you choose to do so, your Personal Information and other information may be disclosed to such third parties and all information you disclose will be subject to the third party privacy policies and practices of such third parties. In addition, third parties may store, collect or otherwise have access to your information when you interact with their Tracking Technologies, content, tools apps or ads on the Service or link to them from our Service. This may include using third-party tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or other third-party posting or content sharing tools and by so interacting you consent to such third party practices. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third parties and, therefore, you should review such third party privacy policies and practices of such third parties prior to requesting information from or otherwise interacting with them.</p>
<p id="provide" style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>(b) Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf</strong>. We may use third-party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of us or the Service, such as hosting the Service, designing and/or operating the Service's features, tracking the Service’s activities and analytics, and enabling us to send you special offers or perform other administrative services. We may provide these vendors with access to user information, including Device Identifiers and Personal Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for us. Third party analytics service providers may set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, separate from our Service, including your Personal Information. We are not responsible for those third-party technologies or activities arising out of them. However, some may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available <a href="#3rd-party-policy">here</a>. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties’ opt-out options.</p>
<p id="deliver" style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>(c) To Deliver Social Content and Advertising</strong>. We, and others we work with may use your Personal Information, Demographic Information and/or Usage Information we have collected in connection with the Service to target and deliver content, social action opportunities and advertisements to you and other users, on or related to our Service. Further, by using the Service, you consent to the use of your Personal Information and your Service activity information (including regarding your content consumption) in, or in connection with, sponsored content and advertisements shown to your Service connections or other users. For example, by associating your real name, username and/or Profile photo in, or in connection with, sponsored content, social action opportunities and/or advertisements (<em>e.g.</em>, Josh became a fan of Acme, Gabe signed the clean water petition you should too, Gary watched this documentary on dolphin harvesting, etc.). As an example, one of these messages about an action you have taken (<em>e.g.</em>, signing a petition) may be sent to people you have connected with on the Service via the Take Action Platform to prompt a similar action. However, we may, from time to time, offer you options to manage this type of social sharing, and we will, make reasonable good faith efforts to respect settings. However, we do not guarantee that your setting selections will be effective immediately or be error free when delivering social content and advertisements. These settings are the only way to control social ads and messaging; opting out of the sharing of your Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes is different. You can always avoid social content and ads completely by terminating your account and not using the Service.</p>
<p id="admin" style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>(d) Administrative and Legal Reasons</strong>. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we may access, use, preserve, transfer and disclose your information (including Device Identifiers and Personal Information), including disclosure to third parties: if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to: (i) protect or defend the rights, safety or property of TakePart or third parties (including through the enforcement of this Privacy Policy, our <strong>Terms of Service</strong>, and other applicable agreements and policies); or (ii) comply with legal and regulatory obligations (<em>e.g.</em>, pursuant to law enforcement inquiries, subpoenas or court orders). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, TakePart has complete discretion in electing to make or not make such disclosures, and to contest or not contest requests for such disclosures, all without notice to you.</p>
<p id="affiliates" style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>(e) Affiliates and Business Transfer</strong>. We may share your information, including your Device Identifiers and Personal Information, Demographic Information and Usage Information with our parent (Participant Media, LLC), and its and our subsidiaries and affiliates (“<strong>Affiliates</strong>”). We also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all such information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Service or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including during the course of any due diligence process.</p>
<p id="co-brand" style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>(f) Co-branded Areas</strong>. Certain areas of the Service may be provided to you in association with third parties (“<strong>Co-Branded Areas</strong>”) such as promotional partners and charities, and may require you to disclose Personal Information to them. Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party and indicate if they have a privacy policy that applies to their collection and use of you information. If you elect to register for products and/or services, communicate with such third parties or download their content or applications, at Co-Branded Areas, you may be providing your information to both us and the third party. Further, if you sign-in to a Co-Branded Area with a username and password obtained on the Service, your Personal Information may be disclosed to the identified third parties for that Co-Branded Area. We are not responsible for such third party’s data collection or practices and you should look to such third-party privacy policies for more information.</p>
<p id="sweepstakes" style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>(g) Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions</strong>. We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a “<strong>Promotion</strong>”) through the Service that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, allowing the sponsor of the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion’s official rules, such as on a winners list.</p>
<p id="privacy-rights" style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>(h) Your California Privacy Rights</strong>. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents who have supplied personal information, as defined in the statute, to us to, under certain circumstances, request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of such information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We provide the option to all of our users to exercise choice regarding this type of data transfer to non-Affiliate third parties, as more fully described above in the first paragraph of this Section 3. Please note that this direct marketing transfer choice is different from the choices you may have regarding social ads and content, which are explained in <strong><a href="#affiliates">Section 3(c)</a></strong>, or your User Content, which is explained in <strong><a href="#ugc">Section 4(a)</a></strong>. With respect to the sharing of your personal information, as defined in the statute, with our Affiliates for their own direct marketing purposes, however, we may share such information with our Affiliates such as Participant Media without checking with you first. California residents may obtain the categories of personal information shared and the names and addresses of all third parties that received such information for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately prior calendar year (<em>e.g</em>., requests made in 2013 will receive information about 2012 sharing activities). To make such a request, please provide sufficient information for us to determine if this applies to you, attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. You may make this request by writing to us at: Postal Mail: TakePart, LLC, 331 Foothill Road, 3rd Floor, Beverly Hills, CA 90210 (Attn: Privacy Coordinator); E-mail: <a href="mailto:privacy@takepart.com">privacy@takepart.com</a>.</p>
<p id="public-disclosure"><strong>4. What About Information I Disclose Publicly or to Others?</strong></p>
<p id="ugc" style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>(a) User Generated Content and Public Information</strong>. The Service may permit you to submit ideas, photographs, Profiles, writings, video, audio recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, including Personal Information (collectively, “<strong>User Content</strong>”), such as on your Profile, petitions you sign and group boards. We or others may store, display, reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed) and may or may not attribute it to you. Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties. Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including Personal Information, in connection with your User Content. Please note that we do not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. We are not responsible for the privacy or security of any information that you make publicly available on the Service or for what others do with the information you share with them. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Content that you disclose or receive from third parties through the Service.</p>
<p id="name" style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>(b) Name and Likeness</strong>. We may also publish your name, voice, likeness and other Personal Information that is part of your User Content, and we may use the content, or any portion of the content, for advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities. This includes use in connection with social content and ads as more fully explained in <strong><a href="#deliver">Section 3(c)</a></strong>. For full terms and conditions regarding User Content you submit to the Service, please review our <strong><a href="http://www.takepart.com/terms-of-use">Terms of Service</a></strong>.</p>
<p id="profile" style="margin-left:50px;"><strong>(c) Profile Settings</strong>. A user’s profile (“<strong>Profile</strong>”) page may be, by default, set up to display information such as the user’s display name, Profile photo, images, location (city/state), groups that the user has joined and optional information added by the user including, for example, the user’s tagline, photographs, social initiatives, and previous actions taken and causes supported, etc. If you register using Facebook Connect or another third party service, your Profile will be by that action populated based on what information you elect to let that service share with us. If your register directly on our Service, or supplement your Profile via the Service, you will directly enter what information your Profile will include. Profile information is used by us primarily to be presented back to you when you access the Service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information on or in connection with the Service. In some cases (<em>e.g.</em>, posting to your page), other users of the Service may be able to supplement your Profile. We may offer users the ability to manage their Profile and use Profile preference settings, the functionality and features of which are subject to change from time-to-time so visit the settings available frequently to confirm the settings reflect your then current preferences and we recommend that you do not post information or content as part of your Profile that you are not prepared to make completely public. Changing setting options may not result in immediate changes to the settings, which are subject to our operations and maintenance schedules. Changing information or preferences using third party applications like Facebook Connect, is dependent upon the performance of such third parties for which we are not responsible. Users should carefully consider the use of preference settings to improve information display options and should regularly ensure the settings are properly set and functioning in the manner desired. Notwithstanding the availability of Profile preference settings, you should be aware that these settings are for convenience only, do not employ complex data security protection and may not be error free. Further, other users that have access may repost or otherwise make public your information or content. Accordingly, discretion and good judgment should be exercised when posting information or content as part of your Profile.</p>
<p id="3rd-party-content"><strong>5. Do Third-Party Content and Links To Third-Party Sites Appear on the Service?</strong></p>
<p>The Service may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your Device Identifier when pages from the Service are served to you. In addition, when you are on the Service you may be directed to other services such as applications that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or their services and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others. For example, if you “click” on a link, the “click” may take you off the Service onto a different service. These other sites may have their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies and ask you to agree to the same as well as associate their Tracking Technologies with you, independently collect data about you, including Personal Information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. We encourage you to note when you leave our Service and to review the third-party privacy policies of all third-party locations and exercise caution in connection with them.</p>
<p id="ads"><strong>6. Ads and Information About You</strong></p>
<p>The Service may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements on and off of the Service and may use third-party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of the Service and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits and activities across the Internet and mobile media (“<strong>Behavioral Ads</strong>”). In addition, we may serve ads on our Service based on your Usage Information from your activities on our Service (“<strong>Contextual Ads</strong>”). Behavioral Ads and Contextual Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. If you object to Contextual Ads, do not use our Service. If you object to Behavioral Ads from us on third-party sites, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below.</p>
<p>Our third-party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies (including Flash cookies), web beacons and other Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier. These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.</p>
<p>Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they are used to serve our ads or interact with our Service. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party’s terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.</p>
<p id="ad-choices">However, some third parties we work with may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available <strong><a href="#3rd-party-policy">here</a></strong>. Further, while we and third-party sites that display our ads may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“<strong>NAI</strong>”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, which will affect this and other sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Therefore, if you use multiple Devices or multiple browsers on a single Device, you need to opt-out by clicking the orange opt-out icon for each browser that you use on your Device. Additionally, if you delete your cookies, change browsers, or use a different Device, you will need to opt-out again. Additional information is available on the NAI’s web site accessible by the above link. Where we serve third-party Behavioral Ads on the <a href="http://www.takepart.com/terms-of-use">Service</a> we participate in the notice and opt-out program run by the Digital Advertising Alliance (“<strong>DAA</strong>”), and you can learn more about it and the opt-out choices it offers at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed</a>. Where we serve our own Behavioral Ads on third-party sites, we request that they comply with the DAA program so that you have the same notice and opt-out choice. Please note that similar limitations as described regarding NAI opt-out may apply to the DAA opt-out. In the event that we allow third parties to display advertisements that are directly targeted at users in the EU, please visit <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com" target="_blank">http://www.youronlinechoices.com</a> to learn more about your options. Similar limitations may apply to these opt-out methods. Although we take commercial reasonable efforts to comply with the DAA Behavioral Ad Principles, we are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs.</p>
<p id="communication-preferences"><strong>7. How Do I Change My Information and Communications Preferences?</strong></p>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information we receive about you, such as your contact information provided as part of registration and Profile creation. When you use Facebook Connect, or another third party service, to sign in or sign up changes you make to that third party account that information you have elected to have that third party share with us when you activated that service on our Services should automatically update your account, however, since we do not control Facebook or other third party services, we cannot be responsible for this occurring promptly or accurately. If you terminate your Facebook account, your ability to access your account on our Service via Facebook Connect will no longer be available, and the same applies with respect to other third party services. To the extent we allow account registrations directly on our Service (i.e., other than by means of Facebook Connect or other third party services), the Service will also include functionality to allow you to review, correct or update your registration and Profile. If you utilize this functionality, we will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons. Also, if you have made any public postings on the Service such as User Content in forums or blogs, these communications cannot generally be removed. When you edit your Personal Information or change your preferences on the Service, information that you remove may persist internally for our administrative purposes. You may cancel or modify our e-mail marketing communications you receive from us by following the instructions contained within our promotional e-mails or in some cases by logging into your Service Account and changing your communication preferences. This will not affect subsequent subscriptions and if your opt-out is limited to certain types of e-mails the opt-out will be so limited. If you subscribe to text messages from us, you can terminate a particular text message subscription by reply texting “STOP.” Subsequent or different subscriptions will be unaffected. Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your account or use of our Service, such as administrative and service announcements and these transactional account messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from receiving our marketing communications. If you have any questions about the Privacy Policy or practices described in it, you should contact us in the following ways: Postal Mail: TakePart, LLC, 331 Foothill Road, 3rd Floor, Beverly Hills, California 90210 (Attn: Privacy Coordinator); By e-mail: <a href="mailto:privacy@takepart.com">privacy@takepart.com</a>.</p>
<p id="information-transfer"><strong>8. What About Transfer of Information to the United States?</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is operated in the United States and intended for users located in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including Personal Information, will be transferred to, and processed, stored and used in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your Personal Information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States. By using the Service or providing us with any information, you consent to the transfer to, and processing, usage, sharing and storage of your information, including Personal Information, in the United States as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p id="children"><strong>9. What Should Parents Know About Children?</strong></p>
<p>The Service is intended for general audiences and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children younger than the age of thirteen (13) as required by U.S. law. We will delete any Personal Information collected that we later determine to be from a user younger than the age of thirteen (13). If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen (13) and believe he or she has disclosed Personal Information to us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@takepart.com">privacy@takepart.com</a>.</p>
<p id="security"><strong>10. What About Security?</strong></p>
<p>We incorporate commercially reasonable safeguards to help protect and secure your Personal Information. However, no data transmission over the Internet, mobile networks, wireless transmission or electronic storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use our Service and provide us with your information at your own risk.</p>
<p id="changes"><strong>11. What About Changes to the Privacy Policy?</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy. However, we will not use your previously collected Personal Information in a manner materially different than represented at the time it was collected without your consent. To the extent any provision of this Privacy Policy is found by a competent tribunal to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed to the extent necessary for the remainder to be valid and enforceable.</p>
