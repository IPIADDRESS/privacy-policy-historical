    <p><a name="pp1"></a>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age; and that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our Web sites. Below we explain how we do that for these "kids." Also, when we use the term "parent" below, we mean to include legal guardians.</p>

										<td class="copy">Kids can surf, view content, without any personal information being collected. We do not collect personal information from kids unless they sign into the Undercover Reporter Form. Typically, kids will "sign in" in order to participate in sweepstakes or contests or to participate in a special activity. The only information we collect from kids during our registration process is a kid's  name, parent's e-mail address, birth date, phone number, and "news". We collect birth dates to validate the ages of our guests, including kids. We do not collect any other personally identifiable information from kids during our registration process. Note that all sites that are directed to children under 13 are prohibited by law from conditioning a kid's participation in an online activity on the kid's providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary.<br>
										  <br>
We may collect personal information from parents in order to allow kids to participate in certain features located on our Web site.  In the course of a kid's participation  a kid may also provide us additional information about himself or herself, such as the contents of his or her chat or message board postings. If a parent allows us to collect personal information about their kid, we may link certain information collected through technology (see the "Information Collected Through Technology" section of A2 of our general Privacy Policy) to that personal information.

In addition, personal information regarding a kid may be disclosed in the course of a kid's participation in certain interactive features such as message boards and pen pal services.<br>
										  <br>
We do not share any information about a kid with any other  third parties unless the disclosure is reasonably necessary: to comply with law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our Terms of Service, or site or game rules; or to protect the safety and security of our Guests and our Web sites.

									  <td class="copy">We send parents an e-mail when their kid registers and enters a sweepstakes or contest and we provide parents 48 hours to refuse their kid's registration and entry in the sweepstakes or contest. If the parent refuses to allow the kid's registration and entry, we delete the kid's information from our database. If we don't hear back from the parent, we assume it is acceptable for the kid to be registered and entered in the sweepstakes or contest. Once a parent permits a kid to register, the kid will be able to enter future registration-based sweepstakes or contests without any further notification to the parent. If a kid wins a sweepstakes or contest, we notify the parent at the parent's e-mail address provided to us during the registration process and request that the parent provide their postal address for purposes of delivering the prize. We may publish a winner's first name, first initial of last name, city, and state of residence on our Web sites.</td>
