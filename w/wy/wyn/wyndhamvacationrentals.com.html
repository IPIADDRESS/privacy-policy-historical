Other information we collect about you:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Cookies:</strong> Our Services may use "cookies" and similar technologies (collectively, "cookies"). Cookies are small text files this Website sends to your computer for record-keeping purposes and stores this information in a file on your computer's hard drive. Cookies make web surfing and browsing easier for you by saving your preferences so we can use these to improve your next visit to our Website.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;One purpose of cookies is to simplify the use of the Website. For example, cookies may save a user's login details, so they do not need to login every time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies may be either "persistent" or "temporary" (or "session") cookies. A persistent cookie retains user preferences for a particular Website allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions and remains valid until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date). A temporary cookie, on the other hand, expires at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies are also used for statistical or marketing purposes, to determine how the Website is used. These cookies are provided by us or by third parties (e.g., advertising partners). While we do not control or have access to the advertiser cookies we do permit them to be used on this Website to facilitate tailored advertising and monitor patterns of buying specific goods or interest in - for example, holidays or hobbies. These cookies run advertisements tailored to the user based on his online buying habits.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to help us better understand how visitors use this Website and to facilitate interest based advertising associated with your Google Account and other devices you use. The information generated by the Google Analytics cookie about your use of this Website is transmitted to and stored by Google. If you do not want your activity on this Website to be tracked by Google Analytics, you may opt out via this link: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Pixels, Beacons:</strong> We, our third party service providers or third party ad servers may use invisible pixels or beacons on this Website to collect information concerning user interactions with the Website, such as count how many users visit certain pages, track keypresses or mouse location, movements or clicks on the Website. We may use this information to diagnose Website technical problems, improve our marketing programs and content, and to target advertisements at this Website and/or on other sites.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>From Other Sources:</strong> We may receive your Personal Information from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, data firms, social media platforms, from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms, as well as from other third parties. For example, if you elect to connect your social media account to your Website account, certain Personal Information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include Personal Information that is part of your public profile or your friends' public profiles.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Mobile Devices:</strong> When you use or access our Services from a mobile device, we may collect information such as your unique device ID and your location. If you download and use an App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number, as well as any other Personal Information specified by the App in its terms or notices.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Do Not Track Signals:</strong> At this time, we do not respond to browser ‘do not track' signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted. Third parties, including our service providers, may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites, including when you visit our website.

To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags). They may also use these technologies, along with information they collect about your online use, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile phone and a laptop.
