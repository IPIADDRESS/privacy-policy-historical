<p>Welcome to the <strong>Wyndham Vacation Rentals</strong> North America website (<strong>"Website"</strong>), controlled and operated by  the following entities: The Resort Company, LLC and Wyndham Vacation Rentals North America, LLC.&nbsp; For purposes of this Website, the  entities mentioned above are collectively referred to as “<strong>WVR</strong>”.&nbsp; WVR recognizes the  importance of protecting the privacy of certain Information collected about the  users and visitors ("<strong>user</strong>,"  "<strong>you</strong>" or "<strong>your</strong>") of WVR's website ("<strong>Website</strong>"). This Privacy Statement discloses  and describes what Information WVR may gather about you, how WVR may use such  Information, to whom it may be disclosed, and how you can correct or change  such Information ("<strong>Privacy Statement</strong>").  This Privacy Statement is designed to give you an understanding about how WVR  collects your Information and the uses WVR may make of such Information during  the course of WVR's business and in providing you with access to the  information, products and services that may be available at this Website. </p>
<p>
  In this Privacy Statement, "Personal  Information" means any information about you from which you can be  personally identified, including, without limitation, your name, address,  telephone number, email address, financial details, username, password and  other information which you may disclose. &nbsp;Certain capitalized terms used in this Privacy  Statement may be defined in WVR's separate Website Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>
  <strong>YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY  STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p>
  By using this Website, you signify your agreement  to the terms of WVR's Internet Privacy Statement. <strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH  THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE.</strong> &nbsp;Please print a copy of this Privacy Statement  for your records.&nbsp; Please note, however,  that WVR may update and amend this Privacy Statement from time to time, as it  deems necessary in its sole discretion.&nbsp; Your  continued use of WVR's Website following the posting of any updates or changes  to this Privacy Statement’s terms will signify your acceptance of those updates  and changes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
  <strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>
  WVR's purpose in establishing this Privacy  Statement is to balance its legitimate business interests in collecting and  using its users' Information with their reasonable expectations of privacy. WVR's  intent is to provide its users certain offers, information, services and  discounts that it believes are relevant to their interests. WVR believes its  users will benefit from promotional activity based on certain information  employed to market goods and services offered by and through its businesses.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
  <strong>Affiliate Websites</strong></p>
<p>
  This Privacy Statement applies to this Website and  WVR entities’ operations only. To the extent you link from this Website to sites  of WVR's affiliated or related entities, or its providers, separate privacy policies  and terms apply to those sites that may be different from this Privacy  Statement. <strong>Your access to and use of such linked sites are exclusively &nbsp;governed by their privacy policies, and WVR  disclaims any and all responsibility for your access to and use of such linked sites,  including for any use of the Information you provide to those linked sites, or  that they collect about you.</strong></p>
<p>
  <strong>What Information Does WVR Collect? </strong></p>
<p>
  WVR gathers three types of Information about its  users: (1) data users provide through optional, voluntary registration on WVR's  Website; (2) data from third party sources or providers; and (3) data gathered through  aggregated anonymous tracking of use activity and trends, mainly by tallying &nbsp;user page views on this Website. You should be  assured, however, that WVR will not disclose any of your Personal Information  (as defined above) to third parties without your consent, except as may  otherwise be described in this Privacy Statement or disclosed to you when you  submit the Personal Information.</p>
<p>
  Where you provide information that relates to a  person other than yourself, you must ensure it is lawful for you to do so, and  that if required, you have obtained that person’s permission.&nbsp; WVR will also use their information as  described in this Privacy Statement. </p>
<p>
  <strong>How Does WVR Collect Information? </strong></p>
<p>
  <strong>Optional Registration:</strong></p>
<p>
  WVR collects Information by specifically requesting  it from you. Generally, this occurs when you register at the Website, make a  reservation, request information about a service or product or subscribe to any  WVR communications. You may elect, at your sole option, whether to provide the  requested Information, although you may not be able to use or gain access to  certain portions or features of this Website if you elect not to provide it. Usually,  WVR and/or its business partners use your Information to operate the Website  and deliver information and products and services to you. WVR also uses your  Information to inform you about other products and/or services available from WVR,  its affiliated or related entities, and/or its providers.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Information from Third Party Sources:</strong></p>
<p>
  WVR may collect information about you from third  party sources to supplement the Information you provided at this Website. This allows  WVR to verify the Information you provided and to enhance WVR's ability to  provide you with information about its businesses, products and services, as  further described in WVR's Website Terms. WVR's agreements with these third  party sources typically limit how WVR may use this supplemental information.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Use of Aggregate Tracking Information:</strong></p>
<p>
  <u>Internet  Protocol ("IP") Addresses</u>:&nbsp;  An IP address is a unique number automatically assigned to your computer  whenever you are browsing the Internet so that your computer can be identified  by the main computers, known as "Web servers," that "serve  up" websites and pages. This IP address allows WVR to identify and gather  general information and data about users, such as the pages that users may  view.</p>
<p>
  WVR collects IP addresses to: (1) help WVR diagnose  and resolve problems with its main computers; (2) administer its systems and  this Website; (3) report aggregated anonymous information to its business  partners and providers; and (4) audit use of this Website. When users request pages  from this Website, WVR's servers log their IP address. WVR does not normally  link IP addresses to any Personal Information, so that a user's session will be  logged, but they will remain anonymous to WVR. For example, WVR collects and/or  tracks the home server domain name, the type of computer and browser used to  access this Website. Such collection and tracking information is gathered by WVR  as you navigate through this Website and the various pages in it.</p>
<p>
  WVR can and will use IP addresses to identify you  when WVR feels it is necessary to enforce compliance with its Website Terms  and/or this Privacy Statement, or to protect its services, Website, systems,  information, employees, business partners, providers, users, customers or  others.</p>
<p>
  <u>Cookies</u>:&nbsp; WVR  may place "cookies" on your browser. Cookies are small pieces of  information or text files a website sends to your computer and stores in a file  on your hard drive. Cookies make browsing easier by saving your preferences so  that websites can use the cookie to facilitate your use of, and improve your  experience with, the site when you navigate through it or return to it.  Cookies, by themselves, do not provide WVR with your individual identity or  Personal Information unless you have chosen separately to provide it to WVR. WVR  never saves passwords or credit card information in its cookies. The use of  cookies is industry-standard and, as such, you will find that most major websites  use them.</p>
<p>
  By showing, tracking or recording how and when  users use this Website, cookies help WVR see which areas are popular and which  are not. Manyupdates to the Website and user experience enhancements are based  on information from cookies in conjunction with user and page view totals. </p>
<p>
  Most cookies expire after a defined period of time,  or you can delete or disable your cookie file(s) at any time. Most browsers are  initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse  cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Some parts or features of WVR's  Website or services may not function properly, be accessible or may be  considerably slower if you delete or refuse to accept cookies. For example,  without cookies, you will not be able to set certain personalized preferences,  and/or may have difficulty completing marketing or other Website transactions.</p>
<p>
  WVR has two (2) primary uses for cookies. First, to  identify and specify a user's preferences; and second, &nbsp;to track Website usage trends and patterns.  This helps WVR to better understand its users' needs and to improve this Website.  While both these uses and related activities are dependent on using cookies,  you have the option, as described above, of disabling, deleting or refusing the  cookies via your browser preferences or similar features.</p>
<p>
  In addition, you may occasionally receive cookies  from WVR's business partners or providers, or when you link to other third  party sites. WVR does not control these cookies, and disclaims any  responsibility relating to the use or receipt of such cookies. You should note  that the use of advertising cookies sent by third party servers is a standard  practice in the Internet industry.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Pixels</strong></p>
<p>
  WVR and its third party ad servers may use  invisible pixels or beacons on this Website to count how many users visit  certain pages. This information is collected and reported in the aggregate  without the use of Personal Information. WVR may use this information to  improve marketing programs and content, and to target its advertisements at  this Website and/or other sites.</p>
<p>
  <strong>With Whom Does WVR Share Information?</strong></p>
<p>
  As a general rule, WVR will not share with or  disclose to any third parties any Personal Information you may submit or  provide to WVR via this Website, in a manner that connects you with it, except  (a) as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement, (b) when WVR has your  permission ora as needed to complete a transaction you requested, or (c) under  special circumstances, such as when WVR believes in good faith that the law  requires such disclosure or under the circumstances described below. The  following describes some of the ways that your Personal Information may be  disclosed:</p>
<p>
  <u>Affiliates</u>: WVR may share any or all of your  Personal Information with and among its affiliated or related entities or  family of companies. This is typically done so as to allow such entities and  companies to offer to you information about their respective businesses,  products and services that they believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>
  <u>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors</u>: WVR may  disclose some or all of your Personal Information to third party business  partners or sponsors, as described elsewhere in this Privacy Statement. In the  event and to the extent that there are additional uses of your Personal  Information by WVR's business partners or sponsors (which additional uses are  not otherwise described in or contemplated by this Privacy Statement), any such  additional uses will be specifically described to you prior to or at the time  such Personal Information is collected or prior to any transfer of such  Personal Information to the business partners or sponsors. Many promotions  offer opportunities for you to request additional information from such  business partners and sponsors. By requesting additional information, you  signify your consent to WVR's transfer of your Personal Information to the  applicable business partners or sponsors so that they can respond to or fulfill  your request. Although in many instances only your email address will be shared  with these business sponsors and partners, WVR is not limited to the type of  Personal Information that it may disclose, provided that you requested the  additional information and WVR otherwise complied with this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>
  <u>Third Party &amp; Aggregate Data</u>: From time  to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers  from third parties. If you opt to receive from these third parties information  related to such materials or offers, WVR will (with your permission) share your  name and email address with such third parties. Under confidentiality  agreements, WVR may match Personal Information with data provided by these  third parties. Also, as described above, WVR may keep track of which portions  of the Website users are visiting and other user statistics, and aggregate this  information to help WVR create a better Website user experience. This is all  done without knowing your Personal Information, and allows WVR (in addition to  other lawful purposes) to describe its users' preferences, and the types of  services in which they may be interested, to its business partners,  advertisers, sponsors and other third parties.</p>
<p>
  <u>Other</u>: WVR may also disclose account  information in special cases when it has reason to believe such disclosure is  necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be  violating the Website Terms or this Privacy Statement, or may be causing injury  to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with any of WVR's  rights or property, other users, or anyone else. WVR may disclose or access  account information when it believes in good faith that the law requires it  (and/or if compelled to do so by law enforcement or government agencies, or by  other legal action, including without limit a warrant, subpoena or court order),  and for administrative and other purposes it deems necessary to maintain,  service, and/or improve this Website or its products and services.&nbsp; We may also share information when we have a  good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity,  to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to prevent harm to WVR, the Website or our  customers.&nbsp; This may include sharing  information with other companies, lawyers, courts, government entities or law  enforcement.</p>
<p>
  <u>Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of  Control</u>:&nbsp; If the ownership of all or  substantially all of any WVR entities’ business changes or such entity otherwise  transfers assets relating to its business or the Website to a third party, your  personal information may be transferred to the new owner to be used consistent  with this Privacy Statement.&nbsp; In such  case, your information would remain subject to terms consistent with this  Privacy Statement. </p>
<p>
  <strong><u>Children</u>:  This Website is not intended for use by children. WVR does not knowingly  solicit or collect Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If  you are under the age of 18, you must obtain the consent of your parent or  guardian to use this Website.&nbsp; If you are  a parent or guardian and believe your child has submitted Personal Information  to us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@wynvr.com">privacy@wynvr.com</a>, so  that we may delete it from our records.</strong></p>
<p>
  <strong>Opting Out; How Can You Control the Use of  Information?</strong></p>
<p>
  Should you decide you want to opt out from WVR's  use of any Personal Information you previously provided to (and/or authorized  for use by) WVR, or if any of your Personal Information (such as your zip code  or email address) changes, you may follow the procedure below. WVR makes  periodic efforts to verify the accuracy of your Personal Information and to  correct and update its databases based on the information available to it. In  the event you believe any Personal Information held by WVR is inaccurate or  outdated, WVR, upon notification and sufficient time for verification, will  take all reasonable steps to correct any inaccuracy or update outdated Personal  Information of which it is made aware. WVR also gives you the opportunity to  control or opt out from the communications WVR directs to you. You  may not be able to opt out concerning retention of certain Personal Information  you previously provided that WVR needs for business or legal purposes,  including without limit Personal Information submitted in connection with a  reservation, or that relates to your use of any products or services.</p>
<p>
  You can also ask to access any of the Personal  Information we hold about you. These rights are in addition to your rights to  request that your Personal Information is updated or corrected or is not used  for direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p>
  If you would like to opt out from any use or  communication described in this Privacy Statement, or change or update your  Personal Information, you may request this by contacting us at: <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:privacy@wynvr.com"><strong>privacy@wynvr.com</strong></a></p>

  <strong>What Happens When You Link to a Third Party  Site?</strong></p>
<p>
  You should be aware that when you are on WVR's Website,  you may be able to hyperlink, or may be directed to third party websites beyond  WVR's control and/or outside of its services. For example, if you  "click" on a banner advertisement or a WVR search result, the  "click" may transfer you off this Website to another unaffiliated site.  These other sites may include material of advertisers, sponsors, providers  and/or partners that may use WVR's and/or WVR's affiliated or related entities'  logos as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own  cookies to, or collect or solicit Information from, users. WVR does not control  such third parties or their sites, and is not responsible for their content or  the links or advertising placed on them. WVR's inclusion in this Website of links  to third party sites does not imply any endorsement of the material on those sites  or any association with the third party operators. This Privacy Statement does  not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet and/or  that is beyond WVR's control.</p>
<p>
  Please keep in mind that whenever you give out  information over the Internet or otherwise in online environments (for example,  via message boards or forums), it can be collected and used by people you do  not know. While WVR strives to protect users' information and privacy, it cannot  guarantee the security of any information you disclose in these environments,  and you disclose such information at your own risk.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Where is your information?</strong></p>
<p>
  All Personal Information will be processed and  stored by WVR in the United    States. United States laws regarding  processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your  jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Is Your Information Secure?</strong></p>
<p>
  The security of all Information associated with  users of this Website is an important concern to WVR. WVR exercises reasonable  care in providing secure transmission of your Information from your computer to  WVR's servers and databases. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the  Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while WVR strives to  protect your Information, WVR cannot ensure or warrant the security of any  Information you transmit to WVR, and you do so at your own risk. Once you  complete the transmission of, and WVR receives, your Information, WVR uses  industry standard efforts and practices to safeguard the confidentiality of  your Personal Information, and uses commercially reasonable efforts to collect  and secure such Personal Information consistent with all applicable laws and  regulations. WVR takes commercially reasonable efforts to use a variety of  different security measures (such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers)  designed to protect Personal Information from access by unauthorized users both  inside and outside of WVR, and to protect against the unauthorized or improper  alteration or destruction of such Personal Information. WVR's communication  system, software and database practices have been designed to aid in supporting  authenticity, integrity and confidentiality. However, as described above,  "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet and, despite these  reasonable efforts by WVR to maintain data and Information security, WVR cannot  guarantee the security of data or Information.</p>
