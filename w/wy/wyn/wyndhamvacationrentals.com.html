Cookies are small text files this Website sends to your computer for record-keeping purposes and this information is stored in a file on your computer's hard drive. Cookies make web surfing and browsing easier for you by saving your preferences so we can use them to improve your next visit to this Website.<br>&nbsp;<br>
    •&nbsp;&nbsp;One purpose of cookies is to simplify the use of the Website.  A cookie may save a user's login details for example, so the user does not need to login every time. Cookies, by themselves, do not provide us with your personal information.<br>&nbsp;<br>
    •&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies may be either "persistent" or "temporary" (or "session") cookies.  A persistent cookie retains user preferences for a particular Website allowing them to be used in future browsing sessions and remains valid until its set expiry date (unless previously deleted by the user). A temporary cookie expires at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.<br>&nbsp;<br>
    •&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies are also used for statistical or marketing purposes, to determine how the Website is used. These cookies are provided by us as well as third parties (e.g., advertising partners). While we do not control or have access to the advertiser cookies we do permit them to be used on this Website to facilitate tailored advertising and to monitor patterns of buying specific goods or interest in - for example, holidays or hobbies.  These cookies run advertisements tailored to users based on their online buying habits.<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to help us better understand how visitors use this Website.  The information generated by the Google Analytics cookie about your Website use is transmitted to and stored by Google. If you do not want your activity on this Website to be tracked by Google Analytics, you may opt out by using this link: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a><br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Pixels, Beacons:</strong> We or third party ad servers may use invisible pixels or beacons on this Website to count how many users visit certain pages.  This information is collected and reported in the aggregate.  We may use this information to improve our marketing programs and content, and to target advertisements at this Website and/or on other sites.<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>From Other Sources:</strong> We may receive your personal information from other sources, such as public databases; joint marketing partners; data firms; social media platforms; from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms, as well as from other third parties.<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Mobile Devices:</strong> When you use or access our Services from a mobile device, we may collect information such as your unique device ID and your location information.
