<p>Maranatha Broadcasting Company, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to
demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information
gathering and dissemination practices for this site; www.wfmz.com.</p>

<p>Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. We use cookies to save
your Stormcenter Update password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our
site for school closing information.</p>

<p>Our site's Stormcenter Update registration form requires users to give us contact
information (like their email address). We use customer contact information from the
registration form to process the information about school closings. The information is
also used to contact you in case of difficulty with your request.</p>

<p>We may run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like
their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income
level). Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to
tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might
be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This site
contains links to other sites. www.wfmz.com is not responsible for the privacy practices
or the content of such Web sites.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you
visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to
track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is
information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read
cookie files created by other sites. WFMZ uses a cookie only when you register for
Stormcenter Update information.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We use this cookie to get your Stormcenter Update information faster, without having to
enter your login and password each time you check for updates.</p>

<h2>Use of IP addresses</h2>

<p>The WFMZ Web site also logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes. IP
addresses are logged to track a user's session. This gives us an idea of which parts of
our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally
identifiable. This means that a users session will be tracked, but the user will be
anonymous. </p>

<p>This site gives users the following options for removing their information from our
database to not receive future communications or to no longer receive our service.
