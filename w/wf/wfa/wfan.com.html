Please see the separate privacy policy for the CBS Radio Inc./Monster.com Promotion.  <br><br><b>WFAN PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</b><br><br><br>WFAN (“Site,” “us,” or “we”) is the official website for Radio Station WFAN, Sports Radio 66. (“Station”).  This Site is owned and operated by WFAN (“Owner and Operator”) a subsidiary of CBS Radio Inc.  <br><br>Your privacy is very important to us.  Because we gather certain types of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) from users of our website and for various Station activities, operational and business purposes, we feel you should know how we collect, use, disclose,  manage, and store the Personal Information that you may voluntarily provide us and the Personal Information that is collected passively through the use of cookies or image tags on our website.  This Privacy Policy is a part of the Site’s Terms of Use Agreement, which is binding on all Site users.  <a href="http://www.wfan.com/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a> This Policy applies only to the Personal Information collected by this Station and does not cover any such information collected by its corporate parent(s), affiliates, or any other company, unless specifically stated. <br><br>If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Station’s online or off-line activities and services that require you to provide your Personal Information.  (The type of Personal Information collected is listed below.)  This Policy provides information regarding your choices to either Opt-out or Opt-in when your Personal Information is used for various promotional and marketing purposes by the Station, Site, its corporate affiliates, and/or our generous advertisers, sponsors, or promotional partners (collectively, “Advertisers”).  For example, for the Station, Site or our corporate affiliates use of your Personal Information for marketing and promotional purposes, we provide you with the right to Opt-out.  However, the choice for sharing your Personal Information with Advertisers may be different.  Please see details in the “Disclosure to Advertisers “ section below.      <br><br><a name="california"></a><b>Your California Privacy Rights</b><br><br>Residents of the State of California, under a new provision of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes.  Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an Opt-out or Opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.  <br><br>This Station qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with details on how you may Opt-out or Opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes.  Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information during the preceding year for marketing purposes.<br><br>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail).  You may contact us in two ways. Send email to <a href="mailto:wfanpromotions@wfan.com">Privacy Administrator</a>.  Alternatively, you may contact the Station at:<br> <br>Sports Radio 66 WFAN<br>WFAN.com<br>34-12 36th Street<br>Astoria, NY 11106<br>Attn: Your California Privacy Rights<br>c/o Privacy Administrator<br><br>For requests sent via email, you must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field of your email.  All requests sent via postal mail must be labeled “Your California Privacy Rights” on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request.  For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code.  (Your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email. Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping.)  We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.  <br><br>To all other users of this Site, if you have other questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact our Privacy Administrator at the following email address: wfanpromotions@wfan.com or:<br><br>Sports Radio 66 WFAN<br>WFAN.com<br>34-12 36th Street<br>Astoria, NY 11106<br>Attn: Privacy Administrator<br><br>Unless specified otherwise on the Site, all users must be at least 18 years of age and a legal resident of the United States to participate in any activity that requires the submission of Personal Information.  This Site is designed and targeted to United States (U.S.) audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of  the United States.  We make no representation that this Site is operated in accordance with the laws or governed by other nations. By your participation in our Site activities, you certify that you are at least 18 years of age and located in the U.S.  If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the U.S. and you participate in activities on this Site contrary to our policy that only U.S. residents are eligible for certain activities, you do so at your own risk and initiative, and are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws.  Please be aware that any Personal Information you transfer to us will be transferred to the U.S and subject to U.S. law.  By using this Site, participating in any Site activities, and/or providing us with your Personal Information, you consent to this transfer of Personal Information to the U.S., and waive any claims that may arise under your own national laws.  All users of the Site are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal Information when prompted and we will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false, fraudulent, or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.  <br><br>Your continued participation on this Site indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure,  management and storage of your Personal Information as described below.   We may from time to time, transfer or merge any Personal Information collected off-line to our online databases or store off-line information in an electronic format. We may also combine Personal Information we collect online with information available from other sources, including information received from Advertisers, or marketing companies.  This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site or a participant in Station activities.  We reserve the right to revise this policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice to you.  Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting.  Therefore, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy often.  <br><br><a name="collection"></a><b>Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</b><br><br>Generally, you may browse this Site without providing any Personal Information.  For certain activities (such as contest and sweepstakes registrations, membership, awards points and loyal listener clubs, nominations for civic or Best Teacher/Coach awards, or registration for chat rooms and message boards) the Personal Information you voluntarily provide may include your first/middle and last name, home address, business address, email address, telephone number, age, birthdate, gender, employer or personal preferences, depending on the activity.  Your Personal Information will be used to implement the specific activity or event and will be used for the marketing of additional events, services and merchandising for this Site and WFAN Sports Radio 66.<br><br><a name="advertising">We will not sell, exchange, rent, lease or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to other third-party marketers or any such persons that are not associated with the Station as an advertiser, sponsor, or promotional partner (collectively “Advertisers”) unless it is necessary to 1) conform to regulatory and legal requirements or to comply with legal process, 2) to protect the safety and security of our users, employees, or property, 3) to defend the rights of the Site or the Station, or 4) to enforce the Terms of Use Agreement.  (Specifics on how we may share your information with Advertisers are explained below.)  </a><br><br>It is necessary that we share your Personal Information with our operational service providers, the specialists that provide internal support to our Site design, development, hosting and operations including maintenance, management, storage and/or fulfillment of our membership and e-mail clubs, various contests, sweepstakes, services, events and online stores.  We use operational service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, activities and membership services we bring to you and we request that our operational service providers also protect your privacy and not disclose your personal information with third-party marketers that are not associated with the Station or website.  <br><br>Furthermore, we reserve the right to disclose any and all membership and visitor databases collected by the website, in the event that the assets or stock of WFAN, its corporate licensee or parent company are sold or transferred to, or merged with a different company or entity, and to contact you at any time regarding the administration of the Site, its various activities and your membership.  <br><br>We explain below what our policy is for the collection, use and disclosure of users’ Personal Information for the Site and Advertisers.  <br><br>Advertising support allows us to offer, free of charge, many great activities and services to our users such as contests, sweepstakes and special events.  Therefore, we may also use your Personal Information for the marketing of events, products or services of our generous Advertisers.  There are two ways users may receive such information from Advertisers, either indirectly via newsletters, email or direct mail from the Site, or directly from the Advertiser.  We may use one or both methods depending on the activity and the Advertiser.  <br><br>When we plan to share your information with Advertisers, you will receive such notice on the Site and/or in the rules of participation (“Rules of Participation”) for the activity or event.  However, please be informed that our Advertisers may not have the same privacy policies that we do.  Therefore, we will ask you for your consent first to receive marketing information directly from our Advertisers.  You will need to check the “Opt-in” click boxes so indicated on the registration area for the particular activity or event, or notify the Site’s Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:wfanpromotions@wfan.com">wfanpromotions@wfan.com</a>.

Cookies are a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a website to the hard drive of a user’s computer so that the website administrator may identify the computer and passively track the user’s activities on the website.  Image tags work in conjunction with cookies and are small image files that may be located on select pages of our Site, or with-in web-based email newsletters that we may send.  (Image tags are also called web beacons, web bugs, clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs.)  Tracking is important because we can better understand what parts of our website are used the most, when to launch new services and how to enhance current offerings.  We may share the information we receive from cookies and image tags with third-parties and our Advertisers in aggregate form, which means that such information does not contain specific Personal Information about any one visitor.<br><br>In short, cookies and image tags collect a user’s Internet protocols and server information.

We do not use cookies or image tags to collect other Personal Information unless you give us permission to do so.<br><br>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie or image tag is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all such devices.
