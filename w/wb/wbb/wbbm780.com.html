                                There are two ways users may receive such marketing 
                                information from Advertisers, either indirectly 
                                via newsletters, email or direct mail from the 
                                Site, or directly from the Advertiser. We primarily 
                                provide such information from our Advertisers 
                                on an indirect basis, through the station or website. 
                                However, on occasion for special events or contests 
                                an Advertiser may wish to provide marketing information 
                                directly to you. The following are the procedures 
                                we will take when an Advertiser wants to contact 
                                you directly.</p>
                              <p>When we plan to share your information with Advertisers, 
                                you will receive such notice on the Site and/or 
                                in the rules of participation (“Rules of 
                                Participation”) for the activity or event. 
                                However, please be informed that our Advertisers 
                                may not have the same privacy policies that we 
                                do. Therefore, you will need to tell us if you 
                                do not want to receive marketing information directly 
                                from our Advertisers. You will need to check the 
                                “Opt-out” click boxes so indicated 
                                on the registration area for the particular event, 
                                or notify the Site’s Privacy Administrator 
                                via <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@wbbm-am.com">email</a>. 
                                You will also need to tell us if you do not wish 
                                to receive marketing or promotional materials 
                                from the Site and/or Station in the same manner.</p>

                             The use of cookies is an industry standard and 
                                they are currently used on most websites, including 
                                this Site. Cookies are a small text file containing 
                                a unique identification number that is transferred 
                                from a website to the hard drive of a user’s 
                                computer so that the website administrator may 
                                identify the computer and passively track the 
                                user’s activities on the website. Image 
                                tags work in conjunction with cookies and are 
                                small image files that may be located on select 
                                pages of our Site, or with-in web-based email 
                                newsletters that we may send. (Image tags are 
                                also called web beacons, web bugs, clear GIFs 
                                or single-pixel GIFs.) Tracking is important because 
                                we can better understand what parts of our website 
                                are used the most, when to launch new services 
                                and how to enhance current offerings. We may share 
                                the information we receive from cookies and image 
                                tags with third-parties and our Advertisers in
