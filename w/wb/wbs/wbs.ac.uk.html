		<ul>
			<li>where you have given your consent
				<div class="microcopy">where we ask or notify you first</div></li>
			<li>to protect someone's safety, or for legal reasons

		</ul>
	</div>

    <h2 class="breathe" id="introduction">An introduction</h2>
	  
	  
		  <p>This statement of policy practices applies to all providers 
			and users of network products and services offered by Warwick Business 
			School (WBS) on the sites:</p>
		  <ul>
			<li>www.wbs.ac.uk</li>
			<li>my.wbs.ac.uk</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>and such other domain names that reference these same servers.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>group.wbs.ac.uk</li>
				<li>www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/wbs</li>
			</ul>
		  <p>All authors of pages on group sites are encouraged to follow this privacy policy.
			However WBS does not endorse or monitor their content,
			and therefore any divergence from this policy will not be the responsibility of WBS.
			To clarify the privacy practice of authors on group sites, you should contact
			the individual page author directly.</p>
		  <p>WBS agrees to adhere to this privacy policy and to <a href="#changes">make it clear</a>

      <h2 id="scope">The scope of this privacy policy</h2>
      
        <p>WBS websites may contain links to other sites and may allow other 
        sites to be linked with the WBS name. These other sites may also collect 
        personally identifiable information about you.</p>
      <p>While we shall endeavour to ensure that privacy policies 
        at these sites match that at WBS, we cannot guarantee that they do so. 
        Consequently, this privacy statement does not cover third party data collection 
        practices and WBS cannot take responsibility for the practices of third 
        parties.</p>
      <p>If you feel that a site associated with a WBS site or 
        using the WBS brand and/or logo does not follow an acceptable privacy 
        policy, please

      <h2 id="information">The information WBS collects</h2>
        <p>We aim to provide information about WBS and our services to prospective 
        customers. In order to tailor our services to the market and individual 
        users, we may need to collect information from the many individual visitors 
        to our site. The following kinds of information are collected:</p>
		<div class="clearfix">
			<div class="grid_3 alpha">
		      <h3>Involuntary - anonymous</h3>
		        <p>Information that can not be tied back to a specific individual. 
		          Collecting this information allows us to analyse the use of our website,
			and compare with others, so that we can improve it.</p>
		        <p>Examples of <em>involuntary - anonymous</em> information include:</p>
		      <ul>
		        <li>The visitor's IP address
					<div class="microcopy">which we can use to tell us a visitor's country/region of location,
				whether that computer has visited before, and
					what type of connection they have, eg. academic institution, or government</div></li>
		        <li>Referral data <div class="microcopy">the page from which a visitor comes, if by clicking on another site's link</div></li>
		        <li>Browser and platform type <div class="microcopy">eg. whether Firefox, Chrome or IE; what version; whether Macintosh, PC, or smartphone</div></li>
		        <li>Search terms used to arrive at a page.</li>
		       </ul>
			</div>
			
			<div class="grid_6 omega">
		        <h3>Voluntary - personally identifiable</h3>
		 			<p>Information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name 
					and postal address. Wherever and whenever WBS collects personal information 
					through registration, we stress the voluntary nature of the transaction 
					and include a link to this privacy statement.</p>
					<p>WBS might collect <em>voluntary - personally identifiable</em> 
					information that has been provided in several ways, including when 
					you:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Register for a product or service</li>
					<li>Request further information or documentation. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>You might choose to register for a product or service 
					on one of the WBS websites. If you do, you will be asked to provide personal 
					details and contact information. While not all of this information is 
					required, the more information you give and the more accurate it is, the 
					better we are able to target our services to different categories of users 
					and improve the usefulness of our site. Once registered you may be given 
					a WBS Personal ID and be able to take fuller advantage of product and 
					service offerings on the website, including personalisation services.</p>
					<p>You might be asked for personal information and contact 
					details at other times, such as when you request further information or 
					mail-outs of brochures. We will also ask for information when you make 
					a purchase or use a credit card to pay for any service advertised and 
					offered on a WBS website.</p>
					<p>We will not collect your email address for re-use if you choose to 
					contact us. However, we might keep a record of that correspondence. Any 
					information provided is used solely to respond to the email, or to follow 
					up with directly requested or subsequently available related information.</p>
					<p>If you do choose to register on the WBS websites but 
					not to provide some elements of the requested information, we shall endeavour 
					to satisfy the requested transaction. We may, however, not be able to 
					do so or to offer a personalised service that depends on this information.</p>

      <h2 id="cookies">How WBS uses cookies</h2>

		<p>Like many websites, we use <dfn>cookie</dfn> technology to collect additional website usage data
		and to improve our services. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk.
		We do not require cookies for many parts of our services such as simple browsing of information.
		However, we may require cookies for transactional, personalised, or password-protected areas.
		We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our websites,
		and to monitor aggregate usage by our visitors. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies.
		You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before
		accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. You can find instructions for many browsers
		<a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=2">here</a>.
		If you set your browser to refuse cookies, please be aware that there may be functionality
		that does not work.</p>

      <h2 id="organisations">The organisations using the information collected</h2>
      <p>Information that is collected during registration
		may be managed within WBS or the University of Warwick. We may pass information
		to other organisations in order for them to provide contracted services to WBS.
		These organisations are also bound by this privacy policy.</p>
      <p>WBS may form relationships with other services and 
        content providers. These services may also require registration to make 
        them function properly. You will recognise these sites by 'joint branding', 
        identified by the relevant organisational logos. Other third-party relationships 
        may be 'private label' relationships where a product or service partner 
        provides WBS with technology, services and/or content under WBS branding.</p>
      <p>Whenever you provide registration information on joint 
        branded or private label sites, that data may be shared with the partners. 
        You should make every effort to read the individual privacy policies of 
        the partners, and make an informed decision on your own whether or not 
        to continue based upon these sites' privacy practices and your own discretion. 
        You may opt-out of sharing your information with such partners by choosing 
        not to use that service or content.</p>

      <h2 id="wbs">How WBS uses the information collected</h2>
        <p>Any information that we collect will be accessible only to those responsible 
        for the running of the websites and the operation of associated services, 
        unless specifically stated otherwise.</p>
      <p>WBS may use the information obtained in several ways, 
        including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Informing content providers about the number of people 
          with different demographic characteristics who have visited the site 
          and seen or visited their content area</li>
        <li>Performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics 
          and behaviour of our customers and visitors</li>
        <li>Measuring user demographics and interests regarding 
          specific areas of the website so that analyse how best to use our resources 
          to improve the site</li>
        <li>Contacting you about new or enhanced products and services 
          that might be of interest to you</li>
        <li>Preparing forms so that they will be easier for you 
          to complete</li>
        <li>Providing information about individual users to appropriate 
          governmental authorities, where required by law.</li>

      <h2 id="access">How to access, edit or delete your personal information</h2>
        <p>Please <a href="/feedback/?type=privacy">contact us</a> if you would like to access, 
        edit or delete the personal information in your user profile. To delete cookies,
        please read your web browser help information.</p>

      <h2 id="opt-out">The opt-out policy for WBS websites</h2>
        <p>The WBS websites offer you the ability to opt out of receiving information 
        on WBS site updates and new services. This is done at the point of initial 
        collection of information and during the editing or updating process.</p>
        
      
			<div class="backto"><a href="#top"><img src="/common/graphics/icon_back-to-top.gif" width="16" height="13" alt="Back to">top</a></div>
		
      
      <h2 id="security">The procedures in place to protect your information</h2>
        <p>WBS has security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, 
        misuse and alteration of your user data under our control. Only authorised 
        employees have access to the information you provide us and there are 
        strict rules on WBS employees who have access either to the databases 
        that store user information or to the servers that host our services.</p>
        
      <p>We cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to 
        data will not occur. However, we make every effort to prevent such occurrences. 
        We use a secure web server, which features encryption and secure transmission 
        by way of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to collect particularly sensitive 
        information. Since data may pass through many computers across 
        the Internet on its way to WBS, we cannot vouch for the security of any 
        information sent through insecure connections.</p>
      <p>You are ultimately responsible for the security of any 
        WBS Personal ID and password you may be given. Please take care when using 
        and storing them. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to 
        anyone. You should also exit/quit from your browser at the end of each 
        computer session to ensure that others cannot access your personal information 
        and correspondence, especially if you share a computer with someone else 
        or are using a computer in a public place, like a library or Internet 
        café.</p>
     <p>When you communicate with others online, you should be 
        aware that, when disclosing personal information on a web page, in a newsgroup, 
        chat room or forum, that information may be collected and used by others 
        to send that person unsolicited email from other parties outside of WBS. 
        Some of the email you receive may be useful to you, but some may not. 
        To curtail unsolicited email, WBS may block certain email addresses and 
        domains from sending email to email addresses at our domains.</p>
