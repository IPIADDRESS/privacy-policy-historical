<p>
This Privacy Policy describes the types of information collected from you, what we do with it, and with whom we share it for this website <strong>www.whdh.com</strong> (Site). This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by or through the Site. It does not apply to information obtained by other means.  Your privacy is important to us.  It is your responsibility to carefully review this Privacy Policy before providing any information through this Site, especially personal information.  If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or Site, or if you wish to unsubscribe from Site services for which you have previously registered, please contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@whdh.com">webmaster@whdh.com</a> or write to us at WHDH-TV, 7 Bulfinch Place, Boston, MA 02215, ATT: WHDH.com webmaster.
</p>

Please review this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use for the websites carefully.  Your use of our sites signifies your agreement to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
Personal Data is any information that can be used to identify a specific individual, such as your name, email address, home address or phone number.  We collect Personal Data whenever you visit the Site to, for example, register for certain services on-line; agree to participate in on-line surveys; request certain on-line information from us; participate in chat rooms, blogs or other user forums; or participate in on-line contests and promotions sponsored by us. We also collect such information when you register for wireless services via your mobile phone or other wireless devices.  Because participation in these activities is completely voluntary, the user has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The type of information requested or collected by us includes user contact information (such as name and email address) and user demographic information (like gender or age).
</p>

<p>
Aggregate and anonymous data is information that does not identify you specifically including data collected automatically through operation of the Site (AA Data). Like many sites, the Site makes use of browser "cookies" or other similar technologies to collect AA Data. Cookies are files written to a user's hard disk and read by the server programs to inform a website if the user has previously visited that site. We use cookies to improve your user experience by delivering content specific to your interests, saving your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our sites, tracking progress and number of entries in activities that require registration or entry, such as sweepstakes and for other purposes. You can set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when cookies are being used, but it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function properly if you do so.
</p>

<h2>Our Use of Your Information</h2>

<p>
We will use your Personal Data for the purposes for which it was provided.  For example, if you provided Personal Data to enter a contest or sweepstakes, we will use it to register you and will use your contact information to notify contest winners and award prizes. We may also use your Personal Data to provide you with information about features, services and other offerings that may be of interest to you. Cookies and similar tools may be used to relate your use of the Site and AA Data to Personal Data obtained from you.  If any AA Data is linked with Personal Data, the linked AA Data will then be treated as Personal Data.
</p>
 
<p>
AA Data collected through surveys will be used for purposes of reporting survey results and monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. We may also use Personal Data in aggregate form for purposes of research or analysis.  In order to better understand and serve users of the Site, we often conduct research on customer demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Data we gather.  Although this aggregated data may be based in part on Personal Data, it does not identify you personally.  We may share this type of AA Data with a variety of third parties, including affiliates, agents and current and prospective business partners.
</p>

<p>
 We use AA Data collected from the Site for site administration, advertising and promotional purposes, and we may share such information with various third parties.  For example, IP addresses are used to administer the Site and to provide AA Data to advertisers about the volume of use on the Site. We track and record IP addresses that access our site for reporting and profiling purposes only. We also gather anonymous browsing habits of our visitors to better identify content preferences. Clickstream data and demographic AA Data may be shared with our advertisers and business partners.
</p>

<h2>Disclosure of Personal Data</h2>

<p>
We reserve the right to share Personal Data with our affiliates.  If you do not want us to share your Personal Data with our affiliates for their marketing purposes, you may opt-out of such sharing by contacting us at webmaster@whdh.com.
</p>

<p>
We sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions on our behalf, such as hosting specific portions of the Site, maintaining databases, administering contests, providing wireless services and mailing information.  When we hire a third party to perform these functions, that third party will only be provided with the Personal Data it needs to perform its function, and is required to afford the same level of protection to your Personal Data.  We may also share Personal Data with pre-screened third parties for their marketing or promotional purposes.  If you prefer that we not share your Personal Data in this way, you may opt-out of such sharing by contacting us at webmaster@whdh.com.  For third-party sponsored contests, sweepstakes or promotions, we may request Personal Data from you that may be shared with the sponsor.  
</p>

<h2>Disclosure Exceptions</h2>

<p>
We may disclose Personal Data without providing you with a choice under the following limited circumstances: a) to protect the legal rights, privacy or safety of WHDH, or its employees, agents and contractors; b) to protect the safety and security of visitors to our Site or other properties; c) to protect against fraud or other illegal activity or for risk management purposes; d) to respond to inquiries or requests from governmental authorities; e) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; f) to enforce our Terms of Use; or g) to comply with the law or legal process.
</p>

<p>
If WHDH or its affiliates make a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may, in our sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign your Personal Data to a third party as part of or in connection with that transaction.  Upon such transfer, the Privacy Policy of the acquiring entity will govern the further use of your Personal Data.
</p>

<h2>Third Party Advertising</h2>
The ads appearing on this Site are delivered to you by several third parties. These third parties' websites and advertisers, or the advertising companies that work on their behalf, may use technology to send (or "serve") ads directly to your browser. We may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess technology that allows the Site to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on the Site.  This data (including clickstream data about your activities on our Site) may be shared with these companies for this purpose.

<h2>Third Party Cookies</h2>
<p>
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, a third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser, or use Javascript, Pixel Tags and other technologies to deliver advertisements, to collect information about the effectiveness of their advertisements, and to collect anonymous information about your visits to the site (but not your name, address or other Personal Data).  While we use cookies in other parts of our website, cookies received with these ads are not being collected by us and we do not have access to this information.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, we suggest you visit www.networkadvertising.org.
</p>

In these cases you are no longer on www.whdh.com and are now on a different website whose information collection practices may differ from ours. These sites may send their own cookies to you and may collect data and make use of that data in ways that this Site would not. You should check the applicable privacy policy to determine how other sites will use the information collected from you.

Access to Personal Data is limited to a very small number of employees with a defined need and is password protected. 
</p>
