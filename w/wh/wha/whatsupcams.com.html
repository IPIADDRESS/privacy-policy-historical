                S3MEA d.o.o. understands that privacy is important. The purpose of this Policy
                is to govern our use of information we may learn about you when you visit our
                web site, our services or our video streaming embedded widgets, What's Up Cams

                our Policy, the Site is subject to the Terms of Use which governs in any
                conflict with this Policy. We may change this Policy at any time by notifying
                you of a new effective date.
            </p>

            <p>
                By using the WUC Service, you expressly consent to the information handling
                practices described in this notice. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into
                and is subject to the WUC Terms of Use. Your use of the WUC Service and any

            <h3>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT:</h3>
            <p>There are instances where WUC asks for personal information, such as name and
                email address, to authenticate users (WUC advanced member services only) and to
                send notifications to those users relating to WUC. We do this when you submit a
                inquiry form to WUC, sign up for WUC's advanced services, post an image to
                Facebook or Twitter or whenever you enter a WUC sweepstakes or other WUC
                promotions. The user's contact information is used to allow the user to utilize
                WUC features, contact the user when necessary and advise them about new
                services and/or products. The user's Facebook and Twitter account information
                will only be utilized to post an image or video to the user's account as
                requested by the user. If WUC intends to disclose personal information in some
                restricted situation, this is specifically explained to you when we collect the
                information in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions.
            </p>

            <p>WUC uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate,
                maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the
                WUC Service as well as to track user-generated content and Users to the extent
                necessary to comply as a service provider with the applicable laws. We may use
                your email address without further consent, for administrative communications
                such as notifying you of major WUC Service updates, for customer service
                purposes, and to send privacy or security related notices. WUC uses all of the
                information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of
                our Users, to improve the way the WUC Service works and looks, to create new
                features and functionality.
            </p>

            <p>
                “Automatically Collected“ Information: When you access the WUC Service
                (including through your computer or your mobile device) or open one of our HTML
                emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by
                using different types of tracking technology. This “automatically collected“
                information may include Internet Protocol address (»IP Address«), a unique user
                ID, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you
                access on the WUC service, and the dates and times that you visit the WUC
                Service. Unique identifiers are collected for use as account numbers in our
                record system. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We
                use this data to tailor the user's experience at our site and in displaying the
                content according to their preferences. WUC shares information about our users
                with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. We refer
                to our users as an entirety, not as individuals. For example, we will compare
                WUC's audience of females vs. males with the use of variables such as x and y.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Cookies:</strong> Our Site may place a »cookie« in the browser files of your computer.
                This cookie does not collect information that personally identifies you as an
                individual (other than your Internet protocol address), but merely allows us to
                recognize your repeated visits to our Site. We use our cookie collected
                information to make your visit to our Site more enjoyable and allow user access
                until you logout. If you want to disable cookies, there is a simple procedure
                in most Internet browsers that allows you to turn off or delete cookies, but
                please remember that cookies may be required to allow you to use certain
                features of our Site. WUC also uses cookies to keep track of your custom
                created WUC account and it's data. We use cookies to deliver content specific
                to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it
                each time you visit our site. WUC also automatically receives and records
                information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, WUC
                cookie information and the page you requested. We use your IP address to help
                identify you, generate our statistic logs and to count the traffic statistics
                for our site.
            </p>

            <p>
                “Pixel Tags“ or “Clear Gifs“ A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web
                beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our WUC Service but not
                on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic
                notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies,
                registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn
                off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Third Party Advertising:</strong> Ads appearing on this website may be delivered to
                users by WUC or one of our advertising partners
                (http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/). Our advertising partners may set
                cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time
                they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile
                information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their
                advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows
                an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of
                most interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by WUC
                and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

                <strong>Security:</strong> WUC advanced member accounts are secured by member-created passwords.
                WUC takes precautions to insure that advanced member account information is
                kept private. We use reasonable measures to protect member information that is
                stored within our database and we restrict access to member information to
                those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our
                customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that we cannot
                guarantee the security of advanced member account information. Unauthorized
                entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise
                the security of member information at any time.

            <p>
                <strong>Sharing and Disclosure of Information:</strong> Except as otherwise described in this
                privacy statement, WUC will not disclose personal information to any third
                party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal
                requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process
                received by WUC, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2)
                to enforce the WUC Terms of Use or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the
                safety of members of the public and users of the service. WUC reserves the
                right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires
                rights to that information as a result of the sale of WUC or substantially all
                of its assets to that successor in interest.
            </p>

            <h3>OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY:</h3>
            <p>
                WUC uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards
                to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot,
                however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to WUC,
                and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of
                information, WUC makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security
                of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such
                information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of
                any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
            </p>

            <p>
                If WUC learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you
                electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. WUC may post
                a notice on the WUC Service if a security breach occurs.
            </p>

            <h3>ADVERTISERS:</h3>
            <p>
                WUC allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to
                serve advertisements within the WUC Service. These third-party ad servers or ad
                networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, the
                advertisements that appear within the WUC Service and they automatically
                receive your IP Address and other log file information when this happens. Such
                third-party ad servers may also use other technologies (such as cookies,
                javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their
                advertisements and to personalize their advertising content.
            </p>

            <p>
                WUC does not provide your personally identifiable information to these
                third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please
                note that if an advertiser asks WUC to show an advertisement to a certain
                audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the
                advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the
                audience that they were trying to reach. You should consult the respective
                privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. This Privacy
                Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other
                advertisers or web sites. WUC reserves the right the add or remove third-party
                ad networks or ad servers in its discretion and WUC may not at all times list
                such updated ad network or ad server partners in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <h3>CHANGES AND UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY:</h3>

                and this will be reflected by the »last updated« date found at the top of this
                page. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. In general, we
                only use your personal information in the manner described in the Privacy
                Policy in effect when we received that personal information. Your continued use
                of the WUC Service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any
                future revisions.

                For revisions to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on
                our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will
                make reasonable efforts to notify you and obtain your consent before
                implementing revisions with respect to such information.
            </p>
