<h3>IP Addresses and Cookies.</h3>
  	<p>We may collect information about your computer including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. These are data about our users' browsing actions and patterns and do not identify any individual.</p>

<p>For the same reason we may obtain information about your general Internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more  personalised service.

  <li>to recognise you when you return to the Site.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser, which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the Site.

By submitting your personal data you agree to this transfer. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>

<h4>Risks Involved in Transmitting Personal Data Over the Internet</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure.
