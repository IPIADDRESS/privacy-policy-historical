 </script></span>.<br> <br> The present privacy policy governs the online information collection  practices of Whatiexpect.in ("we" or "us" or "Whatiexpect.in").  Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about  you from your use of the Whatiexpect.in website (the "Site"), and the  ways in which we use and don't use this information. This privacy  policy, including our children's privacy statement, does not apply to  any information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline  and/or through other means. To register for full access to the Site and  in certain areas of the Site (for example, on contest entry pages),  where personal information is requested, you may be asked for your age  or birth date. You hereby agree that all information you provide to  Whatiexpect.in regarding age verification shall be truthful, accurate,  and complete. <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">This privacy policy details important  information regarding the use and disclosure of user and/ or member  information collected on the Site. Whatiexpect.in provides this privacy  policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or  discontinue using the Site. <br> This privacy policy is incorporated into and is subject to the  Whatiexpect.in Terms of Use. Your use of the Whatiexpect.in Site and any  personal information you provide on the Site remains subject to the  terms of this privacy policy and our Terms of Use. <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Please note that any comment or other content  posted on the Site becomes published content and is not considered  personally identifiable information which is subject to this privacy  notice. <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Please read this privacy policy carefully. By  visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use of the Site, and  any dispute over privacy, is governed by this privacy policy and our  Terms of Use at the following link: <a href="http://whatiexpect.in/user-terms.html" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> . <br> <br> What information is collected about our users ?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> <br> The information that we collect about you while you are using the Site falls into the following general categories: <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">1. User provided information: We may collect and  store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply  either while on the Site or in responding via email in connection with a  feature provided on the Site. Some examples of this type of information  include demographic information that you electronically submit when you  sign up for access to certain features on the Site, information (such  as your name or email address) that you electronically submit when you  register for surveys or contests on the Site, information that you post  on message boards on the Site, and information contained in search  requests or questions that you submit to the Site. If you decline to  supply or provide us with certain information while using the Site, you  may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features  offered through the Site. <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">2. Cookies information: When you visit the  Whatiexpect.in Site, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file  containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that  uniquely identifies your browser. Whatiexpect.in uses both session  cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you  close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on  subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by  following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is  temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset  your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is  being sent. However, some features of the Whatiexpect.in Site may not  function properly. <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, third party advertisers or third  party ad servers that place and present advertising on the Site also may  collect information from you via cookies, web beacons, clear .gifs or  similar technologies. These third party advertisers and ad servers may  use the information they collect to help present their advertisements,  to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness, or for  other uses. The use and collection of your information by these third  party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the relevant third  party's privacy policy and is not covered by our privacy policy. Indeed,  the privacy policy of these third party advertisers and ad servers may  be different from our privacy policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">We allow third-party companies to serve ads  and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web  site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information  (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of  advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and  other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and  services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies  typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this  information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or  to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit  www.networkadvertising.org. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">3. Log file information: When you use the  Whatiexpect.in Site, our servers automatically record certain  information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website.  These server logs may include information such as your web request,  Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language,  referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain  names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the  amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your  request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your  browser. <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">4. Clear / transparent GIFs information: When  you use the Whatiexpect.in Site, we may employ "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web  Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users /  members anonymously. In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in  HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by  recipients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><br> If you would like more information about this practice and to know your  choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">click here</a> .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><br> How is this information used? <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">1. If you submit personally identifiable  information to us through the Whatiexpect.in Site, then we use your  personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the  features and functionality of the Whatiexpect.in Site. <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">2. We do not use your email address or other  personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing  messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or  feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We  may provide our advertisers with information about you and other  visitors that will enable our advertisers to better target ads to  specific types of visitors. We reserve the right to use and to disclose  to third parties all of the information that we collect online about you  and other visitors in any way and for any purpose, with one important  exception viz. We will not use the information that we collect online  from you while you are using the Site, nor will we authorize third  parties to use such information, to mail or email promotional offers  directly to you unless you have specifically informed us that you would  like to receive promotional offers from us and/or from third parties. If  you choose to receive these promotional offers, then your information  may be used for direct mail or email marketing. We may, however, use  your email address without further consent for non-marketing or  administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Whatiexpect.in  Site changes or for customer service purposes). <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">3. We use both your personally identifiable  information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as  anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type,  clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the  Whatiexpect.in Site and to create new features, promotions,  functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user /  member preferences and trends. <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">4. We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file  information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to  re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the  Whatiexpect.in Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and  information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns;  (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages  viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in  promotions, and contests. <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">5. The Site includes links to other websites and  provides access to products and services offered by third parties,  whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another  website or purchase third party products or services through the Site,  use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of  the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such  products or services. <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">6. We may also make some content, products and  services available through our Site through cooperative relationships  with third party providers, where the brands of our provider partner  appear on the Site in connection with such content, products and/or  services. We may share with our provider partner any information you  provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that  are made available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some  cases, the provider partner may collect information from you directly;  in which cases the privacy policy of the provider partner may apply to  the provider partner's use of your information. The privacy policy of  our provider partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions  regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you should  contact the provider partner directly for more information. Be aware  that we may occasionally release information about visitors / members  when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Terms of  Service agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of users  of the Site, the public, or the Whatiexpect.in Site. <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">7. Please also note that as our business grows,  we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that we sell  some or all of our assets, or our Site is acquired by another company,  information about our visitors may be among the transferred assets. <br> <br> When Whatiexpect.in discloses information <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">* We provide personally identifiable information  and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries,  affiliate companies, or other businesses or people for the purpose of  processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties  agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy  policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such  information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security  measures. <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">* We do share non-personally-identifiable  information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages  and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested  third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for  certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or  functionality on the Whatiexpect.in Site. <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">* We may release personally identifiable  information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required  to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is  necessary to comply with any law or to respond to a court order or an  order from any governing body or statutory authority. <br> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">* Whatiexpect.in also reserves the right to  disclose personally identifiable information and/or  non-personally-identifiable information that Whatiexpect.in believes, in  good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use,  take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself  against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government  enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web  site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of  Whatiexpect.in, our users / members or others. <br> <br> <br> <br> Special note to international users/ members <br> </span></p>
