<p align="center" class="wish2">WhatIfSports Statement of Privacy</p>

<p>The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the way we live, and we're starting to see that potential today. With only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy goods and services, and communicate with others from around the world--even people you might never have met.  It's important to
WhatIfSports.com to help its customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the Internet has to offer.</p>
<p><b><u>Privacy Principles</u></b></p>
<p>      Because your privacy is important to us, WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;will operate by the following six principles. Users should additionally consult the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section accompanying this Privacy Statement for more information regarding these principles.</p>
<p><b>Principle 1.</b> <br>    WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;will explicitly ask when they need information that personally identifies you or allows them to contact you ("Personal Information"). Generally this information is requested when registering for a site, when requesting a particular service, or when entering a sweepstakes or contest.
When possible, WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;will provide you with the means to make sure that your Personal Information is correct and current.</p>
<p><b>Principle 2.</b> <br>      WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;and their necessary service partners use your Personal Information to operate the sites and services and to inform you of new features,
services, and products from WhatIfSports.com and its affiliates.&nbsp;WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;may also carefully select other companies to send you information about their products or services which are related to the site's service but are not necessary to its operation (a "Secondary Use").</p>
<p><b>Principle 3.</b> <br>If&nbsp;WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;intends to use Personal 
      Information for a Secondary Use,&nbsp;WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;will provide you with instructions on how to decline this service.    You may also stop the delivery of informational or promotional mail from
WhatIfSports.com sites by following the instructions on the mail.</p>
<p><b>Principle 4.</b> <br>        WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;will not use Personal Information for a Secondary Use without obtaining the consent of a parent or guardian  when dealing with
children. When possible,&nbsp;WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;will provide e-mail notice to parents that children have provided Personal Information to the site.</p>
<p><b>Principle 5.</b> <br>           WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of
the law or comply with legal process served on WhatIfSports.com; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of WhatIfSports.com,
the site or the users of WhatIfSports.com, and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect
the personal  safety of users of WhatIfSports.com.</p>
<p><b>Principle 6.</b> <br>    If at any time you believe that&nbsp;WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;has not adhered to these principles, please notify
WhatIfSports.com by e-mail at <a href="mailto:webmaster@whatifsports.com?subject=Privacy Statement">webmaster@whatifsports.com</a>&nbsp;and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct the problem.</p>
<p>WhatIfSports.com is committed to maintaining its position as a premier site on the Internet.  As our site continues to develop, we may add new services and features to our website.  In the event that these additions affect our Privacy Statement, this document will be updated appropriately.</p>

<p><u><a name="FAQ1"></a>        </u></p>
<p><u>How will users know which privacy statement applies to their Personal Information?</u></p>
<p>                   Pages throughout WhatIfSports.com display a "Privacy Statement" link which identifies the privacy statement applying
to the site. Users may click on the link at any time to read the applicable privacy statement.</p>
<a href="#back">[Back]</a>
<p><u><a name="FAQ2"></a>    </u></p>
<p><u>How do WhatIfSports.com sites collect Personal Information?</u></p>
<p>Personal Information is collected by specifically requesting it from you. Generally this occurs when you register at a site, request a service, or enter an online contest or sweepstakes.</p>
<a href="#back">[Back]</a>
<p><u><a name="FAQ3"></a>What about "Cookies"?</u></p>
<p>           "Cookies" are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. "Cookies" can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences
on a particular site. The use of "Cookies" is an industry standard, and many major Web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers. "Cookies" in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a  user's computer. Most browsers are initially set to accept "Cookies". If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse "Cookies". However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a Web site if you do so. For example, the subscription
services of WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;may only be accessed if you accept "Cookies".</p>
<a href="#back">[Back]</a>
<p><u><a name="FAQ4"></a>How do WhatIfSports.com sites use Personal Information?</u></p>
<p>                          
              
           Usually, WhatIfSports.com sites and their necessary
service partners use your Personal Information to operate the site and to deliver their services. WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;may also use your Personal Information to inform you of other products or services available from  WhatIfSports.com and
its affiliates.&nbsp;WhatIfSports.com may&nbsp;also use Personal Information to allow other companies to contact you regarding products and services that may
be of interest to you (Secondary Uses).</p>
<a href="#back">[Back]</a>
<p><u><a name="FAQ5"></a>Does that mean WhatIfSports.com sites sell my Personal Information to other companies?</u></p>
<p>    No, WhatIfSports.com does  not sell customer
lists. However,&nbsp;WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;may partner with businesses to provide special services to our customers.  This type of use of Personal Information is called a "Secondary Use" because it is not necessary to the operation of the business or site.  For example, a site may offer discount coupons for services or related products.  In many cases these discounts would be an added benefit to our customers.</p>
<a href="#back">[Back]</a>
<p><u><a name="FAQ6"></a>What if I do not want my Personal Information shared with another company?</u></p>
<p>                      
                If WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;proposes to make a Secondary Use of your Personal Information you will be given an opportunity to instruct&nbsp;WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;not to allow such contact.</p>
<a href="#back">[Back]</a>
<p><u><a name="FAQ7"></a>What about companies that partner with WhatIfSports.com
sites to provide the site's products or services?</u></p>
<p>                                                           WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;may have several necessary
service partners who assist in providing the service or product associated with the site. As part of the operations  of the site,
these companies may have access to your Personal Information.  These companies may provide routine services, such as credit card processing, or may provide essential elements of the site.</p>
<a href="#back">[Back]</a>
<p><u><a name="FAQ8"></a>What about the Privacy of children?</u></p>
<p>           
               
            Safeguarding the Personal Information of children
is extremely important.&nbsp;WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;will also send follow up mail to the user's e-mail address instructing them to seek parental permission for their use of the site.   A child's Personal Information will be used for the operation of the service but it will not be used for "Secondary Uses" without a parent's permission.</p>
<a href="#back">[Back]</a>
<p><u><a name="FAQ9"></a>Do WhatIfSports.com sites collect other forms of information about its users?</u></p>
<p>     In addition to the use of Personal Information
to operate WhatIfSports.com,&nbsp;WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;may also gather anonymous information, which may be used by
WhatIfSports.com or shared with third parties. This is information which does not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. For example,
WhatIfSports.com might tell its advertisers how many users visited a particular advertisement, and for how long, so they can measure whether the advertisement was effective. This information is also used to generate advertising rates. Generally this information is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of "Cookies," "IP addresses," or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.</p>
<a href="#back">[Back]</a>
<p><u><a name="FAQ10"></a>How do I correct or change Personal Information that I have given to an
WhatIfSports.com site?</u></p>
<p>                                                     
  WhatIfSports.com&nbsp;allows&nbsp;you to review and update the Personal Information you
have submitted.</p>
<a href="#back">[Back]</a>
<p><u><a name="FAQ11"></a>Is my Personal Information secure from others using the
WhatIfSports.com site?</u></p>
<p>                       Personal Information collected by WhatIfSports.com sites is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public.</p>
<a href="#back">[Back]</a>
<p><u><a name="FAQ12"></a>How else might someone learn of my Personal Information while visiting an
WhatIfSports.com site?</u></p>
<p>      In addition to directly providing information to&nbsp;WhatIfSports.com, you might also provide Personal Information through&nbsp;e-mail exchanges or newsgroups made available to you on
WhatIfSports.com.  The Statement of Privacy does not cover this type of transfer of your Personal Information.  You should always be careful when distributing your Personal Information in this manner.  And remember that online chat sessions and newsgroup use is considered public and you are responsible for your actions in these areas.</p>
