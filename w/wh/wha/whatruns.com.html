Whenever you use our Site or WhatRuns Services, we strive to make sure that the Personal Information is correct. If that information is wrong, we give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your Personal Information, we may ask you to verify your identity before making any changes. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems). Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. Because we protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, even after information is deleted from the WhatRuns Services, it may not be immediately deleted from WhatRuns’s servers. To request removal of your Personal Information from our Site, Services, blog or social media, contact us at hello [at] whatruns.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p><p>If a User interacts with one of our Customers and the User seeks to access, or correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data or no longer wants to be contacted by one of our Customers, the User should direct its inquiry to the Customer because the Customer is the data controller. If the Customer requests WhatRuns to remove the Personal Information, we will respond to their request within 30 days.</p><p></p><h4>Disclaimer Google Analytics</h4><p></p><p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer to help the website analyse how visitors use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.

These measures include using SSL Certificates and two-factor authentication. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. No security measures are perfect and we cannot promise that the information about you will remain secure in all circumstances.</p><p></p><h3>Do Not Track Signal</h3><p></p><p>We treat the data of everyone who comes to our site in accordance with this Privacy Policy, whatever their Do Not Track setting.</p><p></p><h3>Children</h3><p></p><p>Our site is intended for a general audience and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13.</p><p></p><h3>How WhatRuns Collects Information?</h3><p></p><p>Cookies are small data files placed on your computer by the websites you visit and the emails you read and can be used to help recognize you when you return to a website, or when you visit other sites. We, or third party service providers, may use cookies to, among other things, measure activity, personalize your experience, remember your viewing preferences, or track your status or progress when accessing our site. For some of these purposes, our cookies may be tied to Personal Information and/or Potential PII. In particular, the WhatRuns Services use first-party cookies to maintain a coherent scope for a user session across multiple pages on a single website. These cookies do not track the same user across unrelated domains and, as described above, attempts to infer identity across domains is strictly prohibited.</p><p>Local Storage is a standard facility provided by HTML5-compliant browsers used to retain data on your computer across visits to the same website. We use local storage as a temporary holding area for user events that were observed locally but, due to the timing of a page unload, were unable to be transmitted as part of the user session. Return visits to the same website read and transmit events previously stored in local storage to complete previously recorded sessions.</p><p>This information may in the aggregate identify a User, however we will not identify a User as they browse the web if the User turns off cookies, as explained below.</p><p>WhatRuns does not and will not ever attempt to identify the same person across disparate, unrelated domains. It is a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy for our customers to attempt to build multi-site user profiles for the intent of selling or exchanging lists of users or demographic information.</p><p></p><h3>Opting Out</h3><p></p><p>If you wish to prevent all websites using the WhatRuns Services to be able to record an its activity, you can opt-out of the WhatRuns Services. Opting out will create a cookie that tells WhatRuns to turn off recording on any site which uses the WhatRuns Services. The presence of this cookie is required to continue opting out, so if you clear your browser cookies, you will have to opt-out again. (We regret that there isn't a better way to make your opt-out more permanent, but due to technical reasons, this really is the best we can do at present.)</p><p></p><h3>Blocking Cookies</h3><p></p><p>If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual or all of the cookies on your computer by following your browser’s help file directions. Note that turning off cookies may also disable functions of many websites you visit. If your browser is set to reject cookies or you manually delete cookies, WhatRuns will not be able to coalesce your anonymous user identity automatically into sessions across pages on the same website.</p><p></p><h3>EU Privacy Shield Framework</h3><p></p><p>WhatRuns complies with the EU Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the EU regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries. WhatRuns has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles will govern.</p><p></p><h3>Changes</h3><p></p><p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. When there are changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update this page. The date on the bottom will always indicate when we last made changes. If you are a visitor to this Site and disagree with the Privacy Policy, you should leave the Site and/or cancel your agreement with WhatRuns.</p><p></p><h3>What If I Have Questions or Concerns?</h3><p></p><p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy when using WhatRuns, please send us a detailed message to hello [at] whatruns.com</p></div></div></div></div><div class="bg-black footer padding-25"><div class="row"><div class="container"><div class="col-xs-12 mobile-text-center"><div class="col-sm-8 col-xs-12 mobile-padding-bottom-20"><img class="logo animate" src="https://www.whatruns.com/images/whatruns_logo_1.png" alt="whatruns"></div><div class="col-sm-2 col-xs-6 text-left mobile-text-center"><h5>COMPANY</h5><ul class="no-padding"><li><a href="https://www.whatruns.com/about">About</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/whatruns" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-sm-2 col-xs-6 text-left mobile-text-center"><h5>SUPPORT</h5><ul class="no-padding"><li><a href="mailto:hello@whatruns.com">Contact</a></li><li><a href="https://www.whatruns.com/terms">Terms</a></li><li><a href="https://www.whatruns.com/privacy">Privacy</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="col-xs-12 mobile-text-center"><div class="col-md-12 no-padding"><div class="col-md-6"><span>Copyright @ Whatruns.com 2017.
