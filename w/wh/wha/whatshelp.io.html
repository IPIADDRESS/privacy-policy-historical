                        <p>WhatsHelp LLC (“whatshelp”, “our”, “us” or “we”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you
                            of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal
                            information we receive from users of <a href="//whatshelp.io">http://whatshelp.io</a>
                            (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through
                            the Site. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any
                            material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult
                            this policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy,
                            terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our whatshelp Terms of
                            Service, accessible at <a href="/terms-of-service">http://whatshelp.io/terms-of-service/</a>.

                        </p>
                        <p>As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies
                            on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or
                            handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing,

                            within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.

                        </p>
                        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

                        <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, services,
                            features and content, to administer your use of the Site (together, the “Service”) and to
                            enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Service.

                        </p><h4><br>Personally Identifiable Information</h4>

                        <ol>
                            <li>In the course of using the Service, we may ask you to provide us with, or grant us
                                access to, or permission to obtain, certain personally identifiable information that can
                                be used to contact or identify you; personally identifiable information may include, but
                                is not limited to, your name, company name, email address, postal address, phone number,
                                profile photo, and credit card number and other billing information (“Personal
                                Information”).

                            </li>
                            <li>We collect Personal Information in connection with your registration to join our
                                Service. You can register to join via the Site or by logging into your account with
                                certain third party social networking sites (“SNS”) (including, but not limited, to
                                Facebook) via our Site. If you decide to register by logging into an SNS via our Site,
                                we will obtain the Personal Information you have provided to the SNS (such as your
                                “real” name, profile picture, email address and other information you make publicly
                                available via the applicable SNS) from the account you have with such SNS and use that
                                information to create your Account and you will become a Member; the information we
                                obtain may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS.
                            </li>
                            <li>We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and
                                personalization of your Account (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) history
                                of purchases you make via the Site and individual preferences) (“Non-Identifying
                                Information”).

                            </li>
                            <li>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your
                                Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions,
                                and administer your inquiries.

                            </li>
                            <li>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal
                                Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip
                                code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same
                                pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken
                                alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing
                                preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information
                                and aggregate it with information collected from other whatshelp Users (defined below)
                                to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of
                                the Service and to analyze and understand how our Site and Service are used. We may also
                                use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for
                                instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.

                            </li>
                            <li>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with whatshelp newsletters,
                                marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.
                                If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from
                                us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.
                                (See “Changing or Deleting Information,” below.)

                        <h4><br>Log Data</h4>

                        <p>When you visit the Site, whether as a Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of
                            these, a “whatshelp User”), our servers automatically record information that your browser
                            sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such
                            as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were
                            visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on
                            those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other
                            statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service
                            and for the Site’s technical administration, to increase our Site’s functionality and
                            user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs We also use this
                            information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their
                            requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with
                            other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information
                            for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.

                        </p>
                        <h2>Cookies</h2>

                        <p>Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file
                            that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies
                            for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information and
                            preferences for future logins to the Site. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable
                            certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to
                            monitor aggregate usage by whatshelp Users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike
                            persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the
                            Site and Service and then close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its
                            options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the
                            websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all
                            portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service.

                        </p>
                        <h2>Web Beacons</h2>

                        <p>We also use “web beacons”, “pixel tags”, “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or
                            collectively “Web Beacons”) on our Site. A Web Beacon is an electronic image, often a single
                            pixel, embedded on web pages. Web Beacons are ordinarily not visible to users. Web Beacons
                            allow us to count the number of users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver
                            branded services and to generate statistics about how our Site is used.

                        </p>
                        <h2>Phishing</h2>

                        <p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to
                            whatshelp. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top
                            priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your
                            login information, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail
                            or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade
                            Commission’s website.

                        </p>
                        <h2>Information Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h2>

                        <h4>Your logo on the Site</h4>

                        <p>Subject to your approval, we may also feature your company logo, company name and testimonial
                            on the homepage or any other pages of the Site.

                        </p><h4><br>SNS</h4>

                        <p>As a Member, you may link your Account with certain SNSs where you have an existing account
                            with the SNSs. In these instances, with your permission and on your behalf, we will share
                            your Account information with the applicable SNS. Through use of such SNSs’ APIs, as stated
                            above, we also receive certain information (which may include your Personal Information) in
                            accordance with the privacy settings you have set in your SNS account, if any. Other than
                            what we may share with the SNS in connection with your linking of accounts, the Personal
                            Information an SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent of our Service. Other
                            services, including the SNSs, follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the
                            Personal Information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or
                            statements of the other services you use.

                        </p><h4><br>Aggregate Information &amp; Non-Identifying Information</h4>

                        <p>We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may
                            otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry
                            analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in
                            these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.

                        </p><h4><br>Service Providers</h4>

                        <p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the
                            Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation,
                            maintenance services, database management, payment processing, product production, shipment
                            services, web analytics and improvement of the Site’s features) or to assist us in analyzing
                            how our Site and Service are used. These third parties have access to your Personal
                            Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or
                            use it for any other purpose.

                        </p><h4><br>Compliance with Laws &amp; Law Enforcement</h4>

                            that we delete your Personal Information from our database. We will use commercially

                        <h2>Security</h2>

                        <p>whatshelp is very concerned with safeguarding your information. The security of your personal
                            information is important to us. But remember that no method of transmission over the
                            Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. When you enter sensitive
                            information (such as credit card number or social security number) on our registration or
                            order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). In some
                            cases, we also encrypt sensitive information where it is stored on our systems. We will make
                            any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or
                            integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in
                            applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous
                            posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay,
                            insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures
                            necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the
                            data system.

                        </p>
                        <h2>International Transfer</h2>

                        <p>Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of
                            your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may
                            not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United
                            States and choose to provide information to us, whatshelp transfers Personal Information to
                            the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by
                            your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

                        <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

                            will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website is not an
                            endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor
                            is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do
                            not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own
                            cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from
                            you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal
                            information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements
                            of the other websites you visit.
