By obtaining this information, we can provide our Users with specific content that we&nbsp;think they might be interested in, according to their preferences and interests. The User may include only the&nbsp;information he or she feels comfortable including. However, the omission of certain information may limit the&nbsp;value of the experience for the User.

Aggregate or personally identifiable information collected&nbsp;about you on these sites may be shared by Whole Mom with that Partner. A Partner will not rent, sell, or disclose&nbsp;any of your personally identifiable information to third parties unless you consent to its doing so, for example, by&nbsp;opting-in while on a particular site to receive information or offers from a Partner’s affiliates, partners, or other&nbsp;third parties.</p><p><strong>Third Party Links and Member Websites&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You acknowledge that we do not monitor, control or endorse the information collection or privacy practices of any&nbsp;third parties, any co-branded or other affiliated sites which may or may not be owned or operated by or in&nbsp;conjunction with Whole Mom, or any credit card order processors, product shippers or other third parties who&nbsp;provide services throughout the Site.
