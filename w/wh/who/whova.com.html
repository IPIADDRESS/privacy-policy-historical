        <h3>Whova Privacy Policy</h3>
        <div>
          Whova Inc provides Services through whova.com web pages and
          Whova apps to you subject to this Privacy Policy, its Terms
          of Use, and its other policies. Whova may change this
          Privacy Policy at any time. By continuing to access or use
          whova Services, you accept any changes or revisions to this
          Privacy Policy.

        <h4>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, DO NOT USE WHOVA</h4>
        <h4>1. Information Available in Whova Services</h4>
        <div>
Whova aggregates publicly available information from company web
pages, university web pages, news pages, public social network
profiles, publication databases, patent databases, and other public
sources (“Public Information”).  This Public Information is available
to public directly from those sources (even without Whova). Whova does
not verify and cannot guarantee the accuracy of this Public
Information. For certain social network websites, Whova will only get
and show information if users provided corresponding login
credentials. It is user's responsibility to validate and revise his
own profile information in the Whova app.
        </div>

        <h4>2. Remove your information from Whova Services</h4>

instead of others), we remove your information from Whova Service. 
Note that since Whova collects information from Internet, having 
information removed from Whova Service does not mean that it is 
removed from its original data sources. In the Whova app, user can also 
validate and revise his own profile.

use services and technologies provided by other companies

about how you use Whova Services may be available to 
these other companies such as Google to the extent that 
their technology collects such information for Whova’s

Public Information about people under the age of 18. 
Whova’s email search may return Public Information about

sites and websites that permit children who are 13 years and 
older to create public profiles.

        <h4>6. Security</h4>
        <div>
We have tried our best in removing any possible security holes in our
released browser extensions and apps, but since it is hard to 100% 
verify software, we cannot provide 100% guarantee that Whova 
Services has zero security vulnerability. Whova is not responsible for 
any security issues caused by Whova Services.
