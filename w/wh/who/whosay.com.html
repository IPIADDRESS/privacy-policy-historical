		<p>Thank you for visiting this WhoSay website which is provided by WhoSay Inc. ("us," "we" or "our") and using the related applications (together, the "Site"). Your privacy is important to us. To help you understand our privacy practices, we provide this notice explaining how we collect, use, and disclose information from or about you when you are on the Site. By visiting the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
		<p class="title">What Information We May Collect</p>
		<p>In connection with your use of the Site, we collect and store any information you enter on our Site or give us in any other way. This information includes different types of personally identifiable information including but not limited to your name, address, gender, e-mail address, SMS number, telephone number, fax number, and credit or debit card information.

		<p>We may also collect certain information automatically when you visit or use our Site, such as the type of browser and operating system you are using, your IP address, Internet service provider, platform type, referring and exit websites, your use and navigation of the Site, and other clickstream data. When you use a WhoSay application on your mobile device, we may also collect information about your mobile's unique device identifier as well as other technical information about your device in order to serve content to it.  We will also link your device to your location if you have enabled location services on your mobile device.  This enables us to provide you with location-based services that you request, but you can switch off location-enabled features at any time through your mobile device.  Each time we request your location, your mobile device operation system manufacturer may also collect information about your location to provide and improve its location services. However, the location information we collect is not used by us to identify or contact you.</p>
		<p>If you choose to connect a Facebook, Twitter or other third party social networking account with WhoSay, we may combine the information we collect directly from and about you with information that Facebook, Twitter or your other social networking provider lawfully shares with us. The information they provide to us may include your social networking user ID, any information you have shared publicly through that social networking service, and any other information which they are lawfully permitted to share with us.  We use this information only for the purpose of enhancing the service we provide to you (for example, by allowing you to log into WhoSay using your social networking account credentials) and enabling you to share your WhoSay experiences through your connected social networking account(s).</p>
		<p>If you provide information about another individual, you confirm that you have informed them of our identity and the purposes for which their personal data will be processed as set out in this Privacy Policy and that you have obtained their consent to such processing.</p>

		<p>In particular, we may use information collected about your use of the Site through cookies and other technologies, to assist us in delivering to you relevant advertising when you visit the Site and other third party sites. To do this, we may work with third party advertising networks and advertisers to deliver these ads to you.  As noted below, these third party advertising networks and advertisers may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect and track your online behavioural information (such as demographic information, aggregated information, and Internet browsing activity) to assist them in delivering advertising that is more relevant to your interests.  This information does not enable us or them to identify your actual identity however.</p>
		<p>If you choose to submit content, including a comment, to the Site, we may publish your name, screen name and other information you have provided to us. Please note that any information you post or disclose through the Site's interactive features may be available to Site visitors and to the general public.

		<p>All of our communications will provide you with a method to unsubscribe, and you can also change your communications preferences by visiting your account settings. You may also exercise your right to opt out of the use of your information for marketing purposes<a name="cookies">&nbsp;</a>at any time by contacting us using the method explained under the section entitled <strong>Privacy Complaints or Queries</strong>.</p>
		<p class="title">Cookies and other Technologies</p>
		<p>To enhance your online experience, we use cookies. Cookies are text files we or our service providers place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering in connection with the Site. However, once you choose to furnish the Site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.</p>
		<p>Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser time, time spent on the Site, and pages visited. We use the information to understand Internet usage and to improve our content, offerings and advertisements. We may also use cookies to personalize your experience at the Site (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), save your password in password-protected areas, enable you to use shopping carts, as well as to offer you products, programs or services.</p>
		<p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, WhoSay Inc.) are called "first party cookies."  Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies".  Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, videos and analytics).  The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the Site and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
		<p>Cookies can remain on your computer for different periods of time.  Some cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they exist only while your website browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser.  Other cookies are "permanent cookies," meaning that they survive after your browser is closed and can be used by websites to recognize your computer when you later re-open your browser and browse the internet again.</p>

In order to adjust your browser settings or preferences, review the "Help" or "Internet Options" menu in your browser's tool bar.</p>
		<p>We may also use small pieces of code such as "web beacons," "pixel tags," or "clear GIFS" in connection with some Site pages and email messages to, among other things, track the actions of Site users and email recipients, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates. Web beacons are electronic files that count users who access a website or page and can also be used to see if a cookie has been activated. You can't decline web beacons; however, by preventing cookies being used on your computer you can prevent web beacons from tracking your activity.</p>
		<p>The use of the technologies described in this section allows our third-party vendors to deliver advertisements when you visit the Site or other websites or web properties across the Internet. These vendors may place pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs or similar technologies on the Site and third-party websites and also place or recognize third-party cookies when you visit the Site or other websites. These vendors may use information about your visits to the Site and other websites to serve advertisements about our products and services, and other companies' products and services, that may be of interest to you (and to measure the effectiveness of those campaigns).

		<p class="title">How we disclose the information</p>
		<p>We may share your personally identifiable information with the celebrity, influencer, artist, group or other WhoSay talent (each, a "Talent Account") to whose WhoSay Site you subscribe. Information provided by or collected from you that may be shared with a Talent Account includes your name, location, contact details (e-mail and SMS details), Facebook and/or Twitter login credentials (to enable account connection between your Facebook and/or Twitter accounts and the Site and its related services), correspondence, user-generated content, and website cookies and aggregated analytical reporting data generated by your use of the Site.</p>
		<p class="title">Recipients</p>
		<p>We do not otherwise share your personally identifiable information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your consent.</p>
		<p>We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage, management and analysis, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.</p>
		<p>We may use and share with third parties certain technical information (including IP addresses) or aggregated information to show general demographic and preference information and viewer patterns among Site viewers.</p>
