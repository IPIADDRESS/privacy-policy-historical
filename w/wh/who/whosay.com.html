<h2>Cookies and Other Technologies</h2>
<p>To enhance your online experience, we use cookies. Cookies are text files we or our service providers place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering in connection with the Service.

<p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, WhoSay Inc.) are called "first party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies".

The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the Site and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
<p>Cookies can remain on your computer for different periods of time. Some cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they exist only while your website browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser.

<p>You may set your Web browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block cookies altogether. In order to adjust your browser settings or preferences, review the "Help" or "Internet Options" menu in your browser's tool bar.</p>
<p>We may also use small pieces of code such as "web beacons," "pixel tags," or "clear GIFS" in connection with some Site pages and email messages to, among other things, track the actions of Site users and email recipients, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates. Web beacons are electronic files that count users who access a website or page and can also be used to see if a cookie has been activated. You can't decline web beacons; however, by preventing cookies being used on your computer you can prevent web beacons from tracking your activity.</p>
<p>The use of the technologies described in this section allows our third-party vendors to deliver advertisements when you visit the Site or other websites or web properties across the Internet. These vendors may place pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs or similar technologies on the Site and third-party websites and also place or recognize third-party cookies when you visit the Site or other websites. These vendors may use information about your visits to the Site and other websites to serve advertisements about our products and services, and other companies' products and services, that may be of interest to you (and to measure the effectiveness of those campaigns). If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, visit the Network Advertising Initiative at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>, the Digital Advertising Alliance at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info</a> or YourOnlineChoices at <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>.</p>
<p>By continuing to use the Service through your computer or mobile device, you consent to our use of cookies, pixels and local storage in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>How We Disclose the Information</h2>
<p>We may share your personally identifiable information with the celebrity, influencer, artist, group or other WhoSay talent (each, a "Talent Account") to whose WhoSay Site you subscribe.

<h2>Recipients</h2>
<p>We do not otherwise share your personally identifiable information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your consent.</p>
<p>We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage, management and analysis, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.</p>
<p>We may use and share with third parties certain technical information (including IP addresses) or aggregated information to show general demographic and preference information and viewer patterns among Site viewers.</p>
<p>We may use and disclose the information we collect from and about you as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (1) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (2) to comply with legal process; (3) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including those outside your country of residence; (4) to enforce our Terms of Use; (5) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (6) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property and/or that of our affiliates, you, or others; (7) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; and (8) to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities.</p>
<p>Please note that if WhoSay Inc. or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries or lines of business is sold or otherwise disposed of, including through merger of, consolidation or sale of assets, or in the unlikely event that WhoSay Inc. goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, the relevant customer database, including personally identifiable information we may possess about you, may, in whole or in part, be sold, disposed of, transferred or otherwise disclosed as part of that transaction and you acknowledge that the acquirer of WhoSay Inc. or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries or lines of business may continue to use your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy (as amended from time to time).</p>

<h2>Third Party Sites</h2>
<p>The Site may contain links to other websites whose information practices may be different than ours and for which we are not responsible. You should consult the other sites' privacy policies, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>

In addition, your information may be transferred to and maintained in whole or in part on computer networks which may be located outside of the state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction in which you reside, including the United States. You understand that the countries to which we may transfer information many not have as comprehensive data protection rules as in your country, and your use of the Service or your submission of any personal information to us will constitute your consent to the transfer of your personal information outside of the United States. However, please be assured that we take steps to ensure that your personal data is protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
