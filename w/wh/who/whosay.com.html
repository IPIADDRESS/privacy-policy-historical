		<p class="title">Cookies and other Technologies</p>
		<p>To enhance your online experience, we use cookies. Cookies are text files we or our service providers place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering in connection with the Site. However, once you choose to furnish the Site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.</p>
		<p>Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser time, time spent on the Site, and pages visited. We use the information to understand Internet usage and to improve our content, offerings and advertisements.

		<p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, WhoSay Inc.) are called "first party cookies."  Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies".

The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the Site and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>

Some cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they exist only while your website browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser.  Other cookies are "permanent cookies," meaning that they survive after your browser is closed and can be used by websites to recognize your computer when you later re-open your browser and browse the internet again.</p>
