                <strong>Your corporate/personal information</strong><br>
                In order to register a domain name at Whois.com you are required 
                to provide us with corporate/personal information by way of an 
                electronic online form. To register a domain name corporate/personal 
                information is required by the relevant registry of the TLD (top 
                level domain) for which you apply to register a domain name through 
                Whois.com. This information may include but not be limited to 
                company name, full name, mailing address, email address, contact 
                information for the account holder, registrant, billing, administrative,

                and credit card details provided by you through our Web site, 
                our Web servers support the use of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 
                Protocol where appropriate. Using this protocol your credit card 
                details are encrypted when transmitted to the bank.<br>

              <p><strong>Use of your information by third parties or as required

            Numbers, the international governing body for TLDs (Top Level 
            Domains) requires that registrars must make available the

            register a domain name to the public through the publicly accessible 
            database known as the Whois Database. This is a public policy 
            adopted by the domain name industry as a whole. </p>
