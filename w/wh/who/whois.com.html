              <h3 id="sharing-with-partners">Sharing with Partners</h3>

              <p>When we share personal information with certain third-party partners,
              including marketing and advertising partners, that information includes
              your name, email address and other information enabling partners to:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>assist you in using our products and services,</li>

                <li>contact you with offers, services or products that may be of interest
                to you, and</li>

                <li>provide you with their products or services.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>If you are located in a jurisdiction where such sharing requires your
              permission, we will only do so with your consent. Please note that if you
              access our services through a tool that hides your location, such as
              through a virtual private network, you may not receive our request for
              permission because we were not able to identify you as being located in a
              jurisdiction where your permission is required.</p>

              <p>Further, our partners are prohibited from using your contact information
              for any purpose beyond those set forth above without your consent. We will
              not provide our partners with your credit card information.</p>

              <h3 id="sharing-with-third-party">Sharing with Third Party Service
              Providers and Vendors</h3>

              <p>Occasionally, we enter into contracts with carefully selected third
              parties so that they can assist us in servicing you (for example, providing
              you with customer service, fraud detection and deterrence or access to
              advertising assets and providing us with information technology and storage
              services) or to assist us in our own marketing and advertising activities
              (including providing us with analytic information and search engine
              optimization services). Our contracts with such third
              parties prohibit them from using any of your personal information for any
              purpose beyond the purpose for which it was shared.</p>

              <p>We also share non-personal information with certain third parties,
              including the media, industry observers, marketing and advertising
              partners, vendors, customers, potential customers or partners. For example,
              we disclose mobile search trends, email open rates by industry, campaign
              best practices or the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked
              on, our websites or evaluated or purchased our products and services.</p>

              <h3 id="corporate-reorganizations">Corporate Reorganizations</h3>

              <p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, a sale of all or a
              substantial portion of our assets, or other similar sale transaction, your
              information will be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify
              you by email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any such transfer
              and any choices you may have regarding your information.</p>

              <h3 id="authorized-users">Authorized Users</h3>

              <p>All users authorized by you to have access to your account can view
              personal information stored in the account. A primary account holder can
              view personal information saved in subaccounts to which they have
              authorized access. We share information about authorized users only for
              legitimate purposes consistent with this privacy policy, including
              servicing your account and marketing products and services to you.</p>

              <h3 id="legal-reasons">Legal Process</h3>

              <p>Lastly, if legally required to do so, or if we have a good faith belief
              that such disclosure is reasonably necessary, we may disclose your personal
              information to courts of law, law enforcement authorities and other
              relevant third parties, such as internet service providers, to conduct an
              investigation, respond to a third party or law enforcement subpoena or
              court order, bring legal action, prevent harm to others or pursue other
              relief when you or a third party are or may be:</p>

                <li>violating federal, state, local, or other applicable law.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>This disclosure can include transferring your information to
              other outside the European Economic Area. To the extent we
              are legally permitted to do so, it is our policy to notify you in the event
              that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties
              in connection with a subpoena.</p>

              own risk. Once we have received your information, we will take appropriate
              technical and organizational measures to safeguard your personal
              information against loss, theft and unauthorized use, access or
              modification.</p>

              <p>When we collect financial account information, such as credit card
              numbers, we protect its transmission through the use of encryption such as

              agreements, you have rights in relation to the personal information we hold
              about you. We set out below an outline of those rights and how to exercise
              those rights. Please note that we will require you to verify your identity
              before responding to any requests to exercise your rights by providing
              details only known to the account holder. Please note that
              for each of the rights below we may have valid legal reasons to refuse your
              request, in such instances we will let you know if that is the case.</p>

              <h3 id="access">Access</h3>

              <p>You have the right to know whether we process personal information about
              you, and if we do, to access data we hold about you and certain information
              about how we use it and who we share it with.</p>

              <h3 id="portability">Portability</h3>

              <p>You have the right to receive a subset of the personal information you
              provide us if we process it on the legal bases of our contract with you or
              with your consent in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable
              format and a right to request that we transfer such personal information to
              another party. If you wish for us to transfer the personal information to
              another party, please ensure you detail that party and note that we can
              only do so where it is technically feasible. We are not responsible for the
              security of the personal information or its processing once received by the
              third party.</p>

              <h3 id="correction">Correction</h3>

              <p>You have the right to require us to correct any personal information
              held about you that is inaccurate and have incomplete data completed. Where
              you request correction, please explain in detail why you believe the
              personal information we hold about you to be inaccurate or incomplete so
              that we can assess whether a correction is required. Please note that while
              we assess whether the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate
              or incomplete, you may exercise your right to restrict our processing of
              the applicable data as described below.</p>

              <h3 id="erasure">Erasure</h3>

              <p>You may request that we erase the personal information we hold about you
              in the following circumstances:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>where you believe it is no longer necessary for us to hold the
                personal information;</li>

                <li>we are processing it on the basis of your consent and you wish to
                withdraw your consent;</li>

                <li>we are processing your data on the basis of our legitimate interest
                and you object to such processing;</li>

                <li>you no longer wish us to use your data to send you marketing; or</li>

                <li>you believe we are unlawfully processing your data.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Please provide as much detail as possible on your reasons for the
              request to assist us in determining whether you have a valid basis for
              erasure.</p>

              <h3 id="restriction-of-processing">Restriction of Processing to Storage
              Only</h3>

              <p>You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal
              information we hold about you other than for storage purposes in the
              following circumstances:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>You believe the personal information is not accurate for the period
                it takes for us to verify whether the data is accurate;</li>

                <li>We wish to erase the personal information as the processing we are
                doing is unlawful but you want us to simply restrict the use of that
                data;</li>

                <li>We no longer need the personal information for the purposes of the
                processing but you require us to retain the data for the establishment,
                exercise or defense of legal claims; or</li>

                <li>You have objected to us processing personal information we hold about
                you on the basis of our legitimate interest and you wish us to stop
                processing the personal information while we determine whether there is
                an overriding interest in us retaining such personal information.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 id="objection">Objection</h3>

              <p>You have the right to object to our processing of data about you and we
              will consider your request. Please provide us with detail as to your
              reasoning so that we can assess whether there is a compelling overriding
              interest in us continuing to process such data or we need to process it in
              relation to legal claims.</p>

              <p>You also have the right, at any time, to object to our processing of
              data about you in order to send you marketing, including where we build
              profiles for such purposes and we will stop processing the data for that
              purpose.</p>

              <h2 id="third-party-links">Third Party Links and Information Collection and
              Use by Our Users</h2>

              <p>Some of our Services provide links to other websites. Because we do not
              control the information policies or practices of these third party sites,
              you should review their privacy policies to learn about how they collect
              and use personal information.</p>

              <p>You may also log in to some of our Services using sign-in services such
              as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will
              authenticate your identity and provide you with the option to share certain
              personal information with us, such as your name and email address to
              pre-populate our sign up form. For example, if you take advantage of
              certain of our social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and
              widgets, such as the “Share This” button or interactive mini-programs that
              run on our site, the applicable social networking sites may collect your IP
              address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie
              to enable it to function properly.</p>

              <h2 id="children">Children</h2>

              <p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 18. We do not knowingly
              collect personal information from children under 18. If a parent or
              guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal
              information without such parent or guardian’s consent, he or she should
              contact us. If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with
              personal information, we will delete such information from our files.</p>

              <h2 id="data-transfer">Data Transfer</h2>

              <p>In order for us to provide the Services to you, your personal
              information will be transferred to, and stored at/processed in the United
              States. Your personal data is also processed by staff operating outside the
              European Economic Area (EEA), such as in India and the Philippines, who
              work for us or for one of our suppliers. We will take all steps reasonably
              necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in
              accordance with this policy.</p>

              <h2 id="notification-of-changes">Notification of Changes</h2>

              <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so
              please review it frequently. If we decide to change this privacy policy in
              any material way, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a
              notice on <a href="/">www.whois.com</a>
              prior to the change becoming effective. In all
              cases, your continued use of any Services constitutes acceptance to any
              such changes.</p>

              <h2 id="contact-us">Contact Us</h2>

              <p>If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about our Privacy
              Policy, our practices or our Services, you may contact us by email at
