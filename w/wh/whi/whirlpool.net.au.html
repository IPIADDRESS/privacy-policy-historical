The <b>only</b> 'stealth' data retained for each user is the date of last visit (to help weed out unused accounts), and your last IP (to investigate transparent proxy issues).<br><br><b>I am disappointed</b> about the level of immaturity shown by Josh Miles, with such presuppositions as <i>"the truth is that he is a snoop"</i>, and completely incorrect claims such as <i>"This along with allot (sic) of other features that are built into the database and search your computer when you login"</i>. This site does <b>not</b> currently log referrers, colour depth, times of access, or browser type against your username, and certainly does not "search your computer" in any way.<br><br><b>It was even claimed</b> that 'evidence' was discovered of this, saying <i>"To give your an example of what I have found out about Whirlpool..."</i>, as if it were actually true and not someone's creative imagination.<br><br><b>The replies shown below</b> indicate the public response to this issue, which has been cleared up, thanks to Dean Wilson who runs the great <a href="http://www.cableusers.com">Cableusers.com</a>.   </div>
