      <p>LAST REVISION: January 30, 2008</p>
      <p>This privacy policy applies to all of the products, services and Web 
      sites offered by WhitePages.com, Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated 
      companies (collectively, "Services"). It does not apply to information we 
      may receive from other sources such as directory listing information, 
      whether or not it is posted on the Web sites offered by us ("Sites"). This 
      policy does not apply to Sites or Services that do not link to this policy 
      or that have Service-specific policies. By using any of our Sites or 
      Services, you agree to the terms in this policy. If you have any questions 
      about this Policy, please feel free to contact us through our Web site or 
      write to us at Privacy, c/o WhitePages.com Inc., 1301 5th Ave, Seattle, 
      Washington 98101.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. <strong>Published Information on Sites: </strong>We obtain our 
        listing information from a broad variety of publicly available 
        information sources including public records and third party data 
        suppliers. Because this information is not collected on our Sites, it is 
        not governed by this policy. You may request that your published 
        information be removed from the Sites by following the online removal 
        process for the respective Site.<br><br>
        2. <strong>Types of Information 
        Covered by this Policy:</strong> Information that you provide when using 
        our Services which identifies you by full name, postal address, phone 
        number or email address, is referred to as "Personally Identifiable 
        Information." Information such as browser type, operating system, searches, Web 
        pages visited and information about a group or category of users is referred to as "General Information." <br>
        </p>
        <p>3. <strong>Information We Collect: </strong></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>. <u>Personally Identifiable Information</u>. You may provide 
          Personally Identifiable Information to us in various circumstances on 
          the Sites including registration based services, user panels and 
          surveys, and communications to us. For example, you may be required to 
          register to participate in certain services. During registration, we 
          may request information such as your name and email address, and other 
          information necessary to process payment for the service, such as a 
          credit card number, expiration date and billing address. &nbsp;We do 
          not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you on the 
          Sites unless you choose to provide it. This means that you can visit 
          most areas of our Sites without providing us any Personally 
          Identifiable Information. </p>
          <p>. <u>General Information</u>. </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>. <u>Server log information</u>. As you browse the Sites, our 
            servers collect information about your visit. Such information may 
            include your browser type, Internet Protocol (IP) address, the date 
            and time of your browsing sessions, which Web pages you viewed, 
            other communications with the Services and the IP address of the Web 
            page you visited immediately prior to visiting the Sites.</p>
            <p>. <u>Information collected by cookies, Web beacons and similar 
            technologies</u>. When you use the Sites, we may send your computer 
            a "cookie" to identify your Web browser. A cookie is a small file 
            that our servers send to your computer and which uniquely identifies 
            your browser. We may use cookies to track and compile your browsing 
            habits on the Sites, to keep you logged in to your Account (if 
            applicable) and to prevent you from having to enter the same 
            information repeatedly. We may also use "Web beacons," which are 
            small graphic files that may be included in or attached to an email 
            message or Web page, to track your browsing habits on the Sites and 
            to know whether you have opened an email from us. We use the 
            information we obtain from cookies and Web beacons for purposes such 
            as verifying whether you have an account with us, tracking your 
            visits to the Sites, customizing advertising content, and counting 
            the unique visitors to our Sites. Most browsers allow you to disable 
            cookies (i.e., not allow our servers to send cookies to your 
            browser); however, some of our services may not function properly if 
            you disable cookies.<br></p></blockquote></blockquote>
        <p>4. <strong>Information Other Companies and Advertisers 
        Collect:</strong> </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>. </em><u>Sites we do not own or operate</u>. The Sites may 
          contain or link to features and content on Web sites we do not own or 
          operate. Such Web sites may collect information about you, but we do 
          not have control over their collection practices. In particular, 
          please note that even if a third-party Web site indicates that it is 
          "powered by WhitePages.com," that does not mean that we have control 
          over the information collection practices of that Web site (or any Web 
          site other than the Sites). If you are visiting a third-party Web 
          site, please read its privacy policy to understand its policies 
          regarding information collection, usage and disclosure. </p>
          <p><em>. </em><u>Advertisers</u>. We may host (or contract with third 
          parties to host) advertising on the Sites. If you visit a Web site 
          depicted in an advertisement, any Personally Identifiable Information 
          you provide while on such site will be provided to the advertiser. The 
          advertiser's privacy policies and practices may differ from ours, so 
          you should check the advertiser's privacy policy before supplying 
          Personally Identifiable Information on the advertiser's site. 
          Third-party advertisers may also use cookies and Web beacons on the 
          Sites. These technologies allow the advertiser to recognize a cookie 
          in your browser when you visit the Sites. The information that these 
          advertisers collect through these technologies is not Personally 
          Identifiable Information. </p>
          <p><em>. </em><u>Advertising networks</u>. We may allow third-party 
          advertising companies and networks to serve cookies on the Sites and 
          to serve ads to you when you visit our Sites or other Web sites. These 
          companies and networks may use General Information about your visits 
          to the Sites and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements 
          about goods and services that they believe may be of interest to you. 
          If you would like more information about these practices and to 
          understand your choices regarding use of this information by these 
          companies, you may visit <a class="inlineArticles" title="Network Advertising Initiative" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_new">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>. 
          </p>
          <p><em>. </em><u>Site usage</u>. We may use third-party marketing 
          companies to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and 
          to analyze how visitors use the Sites. To do this, we may use cookies, 
          Web beacons and other technologies provided by these companies to 
          collect information. This information helps us learn things like the 
          pages that are most often viewed by our visitors and the kinds of 
          offers that our visitors most often select. Although these third-party 
          companies log the information coming from the Sites on our behalf, we 
          place restrictions on those third parties' use of such information. 
          You may learn how to "opt out" of our ability to analyze such data by 
          visiting <a class="inlineArticles" title="Omniture Opt Out" href="http://www.omniture.com/privacy/policy#optout" target="_new">http://www.omniture.com/privacy/policy#optout</a>. 
        </p></blockquote>
        <p>5. <strong>Information Use and Sharing:</strong> We use the 
        information we collect for the purpose for which it was provided. We may 
        use Personally Identifiable Information and General information in 
        combination with other information about you received from third-parties 
        in order to provide you with a better user experience, develop new 
        Services, improve the quality of our existing Services, and for internal 
        business purposes.</p>
        <p>We are not in the business of selling Personally Identifiable 
        Information. We may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information 
        for the following reasons: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>. Internal business purposes. </em>We may share personal 
          information with third parties to complete transactions you have 
          requested and to perform services on our behalf. When these third 
          parties perform services on our behalf, they are obligated to keep 
          such information confidential and to only use the information for the 
          purpose it was provided. <br></p>
          <p><em>. You authorize it. </em>We may disclose your personal 
          information if you authorize it. Sometimes, your authorization may be 
          implicit. For example, if you use our "Send Listing to Email" service, 
          your name and email address, along with any comments provided by you, 
          is sent to the recipient of the email. <br></p>
          <p><em>. To protect ourselves or others. </em>We disclose personal 
          information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law 
          (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply 
          this policy, or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, 
          bill and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users' 
          rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, 
          abusive or unlawful use of the Sites or any services; or if we 
          reasonably believe that an emergency situation requires or justifies 
          disclosure of communications or personal information without 
          delay.<br></p>
          <p><em>. Certain business transfers.</em> Information about you, 
          including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any 
          merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale of company assets, as well 
          as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which 
          personal information could be transferred to third parties as one of 
          our business assets.<br></p></blockquote>
        <p>6. <strong>Access to Your Personally Identifiable 
        Information:</strong> If you have registered for an Account, you may 
        access, review and update the Personally Identifiable Information you 
        provided during registration by logging into your Account with your 
        username and password.<br><br>7. <strong>Opting Out of Marketing 
        Communications: </strong>Regardless of how you have registered with us 
        and set up your Account, you can elect not to receive any marketing 
        messages from us. You may either follow the opt-out instructions 
        provided in an email message we send to you, or log in to your Account 
        and de-select the box indicating that you would like to receive those 
        communications. We honor opt-out requests within 10 business days. </p>
        <p>Please be advised that if you choose not to receive marketing 
        communications, you will continue to receive communications regarding 
        your transactions and Account with us (e.g., registration and purchase 
        confirmation emails, and information about your Account, if 
        applicable).</p>
        <p>8. <strong>Security of Your Personally Identifiable 
        Information:</strong> We use reasonable security measures to protect 
        your Personally Identifiable Information from unauthorized use and 
        disclosure while in our control. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 
        encryption to protect highly confidential Personally Identifiable 
        Information, such as credit card information, that is transmitted over 
        the Internet. Despite our best efforts, however, no security measures 
        are perfect, and we cannot guarantee that your information will be 
        secure from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.<br><br>9. 
        <strong>Children's Privacy:</strong> Our Sites and services are not 
        intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13. 
        WhitePages.com does not target the Sites or Services to, or knowingly 
        request, collect, use or share information from, children under the age 
        of 13. &nbsp;As a result of fraud, error or action by others, it is 
        possible that we may receive information given to us or pertaining to 
        children under the age of 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we 
        verify the information, we will promptly delete the information from our 
        servers. Questions regarding children's privacy should be directed to:

        <p>10. <strong>Changes to this Policy: </strong>We may change or update 
        this policy from time to time. Any changed or revised policy shall be 
        effective immediately after it is posted on the Sites. We will provide 
        notice of any material changes to this policy by posting a notice on our 
        Sites or by some other reasonable means.</p></blockquote>
