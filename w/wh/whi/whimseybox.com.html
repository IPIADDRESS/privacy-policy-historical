We also retain information that you post or store through your account and/or on our website, including without limitation, [reviews, recommendations, projects that you have worked on or would like to work on].  If you exchange any messages through our site, we may store those as well.  If you purchase anything through our site, we may collect your credit card or payment information. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us, such as a resume.

This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account, an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you made public in connection with that service.
