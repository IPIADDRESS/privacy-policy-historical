<p><strong>Updating Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>You may update or correct information you previously provided to IT Knowledge Hub LLC by accessing your user profile on our various directory web sites.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Web Sites </strong></p>
<p>ITKnowledgeHub.com, KnowledgeHubNetworks.com, MarketingKnowledgeHub.com, and WhitePaperWorld.com are three of the properties within the IT Knowledge Hub LLC network of sites. Each of these sites hosts thousands of white papers as well as white paper Research Libraries on third party sites. Some Third Party Content made available through the Research Library sites is maintained on the website of the Content Provider, and not on the IT Knowledge Hub LLC network of sites. This means that when you click through to that Third Party Content, you will be leaving the Research Library and the IT Knowledge Hub LLC Network. It will be clear to you when this happens, as the look and feel of your web page will change, and the URL will no longer refer to a website in IT Knowledge Hub LLC network of sites. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use and disclosure of any information you choose to disclose to the Content Provider on the Content Provider site.</p>
<p>In addition, the Sites you are viewing may be co-branded, meaning that the Sites are branded with the logos of both IT Knowledge Hub LLC and a third party (âCo-Branded Sitesâ). If you register or log in on a Co-Branded Site, you are choosing to disclose information to both IT Knowledge Hub LLC and the third party with whose brand the site is co-branded. This Privacy Policy only governs IT Knowledge Hub LLCâs use of your information. The third partyâs use of that personal information is governed by the partnerâs privacy policy, and not by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The IT Knowledge Hub LLC Web Site also contains links to other Web Sites. Please be aware that IT Knowledge Hub LLC is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of each and every Web Site that you visit from our Web Site or through the interactive sessions.</p>
