      shall designate one or more persons who are accountable for Intrawest's
      compliance with the following principles.<br>
      <br>
      
      <strong>1.1 </strong>Intrawest shall designate one or more persons to be
      accountable for compliance with the Policy. The Chief Privacy Officer is

      <br>
      <strong>1.2 </strong>Intrawest shall make known, upon request, the title

      the Policy.<br>
      <br>

      in its possession or under its control. Intrawest shall use appropriate
      means to protect personal information while information is being processed
      by a third party on behalf of Intrawest (see Principle 7).<br>
      <br>
      <strong>1.4 </strong>Intrawest shall implement policies and procedures

      <ul>
        c) training and communicating to staff about Intrawest's policies and

      <ul>
        d) developing public information to explain Intrawest's policies and
          practices.
      </ul>
      <strong><a name="#4">Principle 2 - Identifying Purposes for Collection
      of Personal Information</a></strong><br>
      <br>
      Intrawest shall identify and document the purposes for which personal information
      is collected at or before the time the personal information is collected
      or, when appropriate, at or before the time the personal information is
      used for a new purpose. <br>
      <br>
    
      <strong>2.1 </strong>Intrawest collects personal information for the following
      purposes: 
      <ul>
        a) to establish and maintain a responsible commercial relationship with
          customers;
      </ul>
      <ul>
        b) for purposes identified to individuals or purposes obvious to individuals,

      </ul>

        c) to meet legal and regulatory requirements;
      </ul>
      <ul>
        d) to understand needs and preferences of individuals;
      </ul>
      <ul>
        e) to develop, enhance, market and/or provide products and services;
      </ul>
      <ul>
        f) to manage and develop Intrawest's business and operations, including
          transfer of data among affiliated entities.
      </ul>
      <strong>Further references to "identified purposes" mean the purposes
      identified in this Principle.</strong><br>
      <br>
      <strong>2.2 </strong>Intrawest shall, as appropriate, specify orally, electronically
      or in writing the identified purposes to the individual at or before the
      time personal information is collected. Upon request, persons collecting
      personal information shall explain these identified purposes or refer the
      individual to a designated person within Intrawest who shall explain the
      purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <strong><a name="#5">Principle 3 - Consent</a></strong><br>
      <br>
      The knowledge and consent of an individual are generally required for the
      collection, use or disclosure of personal information. In certain circumstances
      personal information can be collected, used or disclosed without the knowledge
      and consent of the individual, such as in the case of an emergency where
      the life, health or security of an individual is threatened.<br>
      <br>
      Intrawest may disclose personal information without knowledge or consent
      to a lawyer or other advisor representing Intrawest, to collect a debt,
      to comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court order, or as may be otherwise
      required or authorized by law.<br>
      <br>

      <strong>3.1 </strong>In obtaining consent, Intrawest shall use reasonable
      efforts to ensure that an individual is advised of the identified purposes
      for which personal information will be used or disclosed. Purposes shall
      be stated in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the individual.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>3.2 </strong>Generally, Intrawest shall seek consent to use and
      disclose personal information at the same time it collects the information.
      However, Intrawest may seek consent to use and disclose personal information
      after it has been collected, but before it is used or disclosed for a new
      purpose.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>3.3 </strong>Intrawest will require individuals to consent to the
      collection, use or disclosure of personal information as a condition of
      the supply of a product or service only if such collection, use or disclosure
      is reasonably required to fulfill the identified purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>3.4 </strong>In determining the appropriate form of consent, Intrawest
      shall take into account the sensitivity of the personal information and
      the reasonable expectations of the individual.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>3.5 </strong>Where consent is required for a particular use or
      disclosure, an individual may withdraw consent at any time, subject to
      legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Individuals may
      contact Intrawest for more information regarding the implications of withdrawing
      consent.<br>
      <br>
      <strong><a name="#6">Principle 4 - Limiting Collection of Personal Information</a></strong><br>
      <br>
      Intrawest shall limit the collection of personal information to that which
      is necessary for the purposes identified by Intrawest and as permitted
      by law.
<br>
<br>

      <strong>4.1</strong> Intrawest collects personal information primarily
      from the individual to whom the information relates.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>4.2 </strong>Intrawest may also collect personal information from
      other sources including credit bureaus or other third parties who represent
      that they have the right to disclose the information, or as otherwise permitted
      by law. <br>
      <br>
      <strong><a name="#7">Principle 5 - Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention
      of Personal Information</a></strong><br>
      <br>
      Intrawest shall not use or disclose personal information for purposes other
      than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual
      or as required by law. Intrawest shall retain personal information only
      as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes or as required
      or permitted by law.
<br>
<br>

      <strong>5.1 </strong>Intrawest may disclose an individual's personal information
      to: 
      <ul>
        a) a person who in the reasonable judgment of Intrawest is seeking the
          information as an agent of the individual;
      </ul>
      <ul>
        b) a company or individual employed by Intrawest to perform functions
          on its behalf, such as but not limited to research or data processing;
      </ul>
      <ul>
        c) another company or individual for the development, enhancement, marketing
          or provision of any of Intrawest's products and services;
      </ul>
      <ul>
        d) an agent used by Intrawest to evaluate the individual's creditworthiness
          or to collect the individual's account;
      </ul>
      <ul>
        e) a credit reporting agency;
      </ul>
      <ul>
        f) a public authority or agent of a public authority, if in the reasonable
          judgment of Intrawest, it appears that there is imminent danger to
          life or property which could be avoided or minimized by disclosure
          of the information;
      </ul>
      <ul>
        g) another entity as part of a merger, a sale of assets or all or part
          of a business, or any other corporate change or re-organization;
      </ul>
      <ul>
        h) a third party or parties, where the individual consents to such disclosure
          or disclosure is required or permitted by law.
      </ul>
      <strong>5.2</strong> Only Intrawest employees with a business need to know,
      or whose duties reasonably so require, are granted access to personal information
      about individuals.<br>
      <br>
      <strong> 5.3 </strong>Depending on the circumstances, where personal information
      has been used to make a decision about an individual, Intrawest shall retain,
      for a reasonable period of time, either the actual information or the rationale
      for making the decision. <br>
      <br>
      <strong> 5.4 </strong>Intrawest shall maintain reasonable and systematic
      controls, schedules and practices for information and records retention
      and destruction which apply to personal information that is no longer necessary
      or relevant for the identified purposes or required or permitted by law
      to be retained. Such information shall be destroyed, erased or made anonymous.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>5.5 </strong>Where appropriate, Intrawest may communicate updates
      of personal information to third parties.<br>
      <br>
      <strong><a name="#8">Principle 6 - Accuracy</a></strong><br>
      <br>
      Intrawest shall take steps to ensure that personal information is as accurate,
      complete and up-to-date as is appropriate for its purposes.
  <br>
<br>

      <strong>6.1 </strong>Personal information used by Intrawest shall be sufficiently
      accurate, complete and up-to-date to minimize the possibility that inappropriate
      information may be used to make a decision about an individual.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>6.2 </strong>Intrawest shall update personal information about
      individuals as and when reasonably necessary to fulfill the identified
      purposes or as reasonably requested by the individual.<br>
      <br>
      <strong><a name="#9">Principle 7 - Security Safeguards</a></strong><br>
      <br>
      Intrawest shall protect personal information by security safeguards appropriate
      to the sensitivity of the information.
<br>
<br>

      <strong>7.1 </strong>Intrawest shall take appropriate and reasonable steps to protect
      personal information against such risks as loss or theft, unauthorized
      access, disclosure, copying, use, modification or destruction.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>7.2 </strong>Intrawest shall take appropriate and reasonable steps
      to protect personal information disclosed to third parties, for example
      by contractual agreements stipulating the confidentiality of the information
      and the purposes for which it is to be used.<br>
      <br>
      <strong><a name="#10">Principle 8 - Openness</a></strong><br>
      <br>
      Intrawest shall make readily available to individuals specific information
      about its policies and practices relating to the management of personal
      information.<br>
      <br>

      <strong>8.1 </strong>Copies of the Policy will be made available upon request.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>8.2 </strong>Intrawest shall make information about its policies
      and procedures easy to understand, including: 
      <ul>
        a) the title and addresses of the person or persons accountable for Intrawest's
          compliance with the Policy and to whom inquiries or complaints can
          be forwarded;
      </ul>
      <ul>
        b) the means of gaining access to personal information held by Intrawest;
          and
      </ul>
      <ul>
        c) a description of the type of personal information held by Intrawest,
          including a general account of its use.
      </ul>
      <strong><a name="#11">Principle 9 - Individual Access</a></strong><br>
      <br>
      Upon request, Intrawest shall inform an individual of the existence, use
      and disclosure of his or her personal information, at a minimal or no cost
      to the individual. An individual shall be able to challenge the accuracy
      and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate.<br>
      <br>

      <strong>9.1 </strong>In certain situations, Intrawest may not be able to provide
      access to all the personal information that it holds about an individual.
      For example, Intrawest may not provide access to information if doing so
      would likely reveal personal information about a third party or could reasonably
      be expected to threaten the life or security of an individual. Also, Intrawest
      may not provide access to information if disclosure would reveal confidential
      commercial information, if the information is protected by solicitor-client
      privilege, if the information was generated in the course of a formal dispute
      resolution process, or if the information was collected in relation to
      the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a law.
      If access to personal information cannot be provided, Intrawest shall,
      upon request, provide the reasons for denying access.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>9.2 </strong>In order to safeguard personal information, an individual
      may be required to provide sufficient identification information to permit
      Intrawest to authorize access to the individual's file. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>9.3 </strong>Individuals can seek access to their personal information
      by contacting a designated representative at Intrawest.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>9.4</strong> Intrawest will endeavor to respond to all requests
      within 30 days or, in any event, as required or permitted by applicable
      law.<br>
      <br>
      <strong><a name="#12">Principle 10 - Handling Inquiries and Challenges</a></strong><br>
      <br>
      An individual shall be able to address a challenge concerning compliance
      with the above principles to the designated person or persons accountable
      for Intrawest's compliance with the Policy.<br>
      <br>

      <strong>10.1 </strong>Intrawest shall maintain procedures for addressing
      and responding to all inquiries or complaints from individuals about Intrawest's
      handling of personal information.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>10.2 </strong>Intrawest shall inform its customers about the existence
      of these procedures as well as the availability of complaint procedures.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>10.3 </strong>The person or persons accountable for compliance
      with this Policy may seek external advice where appropriate before providing
      a final response to individual complaints. <br>
