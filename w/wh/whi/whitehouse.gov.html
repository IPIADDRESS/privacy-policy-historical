          <p>Thank you for visiting the White House Website and reviewing our 
            privacy policy. Our privacy policy is clear: We will collect <b> no</b> 
            personal information about you <b> </b>when you visit our website 
            unless you choose to provide that information to us.</p>
          <p>Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website: 
          </p>
          <h4><br>
            Information Collected and Stored Automatically</h4>
          <p>If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, 
            read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain 
            information about your visit automatically. This information does 
            <b>not</b> identify you personally. We automatically collect and store 
            <b>only</b> the following information about your visit:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if 
              you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" 
              if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP 
              address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer 
              whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website; 
            </li>
            <li> The type of browser and operating system used to access our site; 
            </li>
            <li> The date and time you access our site; </li>
            <li> The pages you visit; and </li>
            <li> If you linked to the White House website from another website, 
              the address of that website. </li>
          </ol>
          <p>We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors 
            -- to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types 
            of technology our visitors use. We do <b>not</b> track or record information 
            about individuals and their visits. </p>
          <h4><br>
            If You Send Us Personal Information</h4>
          <p>If you choose to provide us with personal information -- as in an 
            e-mail to the President, Vice President or someone else, or by filling 
            out a form with your personal information and submitting it to us 
            through our website -- we use that information to respond to your 
            message and to help us get you the information you have requested. 
            We treat emails the same way we treat letters sent to the White House. 
            We are required to maintain many documents under the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye.cgi?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/44/ch22.html">Presidential 
            Records Act</a> for historical purposes, but we do not collect personal 
            information for any purpose other than to respond to you. We only 
            share the information you give us with another government agency if 
            your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. 
            Moreover, we do not create individual profiles with the information 
            you provide or give it to any private organizations. The White 
            House does not collect information for commercial marketing. </p>
          <h4><br>
            Links to Other Sites </h4>
          <p>Our Website has links to many other federal agencies. In a few cases 
            we link to private organizations, with their permission. Before leaving 
            the White House website, a page will appear informing you that you 
            are leaving our server. Once you link to another site, you are subject 
            to the privacy policy of the new site. </p>
          <h4><br>
            Kids' Page</h4>
          <p> We at the White House are especially concerned about
protecting children's privacy. We hope parents and teachers are involved
in children's Internet explorations. It is particularly important for
parents to guide their children when children are asked to provide
personal information on line. The White House homepage for kids allows
children to send email messages to the White House. We ask children to
type their name, email address, and home mailing address as part of
their message so that we can respond to them.  Providing this information 
is entirely optional. We specifically ask children to get their 
parents' permission before providing any information on line -- 
at our site or any other site -- and hope parents will always be 
involved in those decisions. </p>
