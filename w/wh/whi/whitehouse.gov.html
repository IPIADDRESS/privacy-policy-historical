	 <p>Thank you for visiting the White House Website and reviewing our privacy
		policy. Our privacy policy is clear: We will collect <b> no</b> personal
		information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide
		that information to us.</p> 
	 <p>Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website: </p> 
	 <h4><br> Information Collected and Stored Automatically</h4> 
	 <p>If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read
		pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information
		about your visit automatically. This information does <b>not</b> identify you
		personally. We automatically collect and store <b>only</b> the following
		information about your visit:</p> 
	 <ol> 
		<li>
		  <p>The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a
			 private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a
			 university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is
			 automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from
			 which you access our website; </p></li> 
		<li>
		  <p>The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
			 </p></li> 
		<li>
		  <p>The date and time you access our site; </p></li> 
		<li>
		  <p>The pages you visit; and </p></li> 
		<li>
		  <p>If you linked to the White House website from another website, the
			 address of that website. </p></li> 
	 </ol> 
	 <p>We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors
		-- to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of
		technology our visitors use. We do <b>not</b> track or record information about
		individuals and their visits. </p> 
	 <h4><br> If You Send Us Personal Information</h4> 
	 <p>If you choose to provide us with personal information -- as in an e-mail
		to the President, Vice President or someone else, or by filling out a form with
		your personal information and submitting it to us through our website -- we use
		that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the
		information you have requested. We treat emails the same way we treat letters
		sent to the White House. We are required to maintain many documents under the
		<a href="/cgi-bin/good-bye.cgi?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/44/ch22.html">Presidential Records
		Act</a> for historical purposes, but we do not collect personal information for
		any purpose other than to respond to you. We only share the information you
		give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency,
		or as otherwise required by law. Moreover, we do not create individual profiles
		with the information you provide or to give it to any private organizations.
		The White House does not collect information for commercial marketing. </p> 
	 <h4><br> Links to Other Sites </h4> 
	 <p>Our Website has links to many other federal agencies. In a few cases we
		link to private organizations, with their permission. Before leaving the White
		House website, a page will appear informing you that you are leaving our
		server. Once you link to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of
		the new site. </p> 
	 <h4><br> Kids' Page</h4> 
	 <p>We at the White House are especially concerned about protecting
		children's privacy. We hope parents and teachers are involved in children's
		Internet explorations. It is particularly important for parents to guide their
		children when children are asked to provide personal information on line. The
		White House homepage for kids encourages children to send email messages to the
		White House. We ask children to type their name, email address, and home
		mailing address as part of their message so that we can respond personally to
		them. Providing this information is entirely optional. We specifically ask
		children to get their parents' permission before providing any information on
		line -- at our site or any other site -- and hope parents will always be
		involved in those decisions. Most importantly, when children do provide
		information through the White House website, it is only used to enable us to
		respond to the writer, and not to create profiles of children.</p> <!--End Content Division--><br><br><!--Begin Footer Division--><p></p><hr><p><a href="/WH/EOP/html/principals.html">President and First Lady</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/WH/EOP/OVP/index.html">Vice President and Mrs. Gore</a><br><a href="/WH/Accomplishments/index.html">Record of Progress</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/WH/html/briefroom.html">The Briefing Room</a><br><a href="/WH/html/handbook.html">Gateway to Government</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/WH/EOP/html/contact_the_whitehouse.html">Contacting the White House</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/WH/kids/html/home.html">White House for Kids</a><br><a href="/WH/glimpse/top.html">White House History</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/WH/Tours/visitors_center.html">White House Tours</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/WH/html/helpdsk.html">Help</a><br><a href="/WH/html/privacy.html">Privacy Statement</a></p><!--End Footer Division--><!--Begin Tools Division--><p><a href="/WH/html/helpdsk.html">Help</a></p><p><a href="/site_map.html">Site Map</a></p><p><a href="/textonly/WH/html/privacy.html">Text Only</a></p><!--End Tools Division--><p><a href="/index.html"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">T H E &nbsp; W H I T E &nbsp; H O U S E</font></a></p>
