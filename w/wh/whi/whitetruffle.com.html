Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting the Company’s website at www.oleboo.com or any of Company’s other websites such as www.whitetruffle.com, applications, domain names or other linked pages, (collectively the “Website”), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.  By using the Website, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.

You post any Content (as that term is defined in the Company’s Terms of Use located at http://www.oleboo.com/tos) on the Website at your own risk.  We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that Content you post on the Website will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your Content.
Any improper collection or misuse of Content or other information accessible on the Website is a violation of the Company’s Terms of Use and should be reported to urgent@oleboo.com.

WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?
This Privacy Policy covers Company’s treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Company gathers when you are accessing the Website and when you use our services.  Also, this Privacy Policy covers Company’s treatment of any Personal Information that Company’s business partners share with Company, or that you provide to the Company through a third party website using a Company application.  This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company does not own or control, including Facebook and Linkedin, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.

Company does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Website or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to Company or on the Website. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at urgent@oleboo.com.

WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY DISPLAY OR COLLECT?
When you use the Website, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels. The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with Company through the Website.  In most cases, we retain such information so that, for instance, you can return to view prior actions you have taken or easily see a history of contacts. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.  In addition to the foregoing, we collect the following types of information from our users.

Personal Information You Provide to Us:
We receive and store any information you enter on the Website, whether via computer, mobile phone, other wireless device, or that you provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include, without limitation, your name, email address, IP address, browser information, password, photograph, team preferences, and actions you have taken through the Website. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. You may modify or remove your Personal Information identified below at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and account information.

Personal Information Collected Automatically:
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Website or our services. Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Company cookie information, and the page you requested. We also record the details of your activity on the Website.
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and the Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Company never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

Email Communications:
We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Company if your computer supports this type of program. Company uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. If you do not want to receive email or other messages (including messages we may send you via Facebook) from us, please indicate your preference by choosing the “unsubscribe” option included in each email or message we send you.

What About Cookies?
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Company cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.
Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you will not be able to log in or use many of the Website’s most attractive features without cookies enabled.
Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
