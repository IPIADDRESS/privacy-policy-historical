              <p>We are committed to maintaining the security of Personally Identifiable Information (defined below) obtained through our site. We take significant precautions to protect your Personally Identifiable Information both online and offline. Maintaining a high degree of confidence from you and our service providers regarding the protection and secure transmission of all Personally Identifiable Information obtained through our site is of the utmost importance to us. Accordingly, we back the secure transmission of your credit card information with our Credit Card Guarantee, which you may review by clicking that link at the bottom of each page on this site.<br>
                    <br>
                    We have implemented a security policy to keep Personally Identifiable Information that is stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access. Our systems are configured with data encryption technologies and firewalls. When you send Personally Identifiable Information to us over the Internet, or we send it to service providers over the Internet, your data is protected by 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure safe transmission. We also have a digital certificate from VeriSign, Inc., a top maker of hardware and software used to protect and manage computer network access, certifying the secure nature of our site.<br>
                    <br>
                    All of our servers storing Personally Identifiable Information are kept in a secure environment, and may be accessed only by a limited number of authorized persons. All of our employees are reminded on a regular basis as to the importance we place on privacy and the protection of Personally Identifiable Information regarding residents. All of our employees have signed written confidentiality agreements specifically prohibiting their use or dissemination of such information in any unauthorized manner.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="head2">Information Collected About You</span></p>
                <p>We collect information about you that is provided by you to us or a Site Partner, such as your name, address, prior address, telephone numbers, email addresses and other information that can identify you as a specific individual ("Personally Identifiable Information"). On those pages of our site where Personally Identifiable Information is collected in order for you to purchase or request further information about a product or service, we describe what information is required in order to provide you with the product, service or information that you have requested. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If a Service Provider requires a birth date to order a specific product or service, you will not be able to enter a birth date that indicates that you are less than 13 years old. We collect Personally Identifiable Information when you:</p>
                    
                    <ul><li>Become authorized to use our site through a Site Partner</li>
                    <li>Purchase a product or service</li>
                    <li>Request further information regarding a product or service</li>
                    <li>Disconnect a service</li>
                    <li>Contact us</li></ul>
                <p class="head2">Your Information</p>
                <p>You and/or a Site Partner representative may provide us with the Personally Identifiable Information necessary to allow you to use our site and to optimize your use of our service. This Personally Identifiable Information will include your name and address and may include other Personally Identifiable Information that you or a Site Partner determines will enhance your experience in using our site, such as your prior address, telephone numbers and email addresses. </p>
                <p class="head2">Purchase Information</p>
                <p>We collect credit card information necessary to set up the billing for the services and products that you purchase, which may include card number, card type, cardholder name, billing address and expiration date. If you use automatic deduction (electronic funds transfer) to purchase services or products, we collect account information necessary to set up the billing and payment for the services and products that you purchase. This account information includes the account number, account type, account name and the ABA routing number of the financial institution where the account is located. </p>
                <p class="head2">Requests for Further Information Regarding Products and Services </p>
                <p>When you request additional information or have a question regarding products or services offered on this site, we collect Personally Identifiable Information that the applicable service provider may need to contact you with a response to your request or inquiry.</p>
                <p class="head2">Surveys, Contests and Sweepstakes</p>
                <p>Occasionally, we may offer residents an opportunity to participate in a survey, contest or sweepstakes for the purpose of improving this site or promoting the use of this site. Information collected by us when you participate in a survey, contest or sweepstakes may include Personally Identifiable Information. You may at any time opt out of receiving emails or other notifications from us regarding surveys, contests, or sweepstakes available through this site, by emailing us at CustomerService@WhiteFence.com. </p>
                <p class="head2">Our Service Providers</p>
                <p>It is our intention to maintain reputable service providers to offer residents a variety of products and services on our site. All services and products throughout our site are provided by third parties and are identified and described as such. When choosing to purchase products or services from any service provider, you must take into consideration that you will be transacting business directly with such service provider. The information provided by you and collected by a service provider will be similar to information that would be provided pursuant to a purchase of such product or service by telephone. </p>
                <p class="head2">Cookies</p>
                <p>We do not track your IP address or collect information about your visits to other Internet sites. Certain technical information is automatically collected about your computer each time you request a page during a visit to this site, which information may include your IP address, operating system and web browser software (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer). We assign you a "cookie" (i.e., a tiny packet of identifying information passed between your browser and a web site) each time you visit this site. You do not provide this information -- it is collected automatically as a means for supporting your visit to this site. This cookie does not contain any Personally Identifiable Information and is destroyed after you logout of the site. You can always choose to not receive a cookie file by enabling your web browser to refuse cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie. Please be aware that by refusing to accept a cookie you will not be able to make optimal use of this site. </p>
                <p class="head2">Use of Your Personally Identifiable Information</p>
                <p>Personally Identifiable Information collected on this site may be used to:</p>
                  <ul><li>Facilitate your orders for services and products</li>
                  <li>Send notifications</li>
                  <li>Respond to your questions or suggestions</li>
                  <li>Improve the quality of our site</li></ul>
                  <p class="head2">Ordering Products and Services</p>
                <p>Information collected when you order a product or service is used to confirm and process that order, and may be re-used to assist with the processing of your orders of other products and services. For example, if you desire to purchase multiple products and services using the same credit card, you will be able to submit your purchase orders without retyping your credit card information each time. In addition, information collected from you when you order products or services is used to process the billing and payment for these services through your credit card or automatic deduction (electronic funds transfer) account, if applicable. If you set up an ongoing billing and payment account with any of our service providers, these ongoing (usually monthly) charges to your credit card or automatic deduction account will be billed and collected directly by the service provider. </p>
                <p class="head2">Notifications</p>
                <p>Service providers that you select may use your email address or telephone number to contact you in order to confirm or arrange service appointments, answer questions or provide requested information, or to resolve outstanding issues pertinent to the delivery of products or services ordered by you. We and your selected service providers may use your email address or other contact information to send you notifications about new features, products, services, specials, service providers, promotions or other opportunities available through this site, or to confirm or improve customer service. You will have the opportunity upon the receipt of any promotional emails not pertaining to the status of any of your orders to unsubscribe from receiving such promotional emails in the future.</p>
                <p class="head2">Opt In Policy</p>
                <p>We may from time to time share information with our service providers or other business affiliates as may be necessary to provide you with information about new products or services, special discounts and other information that we believe may be of interest to you. In the event we decide to share information in this manner, we will not share your Personally Identifiable Information in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement unless you specifically elect to make your Personally Identifiable Information available to third parties by checking the applicable opt in box or boxes located on our site. Your opt in elections will not, however, require us to share your Personally Identifiable Information with any third parties.</p>
                <p class="head2">Responses to Your Questions or Suggestions</p>
                <p>We will use your email address or telephone number to respond when you submit a question or suggestion, or request assistance with using or accessing this site. </p>
                <p class="head2">Improving the Quality of Our Sites</p>
                <p>We may collect information about your computer (IP address, operating system and web browser software) for the purpose of assessing the effectiveness of site content and traffic. This data allows us to improve the quality of your visit by streamlining your ability to navigate the site. We do not track your IP address or collect information about your visits to other Internet sites. Information about you and your use of this site may be aggregated with other information collected on this site or other sites or otherwise used in ways that do not personally identify you or constitute Personally Identifiable Information. This type of aggregated or statistical information may be used by us to improve the quality of our site or for other purposes that we may deem appropriate. </p>
                <p class="head2">Sharing Your Personally Identifiable Information</p>
                <p>We do not sell, share or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. </p>
                <p class="head2">Service Providers</p>
                <p>When you order a product or service, we deliver Personally Identifiable Information provided by you, including purchase information, to the service provider that you selected to provide you with such product or service. Our service providers will require certain information about you, including applicable billing and payment information, in order to fulfill your purchase order or service initiations. When you purchase a product or service, you are contracting directly with the applicable service provider offering the purchased product or service. We provide the forum for and facilitate the processing of your orders. The applicable service provider will be responsible for the fulfillment, delivery, billing, customer service, warranty and support of its own products and services. We recommend that you examine the privacy policies of all third parties from which you purchase products and services, whether through our site, by telephone, in person or by other means, to understand their procedures for using and disclosing your Personally Identifiable Information. When you request further information about a service provider or its products or services, we deliver Personally Identifiable Information provided by you to enable that service provider to contact you regarding your requested information. We may also from time to time provide you with information about products or services, special discounts and other information regarding our sites. You will have the opportunity upon the receipt of any promotional emails not pertaining to the status of any of your orders to unsubscribe from receiving such promotional emails in the future.</p>
                <p class="head2">Site Partner</p>
                <p>A Site Partner will not have access to your credit card or automatic deduction account information, or other sensitive data that you may provide to service providers, such as your social security number, unless you provide such information to such Site Partner through other means. We may share information with a Site Partner regarding your use of this site and the products and services that you purchase from our service providers. </p>
                <p class="head2">Legal Obligations</p>
              <p>If required by law, we may disclose information you have provided in connection with your use of this site or the purchase of products and services. We may also disclose information about someone who poses a threat to our interests (such as customer fraud) or whose activities could bring harm to others.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="head2">My Profile</span> </p>
                <p>The My Profile area of this site allows you to view, correct or delete information collected about you. If you delete information contained in My Profile, such as credit card or contact information, you may not be able to fully enjoy many of the features and advantages available through our site. You may also inadvertently cancel pending service orders by deleting information required to process these pending orders. You may check the status of your service orders by visiting the My Orders area of this site. Information deleted from My Profile will be removed from all viewable screens on this site, but may remain in our archives.</p>
                <p class="head2">Notifications of Changes </p>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify or amend this Privacy and Security Statement at any time and for any reason. If we are going to use your Personally Identifiable Information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this materially different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. </p>
                <p class="head2">Contacting Us</p>
