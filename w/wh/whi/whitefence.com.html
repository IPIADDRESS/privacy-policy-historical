Our systems are configured with data encryption technologies and firewalls. When you send Personally Identifiable Information to us over the Internet, or we send it to service providers over the Internet, your data is protected by 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure safe transmission.

<h2 class="subhead-blue">Cookies</h2>
<p class="copy">We do not track or collect information about your visits to other Internet sites. Certain technical information is automatically collected about your computer each time you request a page during a visit to this site. This information may include your IP address, operating system and Web browser software (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer). We assign you a "cookie" (i.e., a tiny packet of identifying information passed between your browser and a Web site) each time you visit this site.

<p class="copy">Information collected when you order a product or service is used to confirm and process that order, and may be reused to assist with the processing of your orders of other products and services.

In addition, information collected from you when you order products or services is used to process the billing and payment for these services through your credit card or automatic deduction (electronic funds transfer) account, if applicable.
