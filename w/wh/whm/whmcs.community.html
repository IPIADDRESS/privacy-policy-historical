<h2>What this policy covers</h2>

<p>WHMCS Limited ("WHMCS") respects and values your privacy.

<p>WHMCS reserves the right to revise, modify, add or remove provisions to this Privacy Policy at any time. In the event that WHMCS do so, WHMCS will notify you in accordance with the notice provisions of WHMCS' Terms of Service. Take note of the 'Last Updated' date listed at the foot of this Privacy Policy. If WHMCS make changes to this Privacy Policy, WHMCS will update that date to notify you of the date of such changes. By continuing to use www.whmcs.com ("the Website") after receiving notice of the updated Privacy Policy, you acknowledge that you have read and understand the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Capitalised terms in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to such terms in WHMCS' Terms of Service.</p>

<h2 id="how">How does WHMCS collect information from you?</h2>

<p>WHMCS collects information from you when you send it to WHMCS directly by filling out forms on WHMCS' Website (including any application you may make for Services or the Software), corresponding with WHMCS by e-mail, writing to WHMCS by post, or speaking to WHMCS by telephone. WHMCS also collect information from you when you browse the Website and use the Software, as set out in detail below. Some of the methods WHMCS use to collect data are automated and will take effect automatically as you navigate the Website and/or use the Software.</p>

<h2 id="info">What information does WHMCS collect?</h2>

<h3>Personal Information.</h3>

<p>Personal information means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person ("Personal Information").</p>

<p>WHMCS may collect the following Personal Information from you: name, address, telephone number, postal address, e-mail address, IP address, information about the type of browser you use, your operating system, the screen resolution of your browser, your ISP, which pages you view on the Website and the time and duration of your visits to the Website, credit card number (in the case of direct customers) and, if applicable, company name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number or tax ID number as well as similar information concerning technical contacts, marketing contacts, and executive contacts within your company or organisation.</p>

<h3>User Communications.</h3>

<p>If you communicate with WHMCS, WHMCS may collect information relating to that communication whether it takes the form of e-mail, letter, forum posting, testimonials or any other form of communication between you and WHMCS or submitted by you to the Website (collectively, "User Communications").</p>

<h3>Server Information.</h3>

<p>If you use one of WHMCS' software products such as WHMCS' proprietary Web Hosting, Billing and Automation Solution, WHMCS may collect certain information concerning such software and concerning the server upon which the software operates. This information includes without limitation: (a) the licensed or unlicensed status of the software; (b) the source from which the license for the software was obtained (i.e., WHMCS or a WHMCS affiliate); or (c) information about the server upon which the software is installed including (i) the public IP address, (ii) the operating system and (iii) the use of any virtualization technologies on such server ((a) through (c) collectively, "Server Information")). Additionally, "Server Information" may also include information collected by WHMCS from time to time concerning which features of the software are most often used in order to improve and make adjustments to the software; and information collected from you by WHMCS in the event that you request technical support services including without limitation, IP addresses, usernames and passwords necessary to login to SSH, the root directory of the server upon which you installed the WHMCS software and any affected accounts including email accounts, MySQL accounts and other accounts.</p>

<h3>Non-Personal Information.</h3>

<p>WHMCS also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. WHMCS may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.</p>

<h2 id="under13">What information does WHMCS collect if you're under the age of 13?</h2>

<p>WHMCS does not knowingly collect Personal Information about children under the age of 13. If WHMCS becomes aware that it has inadvertently collected Personal Information about children under the age of 13, it will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible, except where WHMCS is required by applicable law to keep it.</p>

<p>Where WHMCS knows a child is above the age of 13, but considered a minor under applicable law, WHMCS will obtain parental/guardian consent prior to using that child's Personal Information.</p>

<h2 id="store">How does WHMCS use and store the information it collects?</h2>

<p>As a general matter, WHMCS may use the Personal Information you disclose to WHMCS to improve and provide the Website, the Services and WHMCS' other products and services, and for the specific purpose that you gave WHMCS your Personal Information. More specific details on how WHMCS use your information follows below.</p>

<p>WHMCS may use Personal Information to create and authenticate your account, to process transactions you request such as software license purchases in order to perform any contract you have entered into with WHMCS, to provide you with customer and technical support and to communicate with you about your account and WHMCS' products and services.</p>

<p>The Personal Information you provide to WHMCS allows WHMCS to provide you with the newsletters and mailing lists that you have signed up for with WHMCS. If you do not want to be on WHMCS' mailing list, you can opt out at any time by changing your settings in your 'My Details' page within the client area.</p>

<p>WHMCS may also use Personal Information to offer, market or advertise to you WHMCS products and services. While such WHMCS products and services may reference, incorporate or include third-party products and services, WHMCS will not use your Personal Information to independently offer, market or advertise third-party products and services unless WHMCS first obtain your consent to do so.</p>

<p>From time to time, WHMCS may use your Personal Information to send important notices, such as important product updates and communications about purchases as well as changes to WHMCS' terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important for your interaction with WHMCS you may not opt out of receiving these communications.</p>

<p>WHMCS may also use your Personal Information for any other legal purpose stated in this Privacy Policy, and any other purpose for which you have given WHMCS express consent.</p>

<p>Where you consent to WHMCS doing so, WHMCS may use your Personal Information to send you direct marketing communications. Should you ever choose to 'opt out' of receiving such communications WHMCS may retain your Personal Information on file to ensure that WHMCS do not continue to target you with communications of the type that you have asked WHMCS to cease sending to you.</p>

<p>WHMCS limits the use of Personal Information to the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy and for which you have provided explicit consent. In accordance with established policies and procedures, WHMCS retains Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfil the stated purposes, unless it is required by law for a different period or WHMCS has the consent of the individual.</p>

<p>In accordance with established policies and procedures, WHMCS will periodically destroy or erase any Personal Information that is no longer needed.</p>

<p>WHMCS may use User Communications in the same way as WHMCS uses Personal Information. If you communicate with WHMCS for a particular purpose, WHMCS may use your User Communications for that purpose. For example, if you contact WHMCS for technical support, WHMCS may use your communications to provide technical support to you.</p>

<p>WHMCS may use Server Information to provide you with technical support services and to maintain, evaluate, improve and provide WHMCS products and services. WHMCS may also use such information to investigate unlicensed (and therefore unauthorised) uses of WHMCS' software.</p>

<h2 id="where">Where is your Personal Information stored?</h2>

<p>WHMCS IS A GLOBAL COMPANY AND YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE HELD IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA ("EEA"). YOUR PERONAL DATA MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO AND STORED AT OUR US OFFICE AND ASSOCIATED DATACENTERS AND BY ACCEPTING OUR TERMS OF SERVICE AND/OR A SOFTWARE EULA, YOU ARE EXPLICITLY CONSENTING TO THIS TRANSFER AND STORAGE TAKING PLACE. WE WILL TAKE ALL STEPS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS TREATED SECURELY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>

<h2 id="disclose">How does WHMCS disclose the Personal Information it collects?</h2>

<p>Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, WHMCS does not share your Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties other than as set out in this Privacy Policy. WHMCS will never disclose your Personal Information to an unaffiliated third party for the purposes of e-mail or other marketing unless WHMCS first obtain your consent to do so.</p>

<p>WHMCS cannot be responsible for protecting your Personal Information if you share such information in publicly available sections of the Website such as the user forums or testimonials section. You should use your own judgment in disclosing this information on the Website.</p>

<p>In the event that WHMCS is purchased by another company, merges with another company or has a substantial portion of its assets purchased by another company, WHMCS may share your Personal Information with that company. In such an event, WHMCS will notify you in accordance with the notice provisions of the Terms of Use.</p>

<p>WHMCS may share your Personal Information with third parties as permitted or required by applicable law, by a court order or by another judicial or governmental request. WHMCS may also disclose your Personal Information if WHMCS determine that such disclosure is necessary to protect WHMCS's rights and remedies or is necessary for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance. Such disclosures could take place in the context of an investigation or to prevent or take action against illegal activity, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of WHMCS's Terms of Service, applicable EULAs or other WHMCS agreements, or as otherwise required by applicable law. Where this is the case WHMCS will endeavour to give you notice of such disclosures, to the extent that WHMCS are lawfully permitted to do so.</p>

<p>WHMCS may disclose your Personal Information to affiliated third parties that assist WHMCS in providing maintaining, evaluating, improving and providing the Website, the Services and any other WHMCS products and services. WHMCS may disclose your Personal Information to affiliated third parties for the purposes of offering, marketing or advertising WHMCS products and services to you (such WHMCS products and services may reference, incorporate or include third-party products and services). In such an event, WHMCS will take reasonable measures to prevent such affiliated third parties from using your Personal Information for other purposes.</p>

    </li><li>To object to WHMCS processing your Personal Information;
    </li><li>To be informed about the existence of any automated decision making and profiling of your Personal Information, and where appropriate, be provided with meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing that affects you;
