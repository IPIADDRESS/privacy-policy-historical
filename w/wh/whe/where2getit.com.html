			<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
			<p>The where2getit name and reputation were built on a foundation 
			  of trust. Where2getit is committed to working with public policy 
			  organizations, industry groups and government institutions to understand 
			  and address privacy issues as they relate to visitors to our Website. 
			  This online privacy statement tells you about the information where2GetIt 
			  collects through the services available on our website, <a href="http://www.where2getit.com">www.where2getit.com</a> 
			  (the "Website"), how we use that information and how you 
			  can opt out of certain uses of information we may collect. If you 
			  have any questions about our privacy policy or our use of your information, 
			  you can email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@where2getit.com">privacy@where2getit.com</a>.</p>
			<p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING ANY OF 
			  WHERE2GETIT'S SERVICE3S DESCRIBED BELOW. BY USING ANY SUCH SERVICES 
			  YOU ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS POLICY 
			  AND THAT YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE 
			  TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT, SIMPLY EXIT 
			  THIS PAGE WITHOUT ACCESSING OR USING ANY OF OUR SERVICES.</p>
			<p>Below you will find information on a number of topics, including:</p>
			<ol class="numerical">
			  <li>What personally identifiable information of 
				yours or third party personally identification is collected from 
				you through the Website;</li>
			  <li>The organization collecting the information;</li>
			  <li>How the information is used; </li>
			  <li>With whom the information may be shared; </li>
			  <li>What choices are available to you regarding 
				collection, use and distribution of the information; </li>
			  <li>The kind of security procedures that are in

			  <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the 
				information.</li>
			</ol>
			<h6>Information Collection and Use</h6>
			<p>Where2getit is the sole owner of the information collected on the 
			  Website. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others 
			  in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement, without 
			  first obtaining your consent. Where2getit collects information from 
			  our users at various different points on our Website, including 
			  by way of a questionnaire. This information is used to contact the 
			  user about the services on our Website for which he or she has expressed 
			  interest, and also to receive certain mailings from where2getit. 
			  Our clients have the ability to sign up to receive emails from where2getit, 
			  however no such emails will be sent to a client unless such client 
			  has requested to receive it.</p>
			<p>Some of our services may be offered in conjunction with partner 
			  companies, hosting providers, affiliates or other companies or websites 
			  with which we work. In order for us to provide these services to 
			  you, it may be necessary for us to share your personal information 
			  with one of such entities. These parties are not allowed to use 
			  personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing 
			  these services. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can 
			  choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.</p>
			<h6>Cookies</h6>
			<p>A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on a user's hard 
			  drive containing information about the user. As part of offering 
			  and providing personalized services, we may use cookies to store 
			  and sometimes track your information, thereby saving time while 
			  you are on our Website. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still 
			  use the Website, however the user may be limited in some areas of 
			  the Website. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally 
			  identifiable information while on our Website. Generally we use 
			  cookies to:</p>
			<ol class="numerical">
			  <li>Remind us who you are and to access your account 
				information;</li>
			  <li>Track and target the interests of our users 
				to enhance the experience on our Website;</li>
			  <li>Estimate our audience size; and </li>
			  <li>Measure certain traffic patterns.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Some of our business partners may use cookies on our Website (e.g., 
			  advertisers), however we have no access to or control over these 
			  cookies.</p>
			<h6>Log Files</h6>
			<p>Every computer connected to the Internet is given an IP address. 
			  We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Website, track 
			  users' movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate 
			  use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information, 
			  and our web servers do not record the email addresses of our visitors.</p>
			<h6>Sharing</h6>
			<p>As a general rule, except as described in this privacy statement, 
			  we will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information 
			  except when we have your permission or under special circumstances 
			  (such as when we believe the law requires it). We may share aggregated 
			  demographic information with certain partners, affiliates and advertisers, 
			  however, except as described above, this is not linked to any personal 
			  information that can identify any individual person. We may collect, 
			  compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell or otherwise disclose 
			  or use any and all such aggregated information so long as it is 
			  related to the business of the Website. In addition, where2getit 
			  may disclose account or other personal information when we have 
			  reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary 
			  to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may 
			  be causing injury to or interference with where2getit's rights or 
			  property, other Website users or anyone else that could be harmed 
			  by such activities.</p>
			<h6>Links</h6>
			<p>This Website may contain links to other websites. Please be aware 
			  that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other 
			  websites. We encourage our users to remain vigilant when they leave 
			  our Website and to read the privacy statements of each and every 
			  website that collects personally identifiable information. This 
			  privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this 
			  Website.</p>
			<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal 
			  information online — for example on message boards, through 
			  email or in chat areas — that information can be collected 
			  and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online 
			  that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages 
			  from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible 
			  for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any registration 
			  information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are 
			  online.</p>
			<h6>Surveys</h6>
			<p>From time to time our Website may request information from users 
			  via surveys. Participation in these surveys, to the extent we run 
			  any, is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice 
			  whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested 
			  may include contact information (such as name and shipping address) 
			  and demographic information (such as zip code and age level). Survey 
			  information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving 
			  the use and satisfaction of this Website.</p>
			<h6>Security</h6>
			<p>This Website takes numerous precautions to protect our users' information. 
			  When users submit sensitive information via the Website, such information 
			  is protected both on- and offline. Where2getit goes to great lengths 
			  to ensure that no unauthorized parties can access information collected 
			  during the provision of services through the Website.</p>
			<p>We encrypt certain sensitive information using Secure Socket Layer 
			  (SSL) technology to ensure that our visitors' information is safe 
			  as it is sent over the Internet to our server. SSL works by using 
			  a private key to encrypt data that is transferred over the SSL connection. 
			  While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, 
			  we also take many precautions to protect user information offline. 
			  All of our users' sensitive information is restricted in our offices. 
			  While where2getit employs commercially reasonable security measures 
			  to protect our data and seeks to partner with companies which do 
			  the same, we cannot absolutely guarantee the security of any data 
			  transmission over the Internet or any wireless network. Unfortunately, 
			  no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can 
			  be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we therefore are not responsible 
			  for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties 
			  that may receive any such information.</p>
			<h6>Site and Service Updates</h6>
			<p>From time to time we may send our users Website and service announcement 
			  updates. We communicate with the user to provide requested services 
			  and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or 
			  phone.</p>
			<h6>Correction/Updating Personal Information</h6>
			<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as 
              zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, please send 
              an email to <a href="mailto:data@where2getit.com">data@where2getit.com</a> 
              or call customer support at 888.377.2767.</p>
			<h6>Choice/Opt-out</h6>
			<p>Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of receiving 
			  communications and/or allowing us to collect user data at the point 
			  where we ask for the information by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@where2getit.com">privacy@where2getit.com</a>.</p>
			<h6>Notification of Changes</h6>
			<p>If we decide to change our privacy statement, we will post those 
			  changes under the appropriate link on the "home page" 
			  of our Website so our users are always aware of what information 
			  we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, 
			  we disclose it. You are responsible for periodically reviewing this 
			  privacy statement to apprise yourself of any changes. If at any 
			  point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a 
			  manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, 
			  we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice 
			  as to whether or not we use their information in this different 
			  manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy statement 
			  under which the information was collected. </p>
