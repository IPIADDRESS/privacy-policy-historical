<p>If we offer user registration on the Site, to register as a member of the Site, there may be a few options for you to register: Site Registration (as described below), Third Party Social Media Network Sign-On (as described below) and, if you have previously registered on another KK website, application or other interactive service using one of those methods, Single KK Sign-On (as defined and described below) if offered by this Site.  In each case, you are required to either use a pre-existing user name and password (together, your “User ID”) or select a new User ID.</p>
<p><strong>3.1.1.1 Site Registration</strong>.</p>
<p>For Site registration, you are required to select a User ID and may be required to also provide other Information, such as your email address and date of birth.  Additional Information may be requested and/or required during the registration process.  After you have registered for the Site under Site Registration, we may recognize you when you visit certain other KK websites, applications or other interactive services across Devices (such as when you login) and permit you to use Single KK Sign-On (as described below) to register for and login on such other websites, applications or other interactive services, but please note that other KK websites, applications or other interactive services may set additional or different requirements for membership, such as minimum age.</p>
<p><strong>3.1.1.2 Third Party Social Media Network Sign-On</strong>.  We may provide you with the ability to sign on to the Site by using third party social media network credentials (“SMN”).  If you choose to sign-in through an SMN, you may be required to provide us with all or some of the Information required in the Site’s registration form and your use of the Site shall be governed by the applicable SMN’s privacy policy and user agreements as well as this Privacy Policy and the Site’s <a href="/terms/"><strong>Terms of Use Agreement</strong></a>. Please note that the SMN may set additional or different requirements for membership than those set for the Site, such as minimum age.  We, and KK, are not responsible for the use of any such SMN, or for the accuracy, use or misuse of any information that you may disclose to or receive from an SMN or other third party in connection with such use.  If you use an SMN to sign-in, we may receive certain information from such SMN and our use of your Information we receive from any SMN is governed by the relevant policies of any such SMN and any permissions you give us regarding your Information, including, but not limited to, those set forth in this Privacy Policy.  If you have questions about whether a particular feature, function or service of the Site is powered by a third party, you may contact us with your question as provided in <a href="#section12">Section 12.2</a> (Questions) below.</p>
<p>After you have registered for the Site through SMN, we may recognize you when you visit certain other KK websites, applications or other interactive services and permit you to use Single KK Sign-On (as described below) to register for and login on such other websites, applications or other interactive services.</p>
<p><strong>3.1.1.3 Single KK Sign-On</strong>.  If you are not already registered for the Site, but are registered on other KK websites, applications or other interactive services through any of the above methods, we may permit you to use your User ID from such other KK websites, applications or other interactive services to register for and log into this Site (“Single KK Sign-On”), but please note that this Site may set additional or different requirements for membership, such as minimum age, than those requirements set by other KK websites, applications or other interactive services.</p>
<p>Also note that, for your online privacy and security, if other people have access to your Device, we recommend you log out of your account after visiting any of the websites, applications or other interactive services that are associated with your account.</p>
<p><strong>3.1.2 In Connection with Certain Features and Functions.  </strong>We may also provide you with access to certain features or functions that we may offer on the Site, such as the option to participate in commenting, shopping and member profile pages.  To sign up for or participate in these features or functions, you may be required to provide us with certain Information about you in order for us to personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions.  For example, if we offer e-Commerce services on this Site, if you order any of our goods or services through such services, in addition to your name and contact information, we (or our operational service providers that we use to provide the e-Commerce service) may also collect and/or maintain your billing address, shipping address, selections, credit card or other payment instrument information, order number and information about your computer’s internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Site (<em>e.g.,</em> the referring URL).</p>
<p><strong>The Site may also provide features, functions and/or services powered by an SMN or other third party.  For example, Information may be disclosed to an SMN through plug-ins offered by such SMN (such as Likes, Shares or commenting).  Please take care when using any SMN or other third party service and familiarize yourself with the SMN’s or other third party’s policies and agreements, if any, that govern such use. </strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1.3 In Connection with Promotions such as Contests and Sweepstakes.</strong></p>

<p><strong>3.2 Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. </strong></p>
<p>The Site and/or third parties may use<strong> “</strong>cookies”, “web beacons”, Flash local shared objects and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “<u>Tracking Technologies</u>”) to collect Other Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.  “<u>Cookies</u>” are typically html or browser-based text or other files (and often referred to as browser cookies) that help store information, user preferences and/or user activity. “<u>Web beacons</u>” (also known as image tags, gif, tracking pixels or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses.  Flash local shared objects (“<u>LSOs</u>”) (sometimes known as Flash cookies and used if Adobe Flash is used) are text or other files that help store user preferences and/or activity.</p>
<p>These Tracking Technologies collect “click stream” data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site (such as your visits to the Site’s webpages, type of browser use, type of operating system used, date and time of viewing, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences) or other websites, applications or interactive services.  Through these Tracking Technologies, we may collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on this Site and other websites, applications or other interactive services and may also collect or access your IP address (which is automatically assigned to any Device(s) and/or Device and Internet browser combination you use to access the Site) and/or set or access some other identifier unique to the Device(s), Device platform and/or Device-Internet browser combination you use to access the Site (“<u>Identifier</u>”).  For example, we may set a unique alphanumeric Identifier unique to your home computer on Firefox, or access an Identifier provided by a mobile platform, such as the application or advertising Identifiers offered by Apple.  Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process but we may combine any or all of the Other Information we collect using Tracking Technologies and associate it and/or Identifiers with your Personal Information (such as your Single KK Sign-On ID) and/or with other non-personally identifiable unique identifiers assigned by KK or third parties.</p>
<p><strong>3.2.1 The Site’s Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information</strong></p>
<p>By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge and understand that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site and other websites, applications or interactive services through these Tracking Technologies and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you.  See <strong><u>Your Choices</u> </strong>section below for more information on how you can withdraw your consent for certain purposes.</p>
<p>We use Tracking Technologies to enable us to collect and then use Information as described in <a href="#section4">Section 4.2 “<strong>Other Information Collected by Us</strong>”</a> under “<strong><u>How Is Collected Information Used</u></strong>” below.  For example, we use Tracking Technologies to enable Single KK Sign-On, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times or seeing advertisements too frequently, to tailor your experience on the Site by delivering relevant personalized advertising, email marketing and other content and to record if you have opted out of receiving personalized advertising from us.</p>
<p><strong>3.2.2 Third Parties’ Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information</strong></p>
<p>This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, data management platforms, supply side platforms, ad exchanges, traffic or audience measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, “<u>Third Party Service Providers</u>”) to, for example, facilitate personalized advertisements (“<u>Customized Advertising</u>”) and/or other content, serve advertisements on the Site and/or measure and analyze advertising or content effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site.  Customized Advertising enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you for products and services that you might be interested in based on your visits to the Site and other websites, applications or other interactive services you have visited.</p>
<p>Third Party Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and other third parties, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device subject to your choices about those Tracking Technologies (see <strong><u>“Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers”</u></strong> section below and <strong><u>“More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies”</u></strong> section below) and/or they may otherwise collect or have access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Site.</p>
<p>We may also enlist the assistance of Third Party Service Providers so that the Site may set Tracking Technologies.  For example, to the extent necessary to provide basic advertising serving services such as controlling how often you see advertisements or ensuring you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, we may enlist the assistance of such Third Party Service Providers to create, customize or modify Tracking Technologies set by the Site.  See also Section 5.2.1 for more information on this Site’s use of Nielsen’s proprietary measurement software to collect and use video viewing metrics and other information.</p>
<p>Except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site, Third Party Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site, but we may provide to Third Party Service Providers certain Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies set by the Site in order for the Site to provide Customized Advertising or in order for the Third Party Service Providers to provide other services to the Site, such as measuring or analyzing advertising or content effectiveness or traffic on the Site.  For example, in order to analyze traffic on the Site, we may provide to our Third Party Service Providers certain information we collect about your interaction with the Site along with an Identifier so that the Third Party Service Provider may provide analytics services to the Site.</p>

<p><strong>5.2 Your Choices with Respect to Tracking Technologies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.2.1 Tracking Technologies Set By Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers.</strong>  Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers may collect Other Information about you when you visit this Site for Customized Advertising to help identify products and services that may interest you and deliver advertising and/or other content tailored to your interests.   Your opt-out options regarding these Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers are described below.</p>
<ul><li>You can opt-out of the use of Other Information for certain advertising purposes by using opt-out tools provided by Google’s DoubleClick tool at <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/#infochoices"><strong>https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/#infochoices</strong></a>and provided by certain other Third Party Service Providers as described in our Ad Choices link <a href="http://srp.viacom.com/sitefaq.html"><strong>here</strong></a>. If you use such opt-out tools, your choices only apply to the Third Party Service Providers identified in such links.  <strong>Please note that, if third party browser cookies are disabled (whether by you or automatically by the browser or Device) or you subsequently delete browser cookies, the opt-out choices you have exercised may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies or opt out again in order for your opt-out choices to function.</strong></li>
<li>In addition to the Third Party Service Providers described above, these and other Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers may participate in the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp"><strong>Network Advertising Initiative’s Opt-Out Tool</strong></a>and/or the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/"><strong>Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising</strong></a>.

<li>You may also prevent or exercise choices regarding the use of certain Tracking Technologies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls for the Internet browser as described in Section 5, More Information About Cookie Controls. Please note that using those controls may affect Tracking Technologies which are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.</li>
<li>See the <strong><u>“More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies”</u></strong> section below for additional information about managing Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and for information on your choices regarding Identifiers on mobile platforms.</li>
</ul><p><strong>5.2.2. Tracking Technologies Set By the Site.  </strong>With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Site, you have a number of options:</p>
<ul><li>You can prevent or exercise choices regarding the use of certain Tracking Technologies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls in your Internet browser as described in <strong><u>More Information About Cookie Controls</u></strong> section below.  Please note that using those controls may affect Tracking Technologies which are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.</li>
<li>See the <strong><u>“More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies”</u></strong> section below for additional information about managing Tracking Technologies set by the Site and for information on your choices regarding Identifiers on mobile platforms.</li>
</ul><p>This Site is committed to complying with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.</p>
<p>Please note that if you exercise the Ad Choices opt-out above, that only applies to the use of the data for Customized Advertising and we may still use the data for other purposes described in Section 4.2 <strong><u>“How is Collected Information Used”</u></strong> above, such as for video playhead tracking and to optimize your video experience.</p>
<p><strong>5.2.3. More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies.  </strong>With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Site, Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, please note the following with respect to the above opt-out options:</p>
<ul><li><strong><u>More Information About Cookie Controls</u>.  </strong>For the following Internet browsers, you may prevent or exercise choices regarding browser cookies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls described in the following:</li>
</ul><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/delete-manage-cookies#ie=ie-11"><strong>Internet Explorer 11</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95647"><strong>Chrome</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy/use-of-cookies"><strong>Safari</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer"><strong>Firefox</strong></a></p>
<p>If your Internet browser is not listed above or you otherwise are having difficulties with the links, you may be able to access controls to:</p>
<p>–  Delete <u>existing browser cookies </u>through the “Internet Options”, “Settings”, Preferences”, “Options” or similar menu selection in your browser’s menu or otherwise as directed by your browser’s support feature, which means that all pre-existing browser cookies are deleted but does not prevent browser cookies from being used in the future.</p>
<p>–  Disable <u>browser cookies</u> through the same browser controls which means that browser cookies shall not be used in the future but pre-existing browser cookies may not be deleted.  Additional information on enabling or disabling browser cookies and other Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser’s support feature.  (See the “help” section of your browser for more information.)  Disabling may sometimes be referred to as blocking or opting out of browser cookies and relies on browser cookies to remember your choices.  If you delete browser cookies using the controls in your Web browser (as described above) after disabling browser cookies, you may have to disable browser cookies again to re-establish your preferences.</p>
<p>–  Choose to have the Device you use to access the Site warn you each time a browser cookie or certain other non-Flash LSO Tracking Technology is being set.  (You can later choose to turn-off such warnings.)  This may be available through your Internet browser on the Device you use to access the Site.  Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser’s support feature.</p>
<p>–  Seek additional information from the provider of your Internet browser through your browser’s support features.</p>
<p>The above options may cover browser cookies set by the Site, browser cookies not set by the Site (sometimes called third party cookies) and/or both types of browser cookies.  <strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT CONTROL AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPERATION OF THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS.  ALSO, PLEASE NOTE THAT These browser cookie controls are different from Do Not Track options that may also be offered by certain browsers.</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong><u>Many tools discussed above are “Internet browser cookie based</u>.”</strong></li>
</ul><p>This means that such tools rely on cookies to remember your choices.  For example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking Technologies again to re-establish your preferences and, if you exercise opt-outs through the mechanisms described in our Ad Choices link, and then delete or block browser cookies, you may need to exercise your opt-outs through these mechanisms again.</p>
<ul><li><strong><u>The tools are “Internet browser and Device-specific” or “Device-specific”</u></strong></li>
</ul><p>Note that when you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific Internet browser on that Device and not across Devices.  This means, for example, that if you block or disable browser cookies for Internet Explorer 9 on one Device, this choice shall not block or disable browser cookies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device or on a different Device using Internet Explorer 9.  Further, you may need to separately exercise your options for other platforms, such as mobile platform (as described below).</p>
<ul><li><strong><u>Automatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs</u>.</strong> Some Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable browser cookies from websites, applications or other interactive services other than those you visit directly (sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, <strong>if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function</strong>.  For example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network Advertising Initiative site may not function.</li>
<li><strong><u>You shall still receive advertisements</u>.</strong> Deleting or disabling Third Party Service Providers’, Advertisers’ or the Site’s Tracking Technologies does not mean that you shall no longer receive online ads.  If you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you shall continue to see ads on this Site and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable Tracking Technologies set by third parties or unless we offer alternative means such as enlisting the assistance of Third Party Service Providers in order for the Site to set Tracking Technologies for frequency capping purposes as described in the <strong><u>“Information Collected Through the Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies”</u></strong> section.</li>
<li><strong><u>Limitations Regarding Web Beacons</u>.</strong> Web beacons cannot be deleted or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such web beacons rely on browser cookies or other deleted or disabled Tracking Technologies to track your activities.</li>
<li><strong><u>How to Manage Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies)</u>.</strong></li>
</ul><p><strong>Control of Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies) Must Be Handled Separately.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH LSOs TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR INTERNET BROWSER.</strong>  Deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and set by this Site through the above options shall not remove Flash LSOs.  For more information about Flash LSOs and how to remove them from your computer, please visit <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html"><strong>http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html</strong></a>. If you remove Flash LSOs, you may not have access to certain features of the Site and some of our other services may not function properly.</p>
<ul><li><strong><u>Mobile Platforms</u>.</strong></li>
</ul><p>Certain mobile platforms, such as Apple or Google, may offer users choice regarding the Identifiers we, Third Party Service Providers or Advertisers may access and use, which may not be browser cookie based.  We encourage you to review and understand the choices that such mobile platforms may provide to you regarding these Identifiers.</p>
<ul><li><strong><u>Certain Identifiers</u>.</strong></li>
</ul><p>Certain Identifiers we set may not be deleted, blocked or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such Identifiers rely on, or are associated with, browser cookies or other Tracking Technologies.</p>
<ul><li><strong><u>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms</u>.</strong></li>
</ul><p>Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the browser communicates.  Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.  There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.</p>
<p>We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.  Instead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for Customized Advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described in this Section 5.2.3 and in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.</p>
