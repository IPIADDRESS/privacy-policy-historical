For example, SPE collects information when you use or register for the Service, subscribe to notifications, post on the Service, participate in promotional activities, or communicate or transact with SPE through the Service.

	<p class="indent10em">ii.

In addition, Personal Information, including, without limitation, SPE-Collected PI (defined below), once "de-identified" (i.e., the removal of personal identifiers from data or other means to make it no longer reasonably identifiable and no attempt made to reidentify the information to an individual) is also non-Personal Information and may be used and shared without obligation to you, except as prohibited by applicable law. To the extent any non- Personal Information is combined by or on behalf of SPE with Personal Information SPE itself collects directly from you on the Service ("SPE-Collected PI"), SPE will treat the combined data as SPE-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy.</p>

	<p class="indent5em" id="section1B"><strong>B. Information Collected Automatically.</strong></p>

	<p>SPE, its Service Providers, and/or Third-Party Services may also automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use the Service ("Usage Information").

			</li>
			<li>
			<p id="inapp"><strong>In-App Tracking Methods</strong></p>

			<p>There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings.

	<p>Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third-Party Services may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services, and used by SPE, Sony Companies, and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain ThirdParty Services.

	<h5 id="sharing-of-information">SHARING OF INFORMATION</h5>

	<p>SPE may share non-Personal Information, and Personal Information that is not deemed SPE-Collected PI hereunder (provided that SPE is aware of no restrictions on SPE’s use, if any), with third parties, including without limitation other Sony Companies for any purpose. SPE’s sharing of SPE-Collected PI is, however, subject to the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><u>Marketing</u>: While on the Service, you may have the opportunity to consent (which may be by opt-in or election not to opt-out) to receive information and/or marketing offers from someone else or to otherwise consent to the sharing of SPE-Collected PI with a third party. Absent your consent (which may be by means of third party interaction described in the next bullet point), however, SPE will not share your SPE-Collected PI with third parties, other than Sony Companies (except as otherwise required by applicable law), for their own direct marketing purposes, except in connection with Corporate Transactions (defined below).</li>
		<li><u>Your Disclosure or Consent</u>: As more fully described in <a href="#section5">Section 5</a> (Information You Disclose Publicly or to Others) and <a href="#section6">Section 6</a> (Third-Party Services, Social Features, Advertising and Analytics), your activities on the Service may, by their nature, result in the sharing of your SPE-Collected PI (as well as your other Personal Information and your non-Personal Information) with third parties, and by engaging in these activities you consent to that and further sharing and disclosure to third parties. Such third party data receipt and collection is subject to the privacy and business practices of that third party, not SPE.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>SPE may also share any information about you (including, without limitation, SPE-Collected PI) for any purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy, or otherwise not prohibited by applicable law, including, without limitation:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>To SPE’s agents, vendors, consultants, and other service providers (collectively "Service Providers") who may receive, or be given access to your information, including, without limitation, Personal Information, non-Personal Information, and Usage Information, in connection with their work on SPE’s behalf. For more information on choices Service Providers may offer you click <a href="#choices">here</a>.</li>
		<li>To comply with the law, law enforcement or other legal process, and in response to a government request;</li>
		<li>If SPE believes your actions are inconsistent with SPE’s terms of use, user agreements, applicable terms or policies, or to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of SPE, the Service or its users, or any third party; and,</li>
		<li>SPE may share your SPE-Collected PI (as well as your other Personal Information and your non-Personal Information), in connection with or during negotiations of any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale, joint venture, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of SPE assets, or transfer of all or a portion of SPE’s business to another company ("Corporate Transactions").</li>

	<p>SPE may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a "Promotion"), including Promotions jointly sponsored or offered by third parties, which may require submitting Personal Information. If you voluntarily choose to enter a Promotion, your information, including Personal Information, may be disclosed to SPE, co-sponsors, Service Providers, Sony Companies and other third parties, including for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners list).

	<h5 id="section5">INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE PUBLICLY OR TO OTHERS</h5>

	<p>The Service may permit you to post or submit UGC including, without limitation, written content, user profiles, audio or visual recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, or other content, including Personal Information. If you choose to submit UGC to any public area of the Service, your UGC will be considered “public” and will be accessible by anyone, including SPE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Personal Information included in UGC is not subject to SPE’s usage or sharing limitations, or other obligations, regarding SPE-Collected PI or other Personal Information under this Privacy Policy or otherwise, and may be used and shared by SPE and third parties to the extent consistent with this Privacy Policy or not prohibited by applicable law. SPE encourages you to exercise caution when making decisions about what you disclose in such public areas. For more information on how UGC is treated under the Service’s Terms of Use click <a href="/corp/tos.html#content-you-submit">here</a>. California minors should see <a href="#childrens-privacy">Section 9</a> regarding potential removal of certain UGC they have posted on the Service.</p>

	<p>Additionally, the Service may offer you the option to send a communication to a friend. If so, SPE relies on you to only send to people that have given you permission to do so. The friend’s Personal Information you provide (<em>e.g.</em>, name, e-mail address) will be used to facilitate the communication, but not used by SPE for any other marketing purpose unless SPE obtains consent from that person. Your contact information and message may be included in the communication.</p>

	<li>
	<h5 id="section6">THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, SOCIAL FEATURES, ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS</h5>

	<p>The Service may include hyperlinks to, or include on or in connection with, the Service (e.g., apps and plug-ins), websites, locations, platforms, applications or services operated by third parties ("Third-Party Service(s)". These Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other Tracking Technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you. Their privacy policies apply in such cases, and not this Privacy Policy.</p>

	<p>Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain Third- Party Services, such as third-party social networks ("Social Features"). Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Service and a Third-Party Service; “liking” or “sharing” SPE’s content; logging in to the Service using your Third-Party Service account (<em>e.g.</em>, using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise connect the Service to a Third-Party Service(<em>e.g.</em>, to pull or push information to or from the Service). If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Service (see <a href="#section5">Section 5</a>) or by the Third- Party Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a Third-Party Service that references the Service (<em>e.g.</em>, by using a hashtag associated with SPE or Sony Companies in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Service or otherwise by SPE and Sony Companies. Also, both SPE and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and any Third-Party Service.</p>

	<p>SPE may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on Third-Party Services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on, for example, your browsing of the Service and elsewhere on the internet, sometimes referred to as “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral advertising” ("Interest-based Advertising"), which may include sending you an ad on a Third-Party Service after you have left the Service (i.e., “retargeting”).</p>

	<p>SPE may use Service Providers for analytics services such as, without limitation, Google Analytics. These analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help SPE analyze Service users and how they use the Service. Information generated by these services (<em>e.g.</em>, your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these Service Providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Service, compiling statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and providing other services relating to Service activity and other internet usage.</p>

	<p>Except to the extent SPE combines information from Service Providers, Third-Party Services, or other third parties with SPE-Collected PI, in which case SPE will treat the combined information as SPE-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy (see <a href="#section1C">Section 1(c)</a>), data obtained by SPE from a third party, even in association with the Service, is not subject to SPE’s limitations regarding SPE-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy. However such data remains subject to any restrictions imposed on SPE by the third party, if any. Otherwise, the information collected, stored, and shared by third parties remains subject to their privacy policies and practices, including whether they continue to share information with SPE, the types of information shared, and your choices on what is visible to others on Third- Party Services.</p>

	<p>SPE is not responsible for and makes no representations regarding the policies or business practices of any third parties, including, without limitation, analytics Service Providers and Third-Party Services associated with the Service, and encourages you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. See <a href="#choices">Section 11</a> for more on certain choices offered by some third parties regarding their data collection and use, including regarding Interest-based Advertising and analytics.</p>

	<h5 id="data-security">DATA SECURITY AND MONITORING</h5>

	<p>SPE takes reasonable measures to protect SPE-Collected PI (excluding UGC) from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet and online digital storage are not completely secure and SPE cannot guarantee the security of your information collected through the Service.</p>

	<p>To help protect you and others, SPE and its Service Providers may (but make no commitment to) collect and use information including usage of the Service, SPE-Collected PI and other Personal Information for all purposes not prohibited by applicable law or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, including, without limitation, to identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and investigate and/or seek prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse of the Service; ensure compliance with the <a href="/corp/tos.html" rel="external">Terms of Use</a> and this Privacy Policy; investigate violations of or enforce these agreements; and otherwise to protect the rights and property of SPE and Sony Companies, their partners, and customers. Such monitoring may result in the collection, logging, and analysis of online activity or communications through our Service. If you do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your use of the Service.</p>

	<p>SPE does not knowingly collect personal information as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") ("Children’s Personal Information") in a manner that is not permitted by COPPA, and for any children’s or mixed-use portions of the Service (if any) SPE will comply with COPPA.

	<p>Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Service, and who have posted content or information on the Service, can request removal by contacting SPE <a href="https://secure.sonypictures.com/corp/contactus.html" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>, detailing where the content or information is posted and attesting that you posted it. SPE will then make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third parties may have republished or archived content by search engines and others that SPE does not control. SPE does not "sell" (as that term is defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)) Personal Information gathered from sites that link to the Children's Privacy Policy. For further information regarding the sale of Personal Information under the CCPA, please see Section 12.B. below.</p>

	<h5 id="choices">CHOICES: TRACKING AND COMMUNICATIONS OPTIONS</h5>

	<p class="indent5em"><strong>A. Tracking Technologies Generally. </strong></p>

	<p>Regular cookies and tracking pixels, among other Tracking Technologies, may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies, or other Tracking Technologies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s website <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html</a>. You can also manage the use of some Tracking Technologies such as without limitation cookies and tracking pixels by using SPE’s <a href="#" onclick="event.preventDefault(); window.evidon.notice.showPreferencesDialog();">Cookie Consent Tool</a>. Please be aware that every website utilizes its own cookies, so cookie preferences should be set for each SPE website. If you choose to opt out of any Tracking Technologies such as without limitation cookies and pixels, a preference cookie will be placed on your device in order to honor that opt-out. If you later clear your browser and delete cookies from your device, by doing so you will also remove the preference cookie. Therefore, in order to remain opted out of Tracking technologies, you will have to go back to the cookie management tool and renew your choices. Please remember that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</p>

	<p>App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (<em>e.g.</em>, most functionality of a mobile app) can be disabled by uninstalling the app and in some instances by using the cookie management tool in the app you are using. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or device manufacturer.</p>

	<p>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many online services, SPE currently does not alter SPE’s practices when SPE receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you can visit <a href="https://www.allaboutdnt.com" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>, but SPE is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information. Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies. SPE is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of third party choice notices or choice mechanisms. For specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party analytics and advertising providers, see the next section.</p>

	<p class="indent5em" id="section11B"><strong>B. Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies.</strong></p>

	<p>You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a> or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Microsoft by going to http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement.</p>

	<p>You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising online, visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>, and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a> for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>. Opting out does not mean that you will no longer receive ads, but that the ads you see will no longer be relevant to your preferences. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use of a different device or web browsers or use a non-browser-based method of access (<em>e.g.</em>, mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. SPE supports the ad industry’s 2009 Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (<a href=" https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf</a>). SPE is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.</p>

	<p class="indent5em"><strong>C. Mobile Apps.</strong></p>

	<p>With respect to SPE’s mobile apps ("apps"), you can stop all collection of data generated by use of the app by uninstalling the app. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device. See also the prior section regarding the DAA’s mobile Interest-based Advertising choices.</p>

	<p class="indent5em" id="section11D"><strong>D. Communications.</strong></p>

	<p>You can opt out of receiving certain promotional communications (emails or text messaging) from SPE at any time by (i) for promotional e-mails, following the instructions provided in emails to click on the unsubscribe link, or if available by changing your communication preferences by logging onto your account; and (ii) for text messages, following the instructions provided in text messages from SPE to text the word, “STOP”. Please note that your opt- out is limited to the e-mail address or phone number used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions. If you opt- out of only certain communications, other subscription communications may continue. Even if you opt-out of receiving promotional communications, SPE may, subject to applicable law, continue to send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, servicing, or SPE’s ongoing business relations.</p>

	<p class="indent5em" id="section11E"><strong>E. Audience Measurement.</strong></p>

	<p>The Service may feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which will enable you to contribute to market research, such as Nielsen TV Ratings. To learn more about the information that Nielsen software may collect and how to opt out, please see the Nielsen Digital Measurement Privacy Policy at http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy</p>

	<h5 id="privacy-rights">YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h5>

	<p class="indent5em" id="section12A"><strong>A. California's "Shine the Light" Law </strong></p>

	<p>SPE only knowingly shares personal information (as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” law), with non- affiliated third parties (i.e., parties other than Sony Companies except as otherwise required by applicable law) for their own direct marketing purposes if you specifically opt-in, or are offered the opportunity to opt-out and elect not to opt-out, to such sharing at the time you provide personal information or choose to participate in a feature on the Service. If you do not opt in or if you opt-out at that time, SPE will not knowingly share the personal information that was collected in connection therewith with such identified non-affiliated third party(ies) (or Sony Companies where required by applicable law) for its/their own direct marketing purposes, but may continue to seek your consent to sharing with the same or other non-affiliated third parties (or Sony Companies where required by applicable law) for their own direct marketing purposes from time-to-time. Each consent notice and opportunity will be treated separately so it is possible that you may consent to some sharing but not to others.</p>

	<p>In addition, California residents may request information about SPE’s compliance with the Shine the Light law and the Sony Companies with which SPE may have shared personal information for their direct marketing purposes by contacting SPE <a href="https://secure.sonypictures.com/corp/contactus.html" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> or by sending a letter to Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. at 10202 W. Washington, Jimmy Stewart Building, Culver City, CA 90232 (Attention: Privacy Program, Information Security). Requests must include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that SPE is only required to respond to one such request per customer each year, and SPE is not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided e-mail address or mail address.</p>

<p><strong><u>THE FOLLOWING SECTION 12.B. IS EFFECTIVE ONLY AS OF JANUARY 1, 2020</u></strong></p>

	<p class="indent5em" id="section12B"><strong>B. The California Consumer Privacy Act (also known as the “CCPA”) </strong></p>

	<p>If you are a California resident, California law also provides you with specific rights regarding your Personal Information which are set forth in more detail below.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p id="deletepii"><b>The Right to Delete Personal Information and the Right to Know About Personal Information Collected, Disclosed, or Sold</b></p>

		<p>As a California resident you have the right to request SPE to delete Personal Information which SPE has collected from you and the right to request from SPE what Personal Information about you it has collected, used, disclosed, and “sold” about you (as the term “sale” is defined under the CCPA: “the selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration”)and the right to request that we stop any such “sales.” SPE does not trade in consumers’ Personal Information nor receive monetary compensation for it. SPE shares Personal Information with third parties and service providers in compliance with the law in order to deliver more meaningful ads and other communications to consumers, and for other similar reasons provided in this policy. SPE does not sell Personal information gathered from sites that link to the Children's Privacy Policy referenced in Section 9 above.</p>

		<p>SPE will take reasonable steps to verify your identity using information you submit with your request before the request will be processed. We may request additional information from you. To submit a request, you can click <a href="https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/d19e506f-1a64-463d-94e4-914dd635817d/fc46fc0c-407c-4735-9a43-14dfa283d17c.html" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> or contact us at 1-800-782-6588. If you have visited the SPE studios in Culver City, California in person, please click <a href="https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/d19e506f-1a64-463d-94e4-914dd635817d/7a8e3f56-e162-45bb-9fb5-71a91c57c3e9.html" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. Your request is subject to exceptions allowed by law. Please note that SPE is only required to respond to two such requests per California resident each year and only requests from California residents whose identity SPE can reasonably verify.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p id="optoutpii"><b>Right to Opt Out of the Sale of Personal Information</b></p>

		<p>A California resident has the right to opt- out of the sale of their Personal Information by a business.

To opt out of certain Tracking Technologies, click <a href="#" onclick="event.preventDefault(); window.evidon.notice.showPreferencesDialog();">here</a>. Please be aware that every website utilizes its own cookies, so cookie preferences should be set for each SPE website by clicking on the “Cookie Management Tool” in that website’s footer. If you choose to opt out of any Tracking Technologies such as without limitation cookies and pixels, a preference cookie will be placed on your device in order to honor that opt-out. If you later clear your browser and delete cookies from your device, by doing so you will also remove the preference cookie. Therefore, in order to remain opted out of Tracking technologies, you will have to go back to the cookie management tool and renew your choices.</p>

		<li>
		<p><b>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer's Privacy Rights </b></p>

To submit an opt-out request, they should click  <a href="https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/d19e506f-1a64-463d-94e4-914dd635817d/b9eb997c-9ede-451b-8fd4-29891782a928.html" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> . They and/or you will be asked to provide proof of such authorization, i.e., a power of attorney or a letter of authorization and proof of identity. We will contact your agent and/or you with additional details after the request has been received.</p>
