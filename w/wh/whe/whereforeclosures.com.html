<p><strong>Privacy Statement:</strong><br>
We have developed this Privacy Policy to inform you  of the data gathering and dissemination practices applicable to our web site  (Site). By visiting, registering or using services obtained through our Site,  you agree to the 

terms of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;  If you do not agree with any terms of this Policy, please do not use or  submit any personal information to this Site.</p>
<p><strong>WhereForeclosures.com Privacy Pledge:</strong> We do not collect any personal information from you that you do not volunteer, and we are the sole owner of all information collected on this site. We fully disclose 

our privacy policy in this document. If you have any questions or comments, you are invited to <a href="/contact-us.html">contact us</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect:</strong><br>
We collect Personally Identifiable Information when you register to use this Site; when you use, participate or purchase products and services through this Site; and when you ask to be provided additional services.  The type of 

personal information that we collect may include full name, email, telephone number, address, payment information, profession, company name, company website address, business telephone number and photo. This 

personal information is generally required if you wish to enroll or participate in our services. We may use, sell or distribute certain individual personal information to other companies, including related interests or vendors so as to 

provide you with important offers. We may keep all information collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information:</strong><br>
Personally Identifiable Information refers to any information that can be used to identify you as an individual in any way. Enrollment in any WhereForeclosures.com service is contingent upon your agreeing to the Terms and 

Conditions of membership and providing Personally Identifiable Information as described above.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-SPAM Policy:</strong><br>
The WhereForeclosures.com marketing program has a strict policy regarding unsolicited email. Because email is an integral part of our services, your signup ensures that you'll receive information relative to your interests at the 

time of your enrollment from WhereForeclosures.com. If you later wish to cease participation in this portion of our services, you may do so at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link or button found within such message.</p>
<p>Please note that opting not to receive email does not exempt you from receiving administrative and informational emails from us, which include but are not limited to, notices about membership status changes and alterations 

to our Terms.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate Data:</strong><br>We may, from time to time, contact you regarding opportunities that may be of interest to you. In that process, we may use a third party service provider to manage our database and 

communication system in order to send that correspondence to you on our behalf. If you respond to a communication to take advantage of an offer you may see or receive, you share your Personally Identifiable Information with 

a third party. From time to time, we do share non-personally identifiable information collected in aggregate, anonymous form with third parties so that they may better evaluate what products and services are most appealing to 

different segments of our member base.</p>
<p><strong>Automatically Collected Information:</strong><br>
When you log on to our Site, our server may automatically recognize you by an encrypted member key, also referred to as a "cookie." This cookie acts as a unique identifier.</p>
<p>We may use third party cookies and clear pixels (also referred to as "web beacons") to measure page views and email responses. These devices allow us to identify unique visitors to our Site and act as a counter for 

ongoing monitoring of Site, email and corresponding future transaction activity related to a specific offer.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Websites and Services:</strong><br>
We are not responsible or liable for the content or data practices of any third-party site, including those of our advertisers, affiliates, partners, or vendors. We recommend that you read the privacy policy of all third-party sites 

carefully before sharing your Personally Identifiable Information with them.</p>
<p>Occasionally, you may be offered the opportunity to participate in an offer or service that, by its very terms, will require us to forward your Personally Identifiable Information to the advertiser or partner so that they can provide 

the service to you.  As always, it is your choice to participate.</p>
<p>We do not guarantee the content or information practices of any third-party site. You alone are responsible for determining the appropriateness of sharing your Personally Identifiable Information with our advertisers.</p>
<p>We have your consent to share collected personally identifiable information (including email addresses) with third parties for commercial purposes, such as advertising. </p>

<p><strong>Communication:</strong><br>We are available to you during normal business hours to answer any privacy-related questions or concerns you might have. Simply <a href="/contact-us.html">contact us</a> and we 

will respond in a timely manner.</p>
<p>You sign up for our marketing program when you submit the information on the first page of our sign-up process, and our marketing partners or we may contact you via email with offers we think you will like. We have a strict 

Anti-SPAM policy, and you may unsubscribe at any time while still participating in our services.</p>
<p>We do not collect or use any information about you for marketing purposes, except for information that you have provided to us or authorize us to obtain, or is publicly available, and this information is used solely to make our 

programs and services more relevant to your interests.</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong><br>
WhereForeclosures.com has established company-wide  security policies and practices designed  to protect your and others information from unauthorized intrusion. These  practices include, but are not limited to, firewall 

security, the use of  appropriate encryption technology, and the use of multiple levels of password  security. All WhereForeclosures.com employees are required to familiarize themselves  with, and abide by, these safeguards. &nbsp; 

However,  please note that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be  100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information,  we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any 

information you transmit to us  or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Our  policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet,  and therefore beyond our control, 

and is not to be applied in any manner  contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. </p>
<p><strong>A Special Note Regarding Individuals Under 18 Years Old:</strong><br>The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of eighteen (18), and we request that such individuals not provide personal information 

through the Site. If you are under 18 years of age, you may browse our Site; however, you may not provide personal information to us such as name, address, or email address, and you may not register for, enroll in, and/or

Please note that if WhereForeclosures.com  or any lines of its business are sold or disposed of as a going concern,  whether by merger, liquidation, sale of assets or otherwise, its customer  database could, in whole or in part, 

be sold or otherwise transferred to a  third party as part of that transaction. There may be instances when we may  disclose your information without providing you with a choice in order to protect  our legal rights or those of our 

affiliates, or those of our or our affiliates'  employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of  visitors to our web sites; to protect against fraud or for risk management  purposes; or to comply with the law or 

legal process.</p>
<p><strong>International Visitors:</strong><br>
Your information may  be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States or any other  country where we have facilities, and by providing us with your information,  you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of 

such information outside  of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights:</strong><br>

respect to the types of personal information the business shares with third parties for those third parties direct marketing purposes and the identities of the third parties with whom the business has shared such information
