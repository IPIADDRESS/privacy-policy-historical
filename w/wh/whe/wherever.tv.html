                <p><strong>About WhereverTV</strong><br>
                  WhereverTV  is an online service that allows our members to set up individual program  guides that can be linked together through networks of friends. WhereverTV  members can view each others' guides, communicate with old friends and meet new  friends on the service, share video streams, post comments, and describe their  interests. To enrich our members' experience, we request and display some  personal information to other members and visitors, which allows our users to  identify each other and expand their network of friends. WhereverTV members can  change their profile information at any time and can control how other members  and the service communicates with them.</p>
                <p>WhereverTV  cares deeply about online privacy If you have any questions concerning this  privacy policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@wherever.tv">privacy@wherever.tv</a> .</p>
                <p><strong>Information Collection and Used by  WhereverTV</strong><br>

User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.</p>
                <p>User  Profile information, including members' first names, are displayed to people in  order to facilitate user interaction in the WhereverTV social networking  community. Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to  join WhereverTV, to add users to members' friends' networks, and to send  notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends,  adding friends, and notifications, a user's email address is not shared or  displayed to people within a user's personal network.
