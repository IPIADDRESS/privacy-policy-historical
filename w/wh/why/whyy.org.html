 <p class="newsheader">Privacy Policy for whyy.org Visitors</p>
 <br>

<p>Thank you for visiting whyy.org. We know you don't want the information you provide us shared indiscriminately. Here we explain how whyy.org collects information, what we do with it, and what controls you have. We're committed to ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable information, and to protecting your ability to make financial transactions and transmit your personal data with full confidence.</p><br>

<p>Please read our privacy policy carefully, and if you have any questions or concerns, please contact us. Also, note that whyy.org links to numerous other sites, such as PBS and NPR. Please consult those sites to learn more about their policies.</p><br>

<p><strong>Gathering and Use of Information</strong><br>
Neither WHYY, nor our fulfillment agent who supports "WHYY Shop" pages, will willfully disclose any personally identifiable information about our online users to any third party without first receiving the user's permission, unless required by law. The whyy.org Web site and our "WHYY Shop" pages only collect personally identifiable information from our visitors on a voluntary basis (such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and/or other identifying information). You should recognize that under certain circumstances, if you choose not to voluntarily submit requested information, you may not be able to engage in certain activities -- e.g., WHYY schedule personalization, accessing WHYY membership information, entering online contests, purchasing videos or books -- for which personally identifiable information is needed.</p><br>

<!-- 
<p>Registration, Minimum Requirements, and Security<br/>
To serve you better, we offer visitors the option to personalize the Schedule feature of whyy.org, to sign up for free e-mail services, and to gain access to information about their WHYY membership (if this applies) ~~ all by registering a user name and password. These services are free of charge, entirely optional, and designed to enhance your enjoyment of whyy.org.</p><br/>

<p>To administer these services we require a minimum of information from you. This includes a user name (your e-mail address), password, acknowledgment that you are 18 years of age or older, and information about your membership status at WHYY. Our personalized forms are stored and served from a secure server. This means that each page you view and any information you submit is encrypted on its way between computers (yours and ours). In the unlikely event that the information you send is intercepted, it should not be usable by anyone else. While no computer system is 100 percent secure, WHYY has taken reasonable steps to ensure the security of any information you provide to our Web site. Our goal is to offer service while adhering to the best security practices possible; to do so requires your shared cooperation and commitment. Thus, to participate in these optional services you agree to abide by the following terms and conditions:</p><br/>

    * All registration information submitted by you is accurate and updated.
    * You will not select or use an e-mail address of another person with the intent to impersonate that person.
    * You will not use the e-mail address in which another person has rights without that person's authorization.
    * You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. (Please know that if you choose to share your log-in and password, you are providing access to your private information.) 
 -->



<p><strong>Secure Credit Card Transactions</strong><br>
The whyy.org Web site and our "Shop WHYY" pages offer you the convenience of making membership contributions and product purchases via credit card. WHYY and our fulfillment agent, who supports "Shop WHYY" pages, utilize state-of-the-art measures to ensure credit card account information security and to secure any information from your computer to our server. Our Web financial transaction forms are stored and served from secure servers. This means that each page you view and any information you submit is encrypted on its way between computers (yours and ours, or yours and our fulfillment agent's). Even in the highly unlikely event that your transmission is intercepted, it should not be usable. Your peace of mind and the safeguarding of your credit card information are top priorities for us. All online credit card transactions are done through a secure server using 128-bit SSL; you know you're on a secure page when the Web address starts with "https" (the "s" is for "secure"). Your credit card information is used only for your intended purpose -- that is, for the purchase or contribution you wish to make.</p><br>

<p><strong>E-mail Addresses</strong><br>
WHYY and our fulfillment agent, who supports "Shop WHYY" pages, maintain customer databases with e-mail addresses of viewers, listeners and members, Web visitors who have provided them to WHYY by registering at our site, audience members who e-mail questions about membership or programs, donors who submit online membership contributions (that is, make an online pledge), or online buyers who make a purchase. We will use these addresses to send information about WHYY programs, Web sites, services, membership or to correspond about a purchase or product offers.</p><br>

<p>WHYY does not sell, exchange, or lend e-mail addresses to outside companies, organizations, or individuals except where required by law. WHYY will always provide a clear and convenient method of unsubscribing to our e-mailings. <!-- You can unsubscribe at any time by either using any "Personalize" or "Sign in" link on whyy.org and updating your preferences, or by going to whyy.org's Contact Us page. --> Follow the unsubscribe directions included in every e-mail message we send. We will update our records as soon as possible. If you have already unsubscribed from WHYY e-mails, rest assured that we will continue to honor your request.</p><br>

<p>Our fulfillment agent's e-mail database will never be released by them except in response to a lawful court order or when instructed by WHYY. Their sole use of your e-mail address and other information is to communicate with you about your purchase or to answer questions you may ask, unless you have approved another use. If you have approved another use, each e-mail will include unsubscribe instructions.</p><br>

<p><strong>WHYY and Your Postal Address</strong><br>
Like many nonprofits, we occasionally exchange some of our donors' names and postal addresses with carefully selected like-minded nonprofit organizations using a process that does not permit the other organizations to review or retain a copy of the membership list. When you make an online contribution, your name and postal address will be included as eligible for an exchange. Exchange of the list allows WHYY to expand its membership base by obtaining the names and addresses of other likely donors, and provides a valuable source of additional funding.</p><br>

<p>Please note that on every online contribution form, we give you the opportunity to opt out of having your name and address shared. If at any time you would like to check or update our record of your information, please let us know by using the whyy.org <a href="http://www.whyy.org/about/contact.html" class="contentlink">Contact Us</a> page. If you already have opted out of having your name and address exchanged, rest assured that we will continue to honor your request, except where required by law.</p><br>
