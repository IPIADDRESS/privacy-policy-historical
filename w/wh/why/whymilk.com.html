<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
This site ("Milk") has a policy to respect and protect the privacy of its users. This privacy policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Using the Internet should be a fun experience and we want to help you make it so.
</p>
<p>
Milk occasionally collects and stores personal user information in connection with promotions at www.whymilk.com. Whenever information of that kind is collected, Milk checks the ages of all site visitors before accepting information from them. No information is collected from guests under the age of 13 unless parental permission to do so is obtained as described below in the section designated "POLICY FOR KIDS (INDIVIDUALS UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE)."
</p>
<p>
From time to time, Milk requests personal information such as your name, e-mail address and birth date. For example, we may request personal information when you request brochures or information on diet and exercise, or when you register to enter a promotion such as a sweepstakes or contest. Whenever Milk collects and stores such personal user information, information you provide will not be disclosed to third parties without your consent; however, Milk may share aggregate information about our visitors (for example, what percentages of our visitors are male and female) with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties in order to customize the content of our site to deliver a better experience for our visitors.
</p>
<p>
Whether Milk collects personal information for complying with your requests or in connection with your participation in a promotion or for purposes of verifying your compliance with Milk policies and federal, state, and local laws, and/or for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes, we will collect only such information as is necessary for those purposes and nothing more. We will not collect any information from children under 13 that is not necessary for participation in promotions such as sweepstakes or contests or fulfillment of requests for information, prizes or premium items. As more fully described below under the heading "POLICY FOR KIDS," we will not use personal information collected from children under 13 for any purpose except for its intended use, which shall be disclosed at the time such information is requested.
</p>
<p>
Milk may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Milk's rights or property, other Milk users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Milk may also disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>OPTING OUT</strong><br>
Information provided at the time of registration or submission from a guest who is 13 years of age or over may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by Milk. To keep you in control of your personal information and the communications directed to you, you may opt out of receiving communications from Milk about new features or services. If you object to such use for any reason, you may stop that use by e-mail request to milk@webershandwick.com.
</p>
<p>
<strong>POLICY FOR KIDS (INDIVIDUALS UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE)</strong><br>
Milk encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the sites. No information should be submitted to or posted at Milk by guests under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. If Milk collects any personal information from children under 13 (and only after obtaining parental permission to do so), Milk will collect only such information as is necessary for the intended purpose. Milk will not provide any personally identifying information whatsoever from our guests under 13 years of age to any third party for any purpose without consent of a parent or guardian. In addition, Milk will provide a secure Web page that allows parents to view, revise and/or delete all information gathered about their children; to consent to Milk's collection and use of such information; and to consent to disclosure of such information to third parties. Links to that page will be prominently displayed on the whymilk.com homepage, within this Privacy Policy, on all pages where information is gathered on the site, and in emails sent to parents to confirm permission to collect user data.
</p>
<p>
Guests under 13 years of age may participate in activities on our site upon registration (such as entry in a sweepstakes), unless a parent or guardian invalidates their registration. When a guest under 13 registers for a sweepstakes or contest, he/she will be required either to: (a) provide the e-mail address of a parent or guardian who will then receive an e-mail alert regarding his/her child's attempted registration, or (b) print the registration/entry form and mail it with a parent/guardian's signature. If such a guest wins, notification and prizes will be sent to the parent or guardian. Publication of names, ages, or likenesses of promotion winners under 13 requires parental or guardian consent.
</p>
<p>
Unsolicited requests for information on a one-time basis will be honored without parental consent, and any personal information used for purposes of responding will not be retained or used for any other purpose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>POLICY FOR TEENS (INDIVIDUALS 13 TO 17 YEARS OF AGE)</strong><br>
Guests who are 13 to 17 years of age should seek parental consent before providing any personal identifying information on our site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>USE OF IP ADDRESSES</strong><br>
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. Milk collects IP addresses for the purposes of system registration, to report aggregate information to our promotional partners, and to audit the use of our site.
</p>
<p>
When guests request pages from Milk sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers, or others.
</p>
<p>
<strong>USE OF COOKIES</strong><br>
The whymilk.com site uses cookie and tracking technology. Cookie and tracking technology is useful for gathering information such as browser type and operating system, tracking the number of visitors to the web site, and understanding how visitors use the site. Cookies can also help tailor the site to visitors' needs and help customize the site for visitors. For example, we may use cookies to make sure you don't see the same information repeatedly. Also, if you have elected to store your favorite recipes or activities at the site, cookies help us do this. The site may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and for other similar purposes. We use general IP address information to better understand how the site is utilized. Personal information cannot be collected via cookies and other tracking technology, however, if you previously provided personally identifiable information, cookies may be tied to such information. Aggregate (not individual), cookie and tracking information may be shared with third parties.
</p>
<p>
<strong>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</strong><br>
Users should be aware that when they are on Milk, they can be directed to other sites, the content and practices of which are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from Milk pages that take you outside our service. This includes links from partners that may use Milk or the Milk's logo as part of a co-branding agreement.
</p>
<p>
These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While Milk strives to protect their users' personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.
</p>
<p>
Milk's policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Milk's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>SECURITY</strong><br>
The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Milk can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
</p>
<p>
