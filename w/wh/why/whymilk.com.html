            <p align="left"><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b><br>
              This site ("Milk") has a policy to respect and protect the privacy 
              of its users. This privacy policy statement tells you how we collect 
              information from you and how we use it. Using the Internet should 
              be a fun experience and we want to help you make it so. </p>
            <p align="left">The information you provide to Milk will not be disclosed 
              to third parties without your consent. Milk may share aggregate 
              information about our users with advertisers, business partners, 
              sponsors, and other third parties (for example, what percentage 
              of our visitors are male and what percentage are female). This data 
              is used to customize the content and advertising on our site and 
              to deliver a better experience for our users. </p>
            <p align="left">There are cases where Milk may request personal information 
              such as your name, e-mail address and birth date. For example, we 
              request personal information when you request information, brochures 
              or information on diet and exercise, or for services that require 
              registration (for example, entrance in a sweepstakes or joining 
              Club Milk).</p>
            <p align="left"> Milk needs to collect this information for complying 
              with your requests, fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying compliance 
              with Milk policies as well as federal, state, and local laws, and/or 
              for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes. We will not use 
              any personal information for any purpose except for its intended 
              use, which shall be disclosed at the time such information is requested.

            <p align="left"><b>OPTING OUT </b><br>
              Information provided at the time of registration or submission from 
              a guest who is 13 years of age or over may be used for marketing 
              and promotional purposes by Milk. To keep you in control of your 
              personal information and the communications directed to you, you 
              may opt out of receiving communications from Milk about new features 
              or services. If you object to such use for any reason, you may stop 
              that use by e-mail request to milk@bsmg.com. To opt out of receiving 
              information from www.gotmilk.com, please refer to the California 
              Fluid Milk Processor Advisory Board's privacy policy.</p>
            <p align="left"><b>POLICY FOR KIDS (INDIVIDUALS UNDER 13 YEARS OF 
              AGE) </b><br>
              Milk encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with 
              their children and to participate in the activities offered on the 
              sites. No information should be submitted to or posted at Milk by 
              guests under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent 
              or guardian. Unless otherwise disclosed during collection and parental/guardian 
              consent is obtained, Milk does not provide any personally identifying 
              information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any 
              purpose whatsoever from our guests under 13 years of age.</p>
            <p align="left">When a guest under 13 registers for a sweepstakes, 
              contest or Club Milk, he/she will be required either to: (a) provide 
              the e-mail address of his/her parent or guardian and that parent 
              or guardian will receive an e-mail alerting them to that registration, 
              or (b) print the registration/entry form and mail it in with a parent/guardian 
              signature. </p>
            <p align="left">Unsolicited requests for information on a one-time 
              basis will be honored without parental consent, and any personal 
              information used for purposes of responding will not be retained 
              or used for any other purpose. Registered guests under 13 years 
              of age may participate in activities on our site upon registration 
              (such as participation in Club Milk or entry into a sweepstakes), 
              unless their parent or guardian asks that their registration be 
              invalidated.</p>
            <p align="left"> In order for the potential member to use the Milk 
              interactive services, the parent or guardian must validate the account, 
              as described in the e-mail. No information collected from guests 
              under 13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes 
              whatsoever, either inside or outside Milk, except as explicitly 
              stated during registration for contests or promotions (and in that 
              case, the information collected is used only for the specific contest 
              or promotion). </p>
            <p align="left">Although guests under 13 years of age may be allowed 
              to participate in some contests and promotions, if such a guest 
              wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parent or guardian 
              identified in the initial registration process. Publication of names, 
              ages, or images for promotion winners under 13 require parental 
              or guardian consent.</p>
            <p align="left"> <b>POLICY FOR TEENS (INDIVIDUALS 13 TO 17 YEARS OF 
              AGE) </b><br>
              Guests who are 13 to 17 years of age should seek parental consent 
              before providing any personal identifying information on our site.</p>
            <p align="left"> <b>USE OF IP ADDRESSES</b> <br>
              An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your 
              computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big 
              computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify your 
              computer by its IP address. Milk collects IP addresses for the purposes 
              of system administration, to report aggregate information to our 
              promotional partners, and to audit the use of our site. </p>
            <p align="left">When guests request pages from Milk sites, our servers 
              log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses 
              to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session 
              will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and 
              will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary 
              to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or 
              to protect our service, site, customers, or others. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>USE OF COOKIES</b> <br>
              What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site 
              transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. 
              Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences 
              while you're at our site. We never save passwords or credit card 
              information in cookies. </p>
            <p align="left">The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll 
              find them at most major Web sites. By showing how and when guests 
              use a site, cookies may help us see which areas are popular and 
              which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based 
              on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This 
              information is most easily tracked with cookies. We may use the 
              information from cookies to provide services better tailored to 
              our users needs. Milk has two primary uses for their cookies. </p>
            <p align="left">First, we may use them to specify unique preferences. 
              This way you don't have to tell us over and over again about the 
              kinds of information you want to see. Secondly, we use cookies to 
              track user trends and patterns. This helps us better understand 
              and improve areas of the Milk service that our users find valuable. 
              <br>
              While both of these activities depend on the use of a cookie, visitors 
              to Milk always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser 
              preferences.</p>
            <p align="left">Information from cookies is sometimes attached to 
              messages sent to our Customer Service department. Most browsers 
              are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser 
              to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, 
              note that some parts of the Milk service will not function properly 
              or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For example, 
              without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized news preferences 
              or you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, entering 
              contests, or playing games. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>LINKS TO OTHER SITES </b><br>
              Users should be aware that when they are on Milk, they could be 
              directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links 
              to other sites from Milk pages that take you outside our service. 
              For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement or wish to 
              purchase milk gear or gifts on www.gotmilk.com, the "click" takes 
              you off the Milk site. This includes links from advertisers and 
              partners that may use Milk or the Milk's logo as part of a co-branding 
              agreement.</p>
            <p align="left"> These other sites may send their own cookies to users, 
              collect data, or solicit personal information. Please keep in mind 
              that whenever you give out personal information online that information 
              can be collected and used by people you don't know. While Milk strives 
              to protect their users' personal information and privacy, we cannot 
              guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and 
              you do so at your own risk. </p>
            <p align="left">Milk's policy does not extend to anything that is 
              inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond 
              Milk's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary 
              to applicable law or governmental regulation.</p>
            <p align="left"> <b>SECURITY </b><br>
              The importance of security for all personally identifiable information 
              associated with our Guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise 
              great care in providing secure transmission of your information 
              from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission 
              over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, 
              while we strive to protect your personal information, Milk can't 
              ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to 
              us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your 
              own risk.</p>
            <p align="left">Once we receive your transmission, we make our best 
              effort to ensure its security on our systems. When credit card information 
              is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) 
              encryption. Your Milk Account is password-protected so that only 
              you can access it and view the member information relevant to the 
              account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. 
              Milk will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone 
              call or e-mail.</p>
            <p align="left">ltimately, you are responsible for maintaining the 
              secrecy of your passwords and any account information. Remember 
              to sign out of your Milk or Milk Account and close your browser 
              window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that 
              others cannot access your personal information and correspondence 
              if your computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer 
              with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like 
              a library or Internet café. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>UNSOLICITED MATERIALS </b><br>
              Please note that it is our policy not to accept or consider unsolicited 
              creative, production-related or other materials of any kind. We 
              appreciate your cooperation in adhering to this policy. </p>
