<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<div class="message">
<p class="stats">Last Revised: March 12, 2009</p>

<p>This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal information
is collected, used, and disclosed with respect to your use of our web
site located at www.whrrl.com (the "Site") and the software and services
provided by Pelago, Inc. ("Pelago", "we" or "us") and accessed through
the Site and your mobile device (the "Whrrl Service") so you can make an
informed decision about using the Whrrl Service. By using the Whrrl
Service, you represent that you are 13 years old or older and consent to
the privacy practices described in this Policy, as may be modified by us
from time to time. We reserve the right to change the provisions of this
Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by
indicating on the privacy policy the date it was last updated. Your use
of the Site following the posting of such changes or revised statement
shall constitute your consent to any changes in our privacy practices,
and you expressly waive any right to notice of such changes. We
encourage you to review this Policy whenever you visit our Site to make
sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will
be used.</p>

<p>Every place, event, and person on Whrrl has its own feed that
appears on its page. Only the activity it's directly related to will
appear for others to see. You won't be able to see notes on another
person's feed that you're not allowed to see. However, if you write a
review, post a note or comment, or upload pictures to a particular place
for your friends, what you say or do will appear in each of your Whrrld
Feeds as well as the feed of the place, so it's easy to stay up-to-date
with your friends and see their activities related to the places and
events they talk about.</p>

<h3>What is personal information?</h3>
<p>As used herein, the term "personal information" means information
that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address,
telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or other account
number), and information about that individual's location or activities,
such as information about his or her use of the Site or the Whrrl
Service, when directly linked to personally identifiable information.
Personal information also includes demographic information such as date
of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information
is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal
information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we
collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of
products, services or users, from which individual identities or other
personal information has been removed. In other words, information about
how you use a service may be collected and combined with information
about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us
understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider
new features or otherwise tailor our Site. This policy in no way
restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>

<h3>What personal information do we collect?</h3>
<p>Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when
you visit our Site or use the Whrrl Service. We may collect certain
information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal
information. For example, we may collect personal information, such as
your name, address, location, email, phone number, mobile number and
other contact and demographic information when you register and set up
an account, send us a text message or contact us by e-mail or other
means for any reason. Personal information may also be collected if you
provide such information in connection with creating a profile, leaving
comments, posting content, sending an email or message to another user
or participating in any interactive forums or features on the site. In
addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other
personal information you provide in connection with your participation
in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other
activities on the Site or through the Whrrl Service.</p>
<p>If you opt in to the SMS service or use a Whrrl application on
your mobile device, the Whrrl Service may also automatically collect
location information from your mobile device or your mobile carrier.
However, your location data will only be shared with other users when
you choose to provide the information to the Whrrl Service, and in
accordance with this policy and with applicable privacy settings.</p>
<p>When you use the Whrrl Service, whether via our web site or your
mobile device, some information is also automatically collected, such as
your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser
type, the address of a referring web site, and your activity on the
Site. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it
with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above.
Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only. We may also automatically
collect certain information through the use of "cookies." Cookies are
small data files that are stored on a user's hard drive at the request
of a Web site to enable the site to recognize users who have previously
visited them and retain certain information such as customer preferences
and history. If we combine cookies with or link them to any of the
personally identifying information, we would treat this information as
personal information. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of
cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to
learn about these functions. However, if a browser is set not to accept
cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, you will not be able to sign in
and will not be able to access certain Site features or services.</p>

<h3>How do we use the personal information we collect?</h3>
<p>In general, we use personal information we collect to process
your requests or transactions, to provide you with information or
services you request, to inform you about other information, events,
promotions, products or services we think will be of interest to you, to
facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of, the
Site and the Whrrl Service, and for the purpose for which the
information was provided. For example, we may use the information we
collect:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>to send you a welcoming email or text message and to contact you
	about your use of the Site and the Whrrl Service, such as for
	administrative purposes, to provide you with customer service or to
	facilitate your registration for or participation in certain features
	of the Whrrl Service;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>to provide you with all of the services, features, and
	functionality included within the Whrrl Service, to provide other
	services, products or information you request and to complete any
	transactions in connection therewith;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>to respond to your emails, submissions, comments, requests or
	complaints;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>to request feedback and to enable us to develop, customize and
	improve the Site and our publications, products and services;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>to contact you about our or a third party's services, products,
	activities, special events or offers and for other marketing,
	informational, product development and promotional purposes;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>to notify contest winners; and</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>for the specific purpose for which the information was provided.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Personal information provided online may be linked together or
merged with other personal information so that we may better understand
your needs and inform you about our products or services and those of
our partners. In addition, if we receive information from third parties
with whom we have business relationships, we may combine this
information with the other personal information we maintain about you.
In either case, this Policy governs this information.</p>

<h3>Sharing of personal information</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Pelago will not share your personally
identifiable information with other, third-party companies for their
commercial or marketing use without your express consent.</p>
<p>If you choose to provide personally identifying information to
us, we may use and disclose it as described in this Privacy Policy (and
in any updates to this policy that may be posted to the Site from time
to time). We may share personal information with third party vendors,
consultants and other service providers (Service Providers) who are
engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the
Site and the Whrrl Service and who need access to such information to
carry out their work for us. In some cases, the Service Provider may be
directly collecting the information from you on our behalf. For example,
we may use a third party service to route and process cell phone
messages you send to the Whrrl Service. We inform our Service Providers
that any such information we provide may only be used to carry out their
work for us. However, we are not responsible for the actions of such
Service Providers, nor are we responsible for any additional information
you provide directly to these Service Providers or to other third
parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices
before disclosing information directly to them. Note that nothing herein
restricts the sharing of aggregate information, which may be shared with
third parties without your consent.</p>
<p>You understand that when you use the Whrrl Service, certain
information you post on the Site or provide through the Whrrl Service
may be shared with other users and posted on publicly available portions
of the Site, including without limitation your profile, comments,
photographs and locations. In addition, you understand that use of the
Whrrl Service includes the disclosure and display of your Location Data
to other users, your wireless carrier, and third-party partners. You may
elect to restrict user access to certain information to those you have
accepted as "friends" by using the available privacy settings. Please be
aware, however, that although we endeavor to use commercially reasonable
efforts to implement these restrictions and honor these designations, no
system or security measure is perfect or impenetrable, and therefore, we
cannot guarantee that this information will not be available to others.
In addition, regardless of the setting you select for your own profile,
you should be aware that (i) Location Data and other personal
information that you post on other users' profiles or other areas of the
Site or the Whrrl Service that are not designated as private may be
publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone; and (ii)
personal information and Location Data may still be shared with
carriers, Service Providers and other third parties in accordance with
the provisions of this Policy. Your use of the Whrrl Service constitutes
your consent to share this information in such manner and all such
sharing of information is done at your own risk. Please keep in mind
that if you directly disclose personal information when posting comments
or other information or content to the Site or through the Whrrl
Service, this information may become publicly available and may be
collected and used by others. We recommend you be cautious in giving out
personal information to others in public online forums. We also
recommend that you periodically review your privacy settings to ensure
that they reflect your preferences.</p>
<p>In addition, we may disclose personal information in the good
faith belief that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so, or
that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the
law or with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to
protect the rights, property or safety of Pelago, our users, our
employees or the public, including without limitation to protect Pelago
or our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of
our Site or the Whrrl Service. Information about our users, including
personal information, may also be disclosed or transferred as part of,
or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing
or acquisition or in any other situation where personal information may
be transferred as one of the business assets of Pelago.</p>

<h3>What steps do we take to protect personal information online?</h3>
<p>We have endeavored to put into place reasonable security measures
in an effort to protect personal information while it is under our
control. Your account information is accessible online only through the
use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of personal
information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose
it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of our web site
by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you
believe your password has been misused.</p>

<h3>What choices do you have regarding the use of your personal
information?</h3>
<p>In order to use the SMS interface for the Whrrl Service (the "SMS
Service"), you must provide us with certain personal information and
give us the right to send you messages and communications via SMS, text
message, email or other electronic means to your mobile device,
including third party promotions and ads, and otherwise use such
personal information as described in this Policy. If you do not wish to
receive further communications from us to your mobile device, then you
may opt out of the SMS Service by sending the text <span class="sms">STOP</span>
to the Whrrl service from the cell phone, by disabling this feature in
the user profile settings on <a href="http://www.whrrl.com">www.whrrl.com</a>,
or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:help@whrrl.com">help@whrrl.com</a>.
If you are not using the SMS Service, you may "opt out" of receiving
marketing or promotional communications from us by so indicating at the
time of registration, by disabling this feature in the user profile
settings on <a href="http://www.whrrl.com">www.whrrl.com</a> or by
emailing us at <a href="mailto:help@whrrl.com">help@whrrl.com</a>. You
may at any time withdraw your consent to the use and disclosure of your
location data. However, such withdrawal will prevent you from using
certain features of the Whrrl Service, such as posting reviews, creating
friends lists, or interacting with other users.</p>

<h3>Collection of information from children under 13</h3>
<p>The Whrrl Service is not intended for use by children under 13,
and you must be 13 or older to create an account. By registering for the
Whrrl Service or using the Site, users represent to us that they are 13

attempt to create an account and do not provide any personal information
on our Site or through our Whrrl Service.</p>

<h3>Users outside the United States</h3>
<p>All the data we collect is stored in the United States. If you
use the Whrrl Service from outside the US and provide personal
information to us, your personal information will be transferred to the
United States. Through your use of the Whrrl Service, you consent to
such transfer and to the use of the information in the United States.
</p><h3>Links to other web sites</h3>
<p>Our web site contains links to other web sites. Any personal
information you provide on the linked pages is provided directly to that
third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. We are
not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and
policies of web sites to which we link. Links from our web site to third
parties or to other sites are provided for your convenience. We
encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and
