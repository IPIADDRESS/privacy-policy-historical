<p>Welcome to this Corporate Website. This site is owned by Wolters Kluwer nv. This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide via this site.<br><br>Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information to this site. This site is governed by applicable Dutch laws. Use of this site constitutes your consent to application of such laws and regulations and to our Privacy Policy.<br><br></p>
<h4>Your Consent</h4>
<p>By using this site, you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information via this site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br><br></p>
<h4>Active Information Collection</h4>
<p>Like many web sites, this site actively collects information from its visitors both by asking you specific questions and by permitting you to communicate directly with us via e-mail.<br><br>Some of the information that you submit may be personally identifiable information (that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you such as your full name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and so on).<br><br>Some areas of this site may require you to submit information in order for you to benefit from the specified features (such as e-mail alerts or newsletter subscriptions). You will be informed at each information collection point what information is required and what for.<br><br></p>
<h4>Passive Information Collection</h4>
<p>As you navigate through a Web site, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags and navigational data collection.<br><br>This site uses Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non- personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer). We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our site, and administer and improve the site.<br><br>A "cookie" is a bit of information that a Web site sends to your Web browser that helps the site remember information about you and your preferences.<br><br>"Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your Web browser window or otherwise turn your computer off. Session cookies are used to improve navigation on Web sites and to collect&nbsp; aggregate statistical information.<br><br>"Persistent" cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (e.g., passwords), helping to determine what areas of the Web site visitors find most valuable, and customizing the Web site based on your preferences. This site uses cookies mainly to store your default preferences.<br><br>You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.<br><br>You can also set your browser to block the placing of cookies at all, but you should realize that this can limit the use of our website or services. You can find more information about cookies at&nbsp; <a class="text-link" href="http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq" target="_blank">www.cookiecentral.com/faq</a><br><br>Except as otherwise stated, we may use your information to improve the content of our site, to customize the site to your preferences, to communicate information to you (if you have requested it), for our marketing and research purposes, and for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose your personally identifiable information where required by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations.<br><br><a href="#top">Back to top</a><br><br><strong>E-mail address<br></strong>If you subscribe to our e-mail alerts, we collect your e-mail address. This address will only be used for keeping you informed as indicated. If you wish to unsubscribe from our e-mail alert list, you can do so at any moment as indicated in every e-mail you receive or by contacting us through <a class="text-link" href="mailto:info@wolterskluwer.com.">info@wolterskluwer.com.</a><br><br></p>
<h4>Access and Correction</h4>
<p>To keep your personally identifiable information accurate, current, and complete, please contact us as about any incorrect information. We will update or correct personally identifiable information in our possession that you have previously submitted via this site.<br><br></p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>We take reasonable steps to protect your personally identifiable information as you transmit your information from your computer to our site and to protect such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever 100% secure or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from this site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Moreover, where you use passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features on this site, it is your responsibility to safeguard them.<br><br></p>
<h4>Links to Other Web Sites</h4>
<p>This site may contain links or references to other web sites. Please be aware that we do not control other web sites and that, in any case, this Privacy Policy does not apply to those web sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of every web site you visit.<br><br><strong>Changes<br></strong>Wolters Kluwer may revise this Privacy Policy. You agree to be bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically visit this page to determine the current terms to which you are bound.<br><br></p></span>
