<p>When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mail from Rodale, we may use web beacons (described below), customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information.</p>

<strong>Transfers of Information for Legal Purposes</strong>
<p>Rodale Inc. may need to disclose certain information to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, or search warrant, in the course of a legal proceeding or in response to a law enforcement agency request. If there is a change of control in Rodale's business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise) or a sale or transfer of its assets, customer information could be sold or transferred as part of that transaction and your PII potentially used by the Purchaser or other recipient of said customer information.</p>

<p>You acknowledge that Rodale is located in the United States of America ("U.S.") and will process and store your information in the U.S., and that as a result, U.S. governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the laws of the U.S.</p>

<strong id="chapter4">Mobile Devices/Third Party Fees</strong>
<p>From time to time, Rodale may deploy mobile marketing campaigns and may allow you to register for services that involve messages and/or e-mails being sent to your mobile device. You are responsible for obtaining access to the mobile device services and that access may involve third-party fees, including mobile carrier, text messaging, or airtime charges. You are solely responsible for those fees, including any and all fees associated with the delivery of the messages, e-mails or other materials to your mobile device. Please consult your mobile service provider's pricing plan prior to registering for any such service to determine the charges for sending and receiving text messages from/to your mobile device. You will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving text messages or emails to your mobile device at the time you register and with each message or email you receive.</p>

<p>Mobile marketing campaigns may involve your sending an e-mail from your mobile device to Rodale or a third-party campaign operator. An e-mail or other response will then be sent to your mobile device. Opting to participate in a campaign is 100% your choice. When you engage in these mobile marketing campaigns, Rodale and the third-party campaign operator collect your cell phone number, the name of your wireless service provider, images that you send using your cell phone as part of the campaign, and other relevant information.</p>

<strong id="chapter5">What are "cookies" and what do they do for me?</strong>
<p>In order to provide better service when you return to our site, Rodale may use cookies to store your preferences and information about such things as items added to your shopping cart, purchases you have made with us, what pages you visit, and past activity at a site. "Cookies" are tiny pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are also used to ensure that you are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads and to customize Webpage content based on your browser type (Netscape or Microsoft Explorer, for example). Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.</p>

<p>If you want to disable cookies, there is a simple procedure in most Internet browsers that allows you to turn off cookies. Please remember, however, that cookies may be required to allow you to use certain features of our sites.</p>

<p>We may also use third-party advertising, data analytics and online targeting companies to serve ads when you visit the Sites. When online advertisements are displayed to you, one or more persistent cookies may be placed on your computer. Some of these companies may use anonymous information (not including PII) about your visits to this Site and other websites in order to provide data and targeting recommendations based on which we may provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. To learn more about this practice and the third party companies we currently might be using, click <a href="http://www.rodaleinc.com/third-party-advertising" target="_blank">here</a>.  To opt-out of this practice please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

<strong id="chapter5a">Use of Web Beacons</strong>
<p>Rodale Website pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to assist in delivering cookies on our sites and allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.</p>

<p>Rodale may also employ Web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations of our sites.</p>

<strong id="chapter5b">Links</strong>
<p>Rodale sites may, on occasion, contain links to other sites with information gathering practices different from our own. Visitors should consult privacy policies for all other sites, as Rodale has no control over information submitted to or collected by such third parties.</p>

<p>Rodale sites sometimes offer contest, sweepstakes, or promotions sponsored or co-sponsored by third parties. These third parties may obtain PII that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. Rodale has no control over the third-party sponsor's use of this information. The Rodale site will notify you at the time of requesting PII if third-party sponsors will be provided with such information.</p>

<strong id="chapter6">Changes...</strong>
<p>Rodale may need to change this privacy policy from time to time in order to address new issues, evolving technologies, changes on our sites, or business practices. Rodale will post those changes so you will always know what information we gather and how we might use that information. Please refer back to this policy regularly.</p>
