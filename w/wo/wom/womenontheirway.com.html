<h2>Wyndham Worldwide Internet Customer Privacy &amp; Information Practices Policy</h2>
<p><strong>Wyndham Worldwide Corporation</strong> ("<strong>Wyndham</strong>") recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of certain Information collected about the users and visitors ("<strong>user</strong>," "<strong>you</strong>" <strong>or</strong> "<strong>your</strong>") of Wyndham's Web site ("<strong>Web Site</strong>"). The following privacy and information practices policy discloses and describes what Information Wyndham may gather about you, how Wyndham may use such Information, and how you can correct or change such Information ("<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>"). This Privacy Policy is designed to give you an understanding about how Wyndham collects your Information and the uses Wyndham may make of such Information during the course of Wyndham's business and in providing you with access to the information, products and services that may be available at this Web Site.</p>

<p>You should print a copy of this Privacy Policy for your records. Please note, however, that Wyndham may update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time   as Wyndham deems necessary in its sole discretion. Certain capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy may be defined in Wyndham's separate <a href="/terms-and-conditions" title="Web Site Terms of Use">Web Site Terms of Use</a>.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Wyndham's purpose in establishing this Privacy Policy is to balance its legitimate business interests in collecting and using its users' Information   with its users' reasonable expectations of privacy. Wyndham's intent is to   provide to you certain offers, information, services and discounts that it believes are relevant to your interests. Wyndham believes that its users will   benefit from promotional activity based on certain information employed to   market goods and services offered by and through its businesses.</p>

<h3>Affiliate Web Sites</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to this Web Site only. Please note that, to the extent that this Web Site permits you to link to other Web sites of Wyndham's   affiliated or related entities, or its Providers, separate privacy policies may   apply to those linked Web sites, which separate privacy policies may contain   different terms that are not the same as those terms contained in Wyndham's   Privacy Policy. <strong>Your access to and use of such linked Web sites through   links provided on this Web Site are not governed by this Privacy Policy but,   instead, are governed by the privacy policies of those linked Web sites, and   Wyndham disclaims any and all responsibility for your access to and use of such   linked Web sites, as well as for any use of the Information that you may provide   to, or any Information that may be collected about you at, such linked Web   sites.</strong></p>

<h3>What Information Does Wyndham Collect?</h3>

<p>Wyndham gathers the following three types of Information about its users: (1) data that users provide through optional, voluntary registration on Wyndham's   Web Site; (2) data that Wyndham gathers from third party sources or Providers;   and (3) data that Wyndham gathers through aggregated anonymous tracking of use   activity and usage trends, mainly by tallying Web pages that are viewed by users   throughout this Web Site. You should be assured, however, that Wyndham will not   disclose any of your Personal Information (as defined below) to third parties   without your consent, except as may otherwise be described in this Privacy   Policy or disclosed to you when you submit the Personal Information.</p>

<h3>How Does Wyndham Collect Information?</h3>
<h4>Optional Registration:</h4>
<p>Wyndham collects Information by specifically requesting it from you.   Generally this occurs when you register at the Web Site or request information   or a service. You may elect, at your sole option, whether to provide the   requested Information, although you may not be able to use or gain access to   certain portions or features of this Web Site if you elect not to provide such   Information. Usually, Wyndham and/or its business partners use your Information   to operate the Web Site and to deliver information and services to you. Wyndham   also uses your Information to inform you about other products and/or services   available from Wyndham, its affiliated or related entities, and/or its   Providers.</p>

<h4>Information from Third Party Sources:</h4>
<p>Wyndham may collect information about you from third party sources to   supplement the Information otherwise provided by you at this Web Site. This   supplemental information allows Wyndham to verify Information that you have   provided to Wyndham and to enhance Wyndham's ability to provide you with   information about its businesses, products and services, as further described in   Wyndham's Web Site Terms. Wyndham's agreements with these third party sources   typically limit how Wyndham may use this supplemental information.</p>

<h4>Use of Aggregate Tracking Information:</h4>

<p>Use of Internet Protocol ("<strong>IP</strong>") Addresses. </p>
<p>An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your   computer whenever you are surfing or browsing the Internet so that your computer   can be identified by the main computers, known as "Web servers," that "serve up"   Web sites and Web pages. This IP address allows Wyndham to identify and gather   general information and data about users, such as the Web pages that users may   view.</p>
<p>Wyndham collects IP addresses for the following purposes: (1) helping Wyndham   diagnose and resolve problems with its main computers; (2) administering its   systems and this Web Site; (3) reporting aggregated anonymous information to its   business partners and Providers; and (4) auditing the use of this Web Site. When   users request Web pages from this Web Site, Wyndham's Web servers log the user's   IP address. Wyndham does not normally link IP addresses to any Personal   Information, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user will   remain anonymous to Wyndham. For example, Wyndham collects and/or tracks the   home server domain name, the type of computer, and the type of Web browser used   by you to access this Web Site. Such collection and tracking information is   gathered by Wyndham as you navigate through this Web Site and the various Web   Site pages, and shall be used by Wyndham for its business purposes only, as   described above in this section.</p>
<p>Wyndham can, and will, use IP addresses to identify you when Wyndham feels it   is necessary to enforce compliance with its Web Site Terms and/or this Privacy   Policy, or to protect its services, Web Site, systems, information, employees,   business partners, Providers, users, customers or others. </p>

<h4>Use Of Cookies:</h4>
<p>Wyndham may place "cookies" on your web browser. Cookies are small pieces of   information or text files that a Web site sends to your computer for   record-keeping purposes, which information is stored in a file on your   computer's hard drive. Cookies make Web surfing and browsing easier for you by   saving your preferences so that Wyndham can use the saved information to   facilitate your use of, and improve your experience with, this Web Site when you   navigate at or return to this Web Site. Cookies, by themselves, do not provide   Wyndham with your individual identity or Personal Information unless you have   chosen separately to provide it to Wyndham. Wyndham never saves passwords or   credit card information in its cookies. The use of cookies is industry-standard   and, as such, you will find that most major Web sites use them.</p>
<p>By showing, tracking or recording how and when users use this Web Site,   cookies help Wyndham see which areas of the Web Site are popular and which are   not. Many of Wyndham's improvements and updates to the Web Site and enhancements   to the user experiences are based on the data and information compiled from   these cookies in conjunction with the total number of users of, and Web pages   viewed at, this Web Site. This data and information are most easily tracked with   cookies.</p>

<p>Most cookies expire after a defined period of time, or you can delete or   disable your cookie file(s) at any time. Most Web browsers are initially set up   to accept cookies. You can reset your Web browser to refuse cookies or to   indicate when a cookie is being sent. You should note that some parts or   features of Wyndham's Web Site or services may not function properly or be   accessible, or may be considerably slower, if you delete or refuse to accept   cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set certain   personalized preferences, and/or may have difficulty completing marketing or   other Web Site transactions. </p>
<p>Wyndham has two (2) primary uses for cookies. First, Wyndham uses cookies to   identify and specify a user's preferences. Second, Wyndham uses cookies to track   Web Site usage trends and patterns. This helps Wyndham to obtain a better   understanding of its users' needs and to improve areas of this Web Site. While   both of these uses and related activities are dependent upon the use of cookies,   you have the option, as described above, of disabling, deleting or refusing the   cookies via your Web browser preferences or similar features. </p>
<p>In addition, you may occasionally receive cookies from Wyndham's business   partners or Providers, or when you link to other third party Web sites. Wyndham   does not control these cookies, and disclaims any responsibility relating to the   use or receipt of such cookies. You should note that the use of advertising   cookies sent by third party Web servers is a standard practice in the Internet   industry. </p>
<p>Use of Pixels.</p>
<p>Wyndham and its third party ad servers may also use invisible pixels or Web   beacons on this Web Site to count how many users visit certain Web pages.   Information collected from invisible pixels or Web beacons is used and reported   in the aggregate without the use of Personal Information. This information may   be used to improve marketing programs and Content, and to target Wyndham's   Internet advertisements at this Web Site and/or other web sites.</p>

<h4>With Whom Does Wyndham Share Information?</h4>
<p>As a general rule, Wyndham will not share with or disclose to any third   parties any specific personally identifiable information about you that you may   submit or provide to Wyndham via this Web Site ("<strong>Personal   Information</strong>"), in a manner that connects you with the Personal   Information, except (a) as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, (b) when   Wyndham has your permission, or (c) under special circumstances, such as when   Wyndham believes in good faith that the law requires such disclosure or under   the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the ways that   your Personal Information may be disclosed:</p>

<p>Affiliates: Wyndham may share any or all of your Personal Information with   and among its affiliated or related entities or family of companies. This is   typically done so as to allow such entities and companies to offer to you   information about their respective businesses, products and services that they   believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors: Wyndham may disclose some or all of your   Personal Information to third party business partners or sponsors, as described   elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. In the event and to the extent that there are   additional uses of your Personal Information by Wyndham's business partners or   sponsors (which additional uses are not otherwise described in or contemplated   by this Policy), any such additional uses will be specifically described to you   prior to or at the time such Personal Information is collected or prior to any   transfer of such Personal Information to the business partners or sponsors. Many   promotions offer opportunities for you to request additional information from   such business partners and sponsors. By requesting additional information, you   signify your consent to Wyndham's transfer of your Personal Information to the   applicable business partners or sponsors so that they can respond to or fulfill   your request. Although, in many instances, only your e-mail address will be   shared with these business sponsors and partners, Wyndham is not limited to the   type of Personal Information that it may disclose, provided that you requested   the additional information and that Wyndham has otherwise complied with this   Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Third Party &amp; Aggregate Data: From time to time, you may be offered the   opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If you   opt to receive from these third parties information related to such materials or   offers, Wyndham will (with your permission) share your name and e-mail address   with such third parties. Under confidentiality agreements, Wyndham may match   Personal Information with data provided by these third parties. Also, as   described above in this Privacy Policy, Wyndham may keep track of which portions   of the Web Site users are visiting and other user statistics, and aggregate this   information to help Wyndham create a better experience for users of this Web   Site. This is all done without knowing your name or other Personal Information,   and allows Wyndham (in addition to other lawful purposes) to describe its users'   preferences, and the types of services in which the users may be interested, to   its business partners, advertisers, sponsors and other third parties. </p>
<p>Other: Wyndham may also disclose account information in special cases when it has reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify,   contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the Web Site   Terms or this Privacy Policy, or may be causing injury to or interference   (either intentionally or unintentionally) with any of Wyndham's rights or   property, other users, or anyone else. Wyndham may disclose or access account   information when it believes in good faith that the law requires it (and/or if   compelled to do so by law enforcement or government agencies, or by other legal   action), and for administrative and other purposes that it deems necessary to   maintain, service, and/or improve this Web Site or its products and services. </p>
<p>Careers with Wyndham: This Web Site may provide you the ability to search for job postings and/or submit applications for potential employment opportunities.   Wyndham may use third parties to collect and/or host these types of services or   related information. If a third party service provider is used for these   purposes, the third party provider is prohibited under agreement from using any   Personal Information that you may submit in conjunction with these services for   any purpose other than to collect and store such Personal Information on   Wyndham's behalf. The Personal Information that you submit for these purposes   will not be used for any purpose other than to allow you to search for job   postings, submit applications, or determine your qualifications for employment   with Wyndham or its affiliated or related entities.</p>
<p>Investor Center: This Web Site may allow you to subscribe to investor   newsletters, press releases, e-mail alerts, and other related communications.   The Personal Information that you may provide in conjunction with these   subscription services or offerings will be used only for the purpose of   providing you with such services or for responding to your subscription   requests.</p>
<p><strong>Children: This Web Site is not intended for use by children. Wyndham does not knowingly solicit or collect Personal Information from children under   the age of 13. If you are under the age of 18, you must obtain the consent of   your parent or guardian to use this Web Site</strong>.</p>

<h4>Opting Out; How Can You Control the Use of Information? </h4>
<p>In the event that you decide that you want to opt out from Wyndham's use of any Personal Information that you previously provided to (and/or authorized for   use by) Wyndham, or if any of your Personal Information (such as your zip code   or e-mail address) changes, Wyndham will use reasonable efforts to provide you   with a way to correct, update or remove such Personal Information. Wyndham makes   repeated efforts to verify the accuracy of your Personal Information and to   correct and update its databases based on the information available to Wyndham.   In the event that you believe that any Personal Information held by Wyndham is   inaccurate or outdated, Wyndham, upon notification and sufficient time for   verification, will take all reasonable steps to correct any inaccuracy or update   outdated Personal Information of which it is made aware. Wyndham also gives you   the opportunity to control or opt out from the communications that Wyndham   directs to you. If you wish to update or change your Personal Information or opt   out from any use or communication described in this Privacy Policy for any   reason, you may notify Wyndham of such update, change or opt out by   contacting:</p>

<h3>What Happens When You Link to a Third Party Site?</h3>
<p>You should be aware that, when you are on Wyndham's Web Site, you may be able   to hyperlink, or may be directed, to other third party Web sites that are beyond   Wyndham's control and/or outside of its services. For example, if you "click" on   a banner advertisement or a Wyndham search result, the "click" may transfer you   off of this Web Site and to another unaffiliated Web site. These other Web sites   may include sites of advertisers, sponsors, Providers and/or partners that may   use Wyndham's and/or Wyndham's affiliated or related entities' logos as part of   a co-branding agreement. These other Web sites may send their own cookies to, or   collect or solicit Information from, users. Wyndham does not control such third   parties or their Web sites, and, therefore, is not responsible for the contents   of these Web sites or the hyperlinks or advertising placed on such Web sites.   Wyndham's inclusion in this Web Site of hyperlinks to these other third party   Web sites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such other Web sites   or any association with the third party operators. This Privacy Policy does not   extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet and/or that   is beyond Wyndham's control. </p>
<p>Please keep in mind that, whenever you give out information over the Internet or Web, or otherwise in on-line environments, (for example, via message boards   or forums), such information can be collected and used by people you do not   know. While Wyndham strives to protect users' information and privacy, Wyndham   cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose in these   environments, and you disclose such information at your own risk. </p>

<h3>Is Your Information Secure?</h3>
<p>The security of all Information associated with users of this Web Site is an important concern to Wyndham. Wyndham exercises reasonable care in providing   secure transmission of your Information from your computer to Wyndham's servers   and databases. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be   guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Wyndham strives to protect your   Information, Wyndham cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Information   you transmit to Wyndham, and you do so at your own risk. Once you complete the   transmission of, and Wyndham receives, your Information, Wyndham uses industry   standard efforts and practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your Personal   Information, and uses commercially reasonable efforts to collect and secure such   Personal Information consistent with all applicable laws and regulations.   Wyndham takes commercially reasonable efforts to use a variety of different   security measures (such as encryption, digital certificates, firewalls and   Secure Socket Layers) designed to protect Personal Information from access by unauthorized users both inside and outside of Wyndham, and to protect against   the unauthorized or improper alteration or destruction of such Personal   Information. Wyndham's communication system, software and database practices   have been designed to aid in supporting authenticity, integrity and   confidentiality. However, as described above, "perfect security" does not exist   on the Internet and, despite these reasonable efforts by Wyndham to maintain   data and Information security, Wyndham cannot guarantee the security of data or   Information. </p>
