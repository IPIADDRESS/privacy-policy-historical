      <p>As a Licensed Professional Counselor, Mr. Grant is bound by a code of 
        ethics regarding clients confidentially. We will never sell your 
        information to any third party.  
In addition, we do not schedule appointments via email for these 
    reasons: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> The email might be sent to the wrong person, (with your name on it).<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Something in the email might be misconstrued (either by you or us) and 
            we don't want there to be any misunderstandings regarding appointment 
            times.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>There is a time gap between when you email and when we return your email 
            that makes accurate scheduling almost impossible.</li>
        </ul>

          understanding in this matter.<br>
