<h1>WOMF™ Privacy Policy</h1>
<ol>
	<li>WOMF Australia Pty Ltd &amp; WOMF Elert Pty Ltd and its licensors know and respect that you
	care how information about you is used and shared; WOMF Australia Pty Ltd &amp; WOMF Elert Pty Ltd
	appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly.</li>
	<li>By registering on the WOMF Australia Pty Ltd &amp; WOMF Elert Pty Ltd websites, you are
	accepting the Conditions and practices described.</li>
	<li>WOMF™ is an online application that helps people find local
	services they can trust by soliciting and aggregating reviews. To
	accomplish this, WOMF™ users write reviews about local services
	that are posted to the WOMF™ Site. These reviews can then be
	accessed and read by other WOMF™ users. For the purposes of this
	Privacy Policy, a "user" is defined as someone using the WOMF™
	Site, and a "friend" is defined as someone you have explicitly invited
	to share reviews with you.</li>
	<li>To fulfill the purpose of the WOMF™ Site, WOMF™ needs
	to display a limited amount of personal information, so that users are
	able to evaluate the trustworthiness of a particular review.</li>
	<li>By using WOMF™, you permit the collection and use of your
	personal information as outlined below in the Privacy Policy. You
	should visit this page periodically to review any changes to the
	Privacy Policy.</li>
	<li>When/if you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable
	information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) via reviews, messages,
	forums, postings, or in other areas of the WOMF™ site, that
	information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your
	communication, may be collected and correlated and used by third
	parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or
	third parties. These activities are beyond the control of WOMF™.
	Please do not post any personal information on the WOMF™ site or
	in other areas that you expect to keep private.</li>
	<li>As a registered WOMF™ user, you can modify your personal
	information at any time by accessing the "Registration" section of the
	site.</li>
	<li>Upon your request, WOMF™ will remove you and your personal
	information from the site; however, it may be impossible to remove your
	entry without some residual information being retained by WOMF™.
	Registered users who wish to delete their registration should do so
	through the local radio station website, hosting the WOMF™ site.
	</li>
	<li>Information WOMF Australia Pty Ltd &amp; WOMF Elert Pty Ltd collects:
