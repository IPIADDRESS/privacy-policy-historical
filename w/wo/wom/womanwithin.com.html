            <a name="twelve"><strong>Does Redcats USA Use Cookies?</strong></a><br>
Yes. Redcats USA uses cookies to enhance the browsing and shopping experience on the Redcats USA family of brands' websites. Cookies are small files or records that we place on your computer's hard drive to collect information about your activities on the Redcats USA sites. There are absolutely no personally identifiable pieces of information stored anywhere in these files, and they are used solely by Redcats USA to enhance your shopping experience and to allow us to serve you better in the future. These cookies transmit information back to the computers at Redcats USA's family of brands; these computers are, generally speaking, the only computers which are authorized to read such information. The information captured makes it possible for us (i) to speed navigation, keep track of items in your shopping cart, and provide you with custom tailored content; (ii) to remember information you gave to us so you don't have to reenter it each time you visit the Redcats USA sites; (iii) to monitor the effectiveness of some of our marketing email campaigns; and (iv) to monitor total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of visitors served.

Redcats USA uses Omniture and other service providers to help gather and analyze information about our customers (anonymous traffic, and from time to time, individual user activity) on our website.  These service providers' only role is to help us conduct our business and deliver the most relevant products and services.  They are not permitted to use your personally identifiable information for any secondary purpose.  
<br>
<br>
Most people do not even know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit the Redcats USA family of brands' sites or most other websites because web browsers are typically set to accept cookies. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie acceptance altogether. However, if you refuse cookies, you will be unable to order from the Redcats USA sites using the Shopping Cart. You will still be able to browse our selection, but the order process requires that your Web Browser be set to allow cookies. Moreover, by not allowing cookies, your overall Internet browsing experience could be adversely affected.

<a name="taxes"><strong>TAXES</strong></a><br>
We do not collect sales or use taxes in all states. For states imposing sales or use taxes, your purchase is subject to use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. Your purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over the Internet or by other remote means. Many states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return reporting all of the taxable purchases that were not taxed and to pay tax on those purchases. Details of how to file these returns may be found at the websites of your respective taxing authorities.

  <a name="termsint"><strong>Terms and Conditions for International Orders</strong></a><br>


<br>
<br>

When you place an order for delivery outside the United States, the Redcats USA <a href="">Privacy Policy</a> and Terms of Use posted on our website apply to you AS MODIFIED by these Terms and Conditions.<br>
<br>

<strong>Placing an Order</strong><br>
Redcats USA gladly accepts orders from all around the globe and can ship eligible products to certain countries so long as <strong>the billing address and "ship to" address are the same</strong>. Available product 
lines, shipping rates and fees may vary depending on the delivery address for your order.<br>
<br>

You will be notified at checkout if certain items must be removed due to weight, size (too large to ship in one package) or import/export laws and regulations. You must remove those items from your 
Shopping Bag before you can proceed to checkout.<br>
<br>

Your order will be completed by our shipping partner, I-PARCEL, who will convert our prices into your preferred currency, collect your payment information and estimate customs fees and import duties 
based on the country where your order will be delivered (the “destination country”). For international orders, your credit card information is only collected by I-PARCEL and is not shared with or 
collected by Redcats USA. See the Privacy Policy of <a href="http://www.i-parcel.com/safeharbor.aspx" target="_blank">I-PARCEL</a>. If required by the destination country, I-PARCEL or its agent may request additional personal identifying information that must be 
provided to complete the delivery. Such information will only be used for the purpose of processing your order. If you do not agree to these terms and do not provide the information, your order cannot be processed.
<br>
<br>
Once your order is complete, we will ship your order to I-PARCEL’s New Jersey location, and then I-PARCEL will ship the order to you. If we are not able to deliver your order, we will attempt to 
notify you of the problem using the email address you provided during checkout to notify you that your package has been deemed “undeliverable”. Please be sure your address and email information 
is correct during checkout. In the event that we cannot deliver your order (for example, an incomplete or wrong address) your order will be cancelled and we will refund the price of items you ordered. 
Shipping, handling and import fees and duties will not be refunded.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Customer Service</strong><br>
Email is the easiest way for our international customers to reach us. During our normal <a href="/Help/Help.aspx" target="_blank">business hours</a> you can reach customer service representatives who speak 
English and Spanish by calling +1 915 225 4971. 
Other languages are not supported at this time.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Sizes</strong><br>
International size charts are developed based on industry standards and subject to some variability within different garment types.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Import Duties, Customs Fees and Taxes</strong><br>
Your packages may be subject to customs fees and import duties imposed by the country where your package will be delivered (the “destination country”). These charges are always your responsibility. 
There is no free shipping and handling on international orders, even if such a promotion is available for orders inside the United States.
<br>
<br>
When you place an order for international delivery, you are the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the destination country. By placing your order, you authorize I-PARCEL, 
its employees and agents, to act as your agent with the customs and tax authorities in the destination country, to clear your merchandise, to process and remit your actual import fees for the items ordered. 
Even if you are ordering something you intend to give as a gift, by ordering, you authorize our shipping partner to act on behalf of the person who will receive the package, and the order must be shipped to your address
<br>
<br>
By placing your order you agree to allow I-PARCEL to collect estimated duties for the applicable items in your order. These funds will be used, on your behalf, to reimburse I-PARCEL’s carriers and agents 
for the import fees that they must pay on your behalf to the appropriate authorities of the destination country. It is possible that Customs clearance procedures can cause a shipment to be delivered beyond 
our original delivery estimates.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Payment Methods</strong><br>
Available payment methods will be by credit cards and/or through PayPal as displayed on your checkout page. Other options such as deferred billing, gift cards and e-gift cards available in the United States 
are not available for products shipped to destinations outside the United States.
<br>
<br>

Promotional Offering, Product and Shipping Restrictions<br>
International orders are not eligible for:<br>
<ul>
   <li> Free shipping</li><br>
    <li>Gift certificates, gift cards or e-gift cards</li><br>
   <li> Deferred billing</li><br>
   <li> Private label and co-branded credit cards</li><br>
   <li> Bra Club and OSP Shoppers Club</li><br>
</ul>
Certain brands and product lines may not be eligible for international shipping.<br>
<br>
<br>
Weight restrictions apply and orders may be restricted by size or quantity. Commercial purchases for retail sales are not permitted.<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Returns and Replacements</strong><br>

Customer Driven Returns: <strong>(Sales are final after 90 Days)</strong><br>
"Your Satisfaction is Guaranteed". If you received the correct item but, for any reason not related to quality, you're not satisfied with your purchase, simply return it within 90 days of receipt for a 
refund of the purchase amount. <strong>Returns will not be accepted after 90 days</strong>. We recommend that you use a return method that can be insured and tracked as we are not responsible for lost or damaged packages.
<br>
<br>

If you return a product to us, you will be the exporter from the destination country. You must comply with all the above regulations and requirements and pay applicable duties and taxes. <strong>Shipping and handling, 
return freight, duties and customs fees on the original shipment are not refundable.</strong> Additionally, you will be responsible for all shipping and handling, export and import fees associated with the return 
shipment back to our return center in the United States. Title and risk of loss are yours and only transfer to us when we receive the product at our fulfillment centers. For additional information, please contact us.
<br>
<br>


Returns Due to Problems: (Quality, Damage, Wrong Item) In the unlikely event we send you an item that has a quality issue, is damaged or is broken, <a href="/ContactUs/ContactUs.aspx">contact us</a>, or by calling +1 915 225 4971 to describe the problem.
<br>
<br>


<strong>Coupons and Special Offers</strong>
Promotions are usually limited to residents of the United States. Redcats USA will do its best to ensure that you are only offered promotions that apply to international shipments, so look for that notice on 
any coupon you may find. "Free Gift" and sale items may be subject to duties, taxes, and import fees. You will be responsible for these charges plus any shipping and handling incurred in getting the goods to 
the final destination.

Customs clearance procedures may cause delays beyond original delivery estimates.
<br>
<br>


<strong>Consent</strong>
By placing an order for delivery outside the United States, you are agreeing to these Terms and Conditions for International Orders and the Redcats USA Privacy Policy and Terms of Use as modified by
the Privacy Policy Modifications for International Shipment described below.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Privacy Policy Modifications for International Shipments</strong>
We value and protect your privacy as described in our <a href="/Help/PrivacySecurity.aspx#top">Privacy Policy</a>, and remind you that international shipments are subject to opening and inspection by customs authorities. When you submit 
information to us it is collected on a site that encrypts your information. When you send or receive emails about the status of your order using regular internet connections, those messages are
not encrypted and you should not include sensitive data such as a credit card number. If you contact us by phone, your call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance purposes.

<br>
<br>

We provide certain order, shipment, and product information to our international carriers, so they may discuss your order with customs authorities in order to obtain customs clearance and to comply with applicable laws.

<br>
<br>

Our Privacy Policy applies to all customers but the specific sections of our Privacy Policy listed below are modified for shipments outside the United States as follows:

<br>
<br>

<strong>What Information Does Redcats USA Collect?</strong><br>

    Some destinations require us to collect special import identification numbers prior to check out. This information is required to process your order through customs and deliver your order, and is 
    used only for that purpose.
    Redcats USA does not send catalogs or other mailings to international addresses that are not United States territories or possessions.
    Redcats USA does not collect credit card information related to international orders, and does not obtain information from other companies about your credit worthiness.
<br>
<br>
<strong>How Does Redcats USA Use the Information Collected?</strong>
<br>
    to notify you about other products or services that might be of interest to you, but only if you agree by checking the appropriate box during your checkout process (see also Third Party Advertising below)

<strong>What Information Is Shared And With Whom Is It Shared?</strong>

<br>
    to our logistics partner I-PARCEL, and I-PARCEL’s authorized international credit card company, in order to process your order and collect all billing and payment information from our international customers.
    Third Party Offers and Advertising: if you agree to receive email offers during the checkout process, you may receive special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. 
    See the <a href="/Help/PrivacySecurity.aspx#top">Privacy Policy</a> for instructions to remove yourself from any marketing emails that you receive.
    Redcats USA does not share your information with the bank that issues Redcats USA division credit card accounts (for which non-US residents are not eligible).
<br>
<br>

<strong>How Can I Opt Out of Receiving Further Communications from Redcats USA?</strong><br>
The section titled How to Be Removed from a Paper Catalog Mailing List does not apply since we do not send catalogs outside the United States.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Are Redcats USA Division Credit Cards Available?</strong><br>
Redcats USA Division Credit Cards are not available outside the United States.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Does Redcats USA Send Unsolicited Promotional Emails?</strong><br>
