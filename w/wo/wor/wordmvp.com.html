	<h1>Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy</h1>
	<p>This is the Word MVP site. The articles on this website have been contributed by a diverse multinational collection of volunteers.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>This page explains which data is collected from you when using this 
	website and how the data is used.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The privacy policy and cookie policy described on this page may be 
	amended from time to time by updating this page.</p>
	<p>Latest update: 14-May-2018.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Privacy policy</h2>
	<p>Personal information is any type of data that can be used to identify a person. This includes name, postal address, email address, phone number, IP address, localization data, payment information, browser history, etc.</p>
	<h3>No personal information is retained</h3>
   	<p>IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to 
	the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the 
	network to identify your computer. For each visitor to this website, the web server recognizes your IP
      address and the pages you request from it.&nbsp;This is part of the normal functioning
      of every web server, and necessary for it to return the pages you request.&nbsp;This
      information is not normally retained for longer than a few milliseconds.</p>
   
   <p>I do not normally run web server logging.&nbsp;However I might occasionally
      enable it for maintenance purposes, for a few hours or days. If I did,
      the above information might be written to a log file, which would then be
      automatically deleted at the end of the day or the end of the week.</p>
   <h3>Email addresses</h3>
   <p>I do not collect or store email addresses via this website.</p>
   
   <p>I will never send email to you except in response to an email from you.</p>
<h3>Postal mail</h3>
<p>I do not collect or store postal addresses via this website.&nbsp;I do not normally communicate
by post: I will not send, and are not likely to respond to, postal mail.
</p>
<h3>Telephone numbers</h3>
<p>I do not collect or store telephone numbers via this website.
   </p>

<h3>Accessing, removing or correcting Information</h3>
<p>I do not collect or store information from you, so I have no information to 
access, remove or correct.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>
	<p>This website uses cookies. Most websites do this. The cookies are not 
	used to identify you personally.</p>
	<h3>What are cookies?</h3>
    <p>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in 
	a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies.</p>
	<p>Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but 
	(to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. 
	A cookie cannot contain any harmful code.</p>
	<p>A cookie can be used to remember your actions and preferences (such as 
	login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of 
	time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to 
	the site or browse from one page to another.</p>
	<h3>How are cookies used on this website?</h3>
	<p>This website uses cookies:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>for statistical purposes, e.g. to count visitors and track how people 
	use the site in order to be able to best possible optimize how the site 
	works</li>
	<li>Some pages on this website contain a single ad placed by Google. Google 
	uses cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to the website or 
	other websites. Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a class="external" href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">
	Ads Settings</a>.</li>


	</ul>
	<h3>How to control cookies</h3>
	<p>You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – for details, see&nbsp;<a class="external" href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">aboutcookies.org</a>. 
	You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set 
	most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, 
	you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site 
	and some services and functionalities may not work.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Links to other websites</h2>
<p>This website contains links to other websites of interest. However, note that once you have used such link to leave this site, I do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, I cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide while visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement.
