			information on Luther Seminary Web sites. Luther Seminary also has 
			an internal Electronic Communications Policy which covers the use of 
			technology and information by students, faculty and staff. This 
			internal Electronic Communications Policy is available online at
			<a href="http://www.luthersem.edu/computer_services/policy.asp">
			http://www.luthersem.edu/computer_services/policy.asp</a>.</p>
			<p>Luther Seminary is fully committed to providing an engaging,

			these instances, Luther Seminary utilizes a secure server which 
			transmits and receives data in SSL-encrypted format.</p>
			<p>SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, a technology for managing 
			the security of online message transmission. SSL encrypts any 
			information sent from your browser to the server you are connected 
			to. This technology protects your information from being viewed by 
			an outside user.</p>

			in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or 
			alteration of information that we have collected from you at our 
			site.</p>

			enhanced online experience, enable e-commerce functionality and to
