In most cases, you may visit our Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself.  When you visit our Site, we collect and aggregate domain name information but we do not collect your e-mail address.  Like many Web sites you visit, we also use "cookies" (a small text file placed on your computer's hard drive), which allows you to access the contents of our Site faster and us to track statistical information about your use of our Site.  This "cookie" is not used to obtain your name or any personal data and is unable to execute any code or virus.  The information tracked through the use of cookies is used only for Works' internal purposes, such as to enrich your experience on our Site, and is not shared with anyone other than persons who assist us in these efforts and who are bound to confidentiality obligations.  If you would rather not accept cookies, you should be able to set your browser to reject them or to let you know before one is placed on your computer.</p>

Usually, we will only use your personal information to respond to an inquiry or request from you or to send you information about Works.  We restrict access to information about you to those employees of Works who need to know the information to respond to inquiries or requests from you or to send you information about Works.</p>
