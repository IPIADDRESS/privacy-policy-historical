<br><br>

<span class="DataInfo">
Columbus Publishing Ltd (CPL) is committed to protecting the privacy of the users of our websites and the overall integrity of the internet. To that end, we are disclosing here any issues related to privacy in the collection by CPL of personally identifiable information from users of our websites.<br><br>

We have adopted a set of information management guidelines that serve as the basis for our customer and advertiser relationships. These have been developed to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998. We take note of advice published from time to time by the Information Commissioner. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change and any such changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this page without notification. <br><br>

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to <a href="mailto:adsales@columbus-group.co.uk">adsales@columbus-group.co.uk</a><br><br>

For information on the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Information Commissioner please follow this link. <a href="www.dataprotection.gov.uk">www.dataprotection.gov.uk</a><br><br> 

A summary of the measures taken by CPL to protect our users' privacy is as follows:

<ul>

<li>We do not provide or sell your details to third parties unless you have specifically requested that we do so, in order that these advertisers and/or third parties can offer you information, goods and services that may be of interest to you. 

</li><li>We reserve the right to disclose information about member usage and demographics to advertisers and partners, but in anonymous aggregate form only. CPL will not reveal your personal identity in connection with the disclosure of such information. 

</li><li>We may contact users by email with updates about our website and its services. All our email correspondence includes an unsubscribe option. 

</li></ul>

<span class="DataTitle">What personally identifiable information do we collect about you?</span>
<br><br>
<span class="DataInfo">
We collect information on our users in two ways: through cookies, and through registration. For more information about cookies, please see below.<br><br>

We may require users to provide us with a name, email address, postal address, postcode, gender and date of birth in order to register for access to certain services. We may also ask for other non-mandatory demographic information from subscribers, including number of children and occupation. This information is stored by us and our data processors (see below).<br><br>

Following registration we will employ a registration cookie to recognise a subscriber and his or her access privileges on our websites, as well as to track site usage. <br><br>

We may also collect personal information from you through your use of enquiry and feedback forms and every time you email us your details.<br><br>

We also log IP addresses, or the location of your computer on the internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We occasionally use IP addresses to track a user's session, but do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information.
</span>
<br><br>

<span class="DataTitle">What do we do with the information collected?</span>
<br><br>
<span class="DataInfo">
We may perform statistical analyses of user behaviour in order to measure relative consumer interest in the various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or 'clicked' their advertising banners. In performing these statistical analyses, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form. Personal information on individual subscribers will not be provided to any third party if you object.<br><br>

We may periodically send you email updates on our websites and services offered by CPL and its advertisers. If you wish to opt out of receiving such information from us, please use the unsubscribe option included in all our email correspondence or send an email to <a href="mailto:adsales@columbus-group.co.uk">adsales@columbus-group.co.uk</a> stating that you would prefer not to receive such mailings.<br><br>

We will also use your information to target banner and box advertising on the site so you will see advertising that may be more relevant to you. You will never be targeted as an individual, but as a larger demographic group of similar users. This use of your personal information is contractual to the use of our websites. If you do not wish your information to be used in this way then you will be unable to use those areas of our websites that require registration.
</span>
<br><br>

<span class="DataTitle">With whom do we share the information we collect?</span>
<br><br>
<span class="DataInfo">
We will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others unless you have given us your permission. With your permission we will only share the information with carefully chosen, reputable and trustworthy third parties. Also, we may provide aggregate statistics on our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.<br><br>

We will provide subscribers a summary of all personal information that we process on them upon request. We will charge Â£50 for such requests. To make such a request, send an email to <a href="mailto:adsales@columbus-group.co.uk">adsales@columbus-group.co.uk</a> and include the email address that you registered with along with your full postal address and postcode.<br><br>

We are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of Web sites to which our sites may link.<br><br>

We may employ external companies to act on our behalf as data processors for internal business purposes. Data processors will abide by the Privacy Policy detailed here and will not disclose personal details to any other organisations or use data other than for purposes required by us. This use of your personal details is contractual to the use of our websites.

<br><br>
<span class="DataTitle">What is a cookie?</span>
<br><br>
<span class="DataInfo">
A cookie is a small, numeric text file that is stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Any information you provide to us is held securely on our web servers and not on your machine.
</span>
<br><br>

<span class="DataTitle">Why  do we use cookies?</span>
<br><br>
<span class="DataInfo">
Cookies make it possible for us to identify registered users without needing to ask for registration details every time you access one of our sites. Using cookies makes accessing our sites more convenient as you don't need to remember you username and password each time you enter.<br><br>

We may also use cookies to track registered or unregistered users as they travel through the site - for instance, we might use cookies to count the total number of unique users who are accessing the site over a particular period of time, or to ensure that you don't see a particular advert more than once. This information is only shared with third parties in aggregate form. The use of cookies in this way helps to make our systems more efficient.<br><br>

Opting to have an automatic login cookie on your computer's hard drive will allow you to bypass login screens, unless you have cookies disabled in your browser. Firewalls set up by your company network may prohibit the use of browser cookies.<br><br>
