<h5>Privacy Policy</h5>
<p class="h5align f08">
We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.
</p>
<h4 class="h5align">
(1) What information do we collect?
</h4>
<p class="h5align f08">
We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:
</p><ol class="h5align f08">
<li class="h5align">information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website (including your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit, number of page views and searches you make);</li>
<li class="h5align">information relating to any transactions carried out in this website, or in relation to this website, including information relating to any purchases or requests you make of third party's goods or services using this website; and</li>
<li class="h5align">any other information that you choose to send to us.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p class="h5align f08">
We also use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website.
These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies,

</p>
<h4 class="h5align">
(2) Cookies
</h4>
<p class="h5align f08">
A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. 
</p>
<p class="h5align f08">
We may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on the website.  We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the website; and keep you logged in. We will use the persistent cookies to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit; remember your preferred language; store the city that you were last interested in.
</p>
<p class="h5align f08">
Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.
</p>
<p class="h5align f08">
We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website.  Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers.  The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information.  Google's privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html.
</p>
<p class="h5align f08">
Our advertisers and/or payment services providers may also send you cookies.
</p>
<p class="h5align f08">
Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies.  (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector.)  This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites.
</p>
<h4 class="h5align">
