<h2>Work4 Privacy Policy</h2>
This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal and non-personal information collected by Work4 Labs, Inc.

</ul>
<h2>U.S.-EU Privacy Shield Statement</h2>
Work4 complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States, respectively. Work4 Labs, Inc has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield programs, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov. Work4 Labs, Inc. is committed to subjecting all personal data it receives from data exporters in any European Union (EU) or European Economic Areas (EEA) member states, under the Privacy Shield Framework, to its applicable Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework and the Privacy Shield Principles, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website at https://www.privacyshield.gov.
Work4 Labs, Inc. is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives from data exporters under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Work4 Labs, Inc. fully complies with the Privacy Shield Principles. The Company adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access and recourse, and enforcement and liability.

Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. Currently, we do not respond to “Do Not Track” browser features, but we may do so in the future as industry standards evolve.
<h2>Information Use</h2>
We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your prior explicit consent. We may use your personal information to contact you with your consent. If you do not wish to receive communications from us, you can opt out of receiving them through opt-out mechanisms included in those communications at any time.

<ul>

<ul>
<li>– To employers which have posted jobs for which you’ve expressed an interest or requested additional information;</li>

</ul>
<h2>Links</h2>
The Work4 Service may provide links to third-party websites for your convenience and information. If you access those links, you will leave the Work4 website. Work4 does not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from Work4’s. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites. The personal data you choose to give to unrelated third parties is not covered by the Work4 Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policy or any company before submitting your personal information. Some third- party companies may choose to share their personal data with Work4; that sharing is governed by that third-party company’s privacy policy. Work4 and Work4’s Customers share co-responsibility to uphold and honor the individual rights of natural persons over the treatment of personal data which have been collected concerning them.
<h2>Children</h2>
We do not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 16 years of age, and no part of the Work4 Service is directed to persons under the age of 16. If we learn that personally identifiable information of persons less than 16 years of age has been collected without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete such information.
<h2>Security</h2>
Work4 takes appropriate steps to ensure data privacy and security through various hardware and software methodologies. However, we cannot ensure or warrant against all risks with regards to the security of that information, so information you choose to transmit to Work4 and which we store is provided to us at your own risk, and Work4 does not guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our safeguards. In addition other Internet sites or services that may be accessible through Work4 have separate data and privacy practices independent of us, and therefore we disclaim any responsibility or liability for their security features, policies or actions.
In the case of a personal data breach, Work4 will notify the event to the relevant supervisory authority (the CNIL in France) no later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in conformity with the GDPR.
<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will post the changes on our website at www.work4labs.com and update the date of this Privacy Policy.
<h2>Contact Us</h2>
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, or if you want to remove any information you’ve posted in our blog or desire that we delete any testimonial, please contact us at: privacy@work4labs.com.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Work4 commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Work4 at: privacy@work4labs.com. For complaints that cannot be resolved between Work4 and the complainant, as well as for complaints concerning human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship, Work4 will cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs).
For Work4 personal user data requests under the GDPR, please contact us at: privacy@work4labs.com
