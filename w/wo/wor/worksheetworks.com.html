			<h4>Public Beta Preview</h4>
			<p>This website is currently in the late stages of its development, a state referred to as <i>beta</i>. As with all beta software, it has some quirks and many parts are not yet available. We are working hard to finalize the system's structure, and roughly once every two weeks we roll out new functionality towards this goal. Until then you may notice that some resources move or even disappear for a while.</p>
