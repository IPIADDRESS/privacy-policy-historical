These technologies, procedures and other measures are used in an effort to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you authorized to access your data. However, no internet, e-mail or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take care in deciding what information you send to us in this way. Workato is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.

<p>
We are based in the United States, but, unless we expressly agree otherwise (including through our Terms), we may host, transfer  and process data, including Personal Information, in the United States and in other countries through Workato and third parties that we use to operate and manage the Service. When you access or use the Service, or otherwise provide information to us, you are consenting, on behalf of you and your authorized agents, (and representing that you have the authority to provide such consent) to the processing and transfer of information in and to the United States and other countries which may have different privacy laws from your or their country of residence.
</p>
<h2 id="section-8">8. Choice</h2>
<p>
We process and store information on behalf of our customers. You may decline to submit any Personal Information through the Service, in which case we may not be able to provide certain services to you. Please refer to your mobile device or browser’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools. Note that disabling cookies on your mobile device or browser may prevent us or our business partners from tracking your browser’s activities in relation to the Service. However, doing so may disable many of the features available through the Service. If you are a Workato customer and would like to opt-out of getting marketing communications from Workato please contact us at privacy@workato.com or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in such marketing emails. Requests to opt-out of transfers to our third-party vendors may also be submitted, but limitations on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible to provide the Service after an opt-out.
</p>
<h2 id="section-9">9. Correcting and Updating Your Information</h2>
<p>
Customers may update or change the Personal Information they have provided Workato by logging into the Service and providing such additional information where applicable. If you are our customer and would like to gain access to, or request deletion of information we have collected as data controllers, please contact us at privacy@workato.com. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to such queries within 30 business days but are not liable for any failure to do so.
</p>
<p>
Workato has no direct relationship with the individuals, or companies with whom our customers may interact using the Service. Any such individual seeking access to, or who would like to correct, amend, or delete data which may be stored in the Service should direct his query to the applicable Workato customer acting as the data controller for such information.
</p>
<h2 id="section-10">10. Do Not Track</h2>

<h2 id="section-11">11. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
Workato will retain Personal Information we process on behalf of our customers or collect directly from our customers for as long as needed to provide Service to our customers, subject to our compliance with this Policy. We may further retain and use this Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, maintain accurate accounting, financial and other operational records, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We have established internal policies for the deletion of data from customer accounts following termination of a customer’s subscription to the Service.
</p>
<h2 id="section-12">12. Children's Personal Information</h2>
<p>
Workato does not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through our Service. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information on our Service without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to Workato through our Service, please contact us, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that information from our databases.
</p>
<h2 id="section-13">13. Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>
Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties.

<p>
We may, in our sole discretion, modify or update this Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Policy, we will endeavor to notify you by email or by posting a prominent notice on the Sites prior to the change becoming effective but will not be liable for any failure to do so. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to be bound by such changes to this Policy. Your only remedy, if you do not accept the terms of this Policy, is to discontinue use of the Service.
</p>
<h2 id="section-15">15. Business Transactions</h2>
<p>
Workato may assign or transfer this Policy, and your User account and related information and data, including any Personal Information, to any person or entity that acquires all or substantially all of the business, stock or assets of, or is merged with Workato. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions or similar transactions or proceedings, provided that the recipient of such information will continue to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.
