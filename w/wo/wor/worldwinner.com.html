        subsidiaries (collectively <strong>"GSN"</strong>), all mobile applications (each, an "<strong>App</strong>")
        operated by GSN, and the GSN "Community Features" (defined below) (unless a different policy is
        provided on a particular Website, App, or Community Feature in which case such different policy will control).
        The Website, Apps and Community Features are collectively referred to herein as the <strong>
            "Services"</strong>. This Privacy Policy discloses what type of information is collected on or
        through the Services, the methods used to collect it, how GSN utilizes the information and the choices you have
        about the way your information is collected and used. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of the
        Services indicates that you unconditionally accept the Privacy Policy. The Terms of Service are incorporated
        herein by reference. </p>
    <p></p><h4>1.<strong> </strong><u>Information</u><u> W</u><u>e</u><u> Collect</u></h4>
    <p>You can use some aspects of the Services at any time without providing any personally identifiable information ("<strong>PII</strong>")
        about yourself. PII may include your name, email address, phone number, home address, birth date, mobile phone
        number and credit card information. Providing your PII is voluntary. You can always choose not to provide PII,
        but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some of the Services. </p>
    <p>GSN strives to provide visitors, users and players with information relevant to their particular desires, needs
        and interests. The information we gather helps us to better serve this purpose. GSN actively and passively
        collects, uses and stores PII in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Registration to use or receive our Services or offers;</li>
        <li>Contest registration and prize acceptance;</li>
        <li>Creation of a personal profile;</li>
        <li>Downloading and using Apps may provide information about your location and your mobile device;</li>
        <li> Tracking and analyzing online and mobile data and activity through mechanisms that identify users, user
            preferences, site usage, browser types, IP addresses, and other data. Our collection and use of information
            is explained in greater detail over the next several sections of this Privacy Policy.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><u>GSN Account Information:</u></p>
    <p>In order to use certain Services, you may be required to register and create an account with GSN ("<strong>GSN
        Account</strong>"). There is no cost to create a GSN Account but you will be asked to choose a member name
        and password, and to provide certain PII, such as your real name, age, address, telephone number, occupation and
        e-mail address. Please note that your member name and city you reside in may be visible to other GSN customers
        depending on which Service you may be using. Once you have created a GSN Account, we may create an additional
        account for you on one or all of our affiliate websites. By registering for a GSN Account, you consent to the
        creation of these additional accounts. You can monitor and terminate any of these additional accounts by logging
        into your account. If you do provide GSN with PII, we will take all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect
        this information as more fully set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>We may also keep records of your transactions with us. We may use the information you provide to us in order to
        communicate with you about products purchased, related customer support and to send you information about other
        products or services we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
    <p>As part of the registration process to create a GSN Account or to participate in promotions, you may be asked to
        provide certain non-personal information. Non-personal information, alone, cannot identify you. GSN requests
        this non-personal information in order to enhance your experience of the Services by understanding you better
        and to make you aware of new services, programs or offers which may be of interest to you.</p>
    <p><u>Usage Information</u>:</p>
    <p>Like many other websites and apps, our Services may place small data files on your computer or other mobile
        device. These data files may be cookies, pixel tags, e-tags, or other local storage provided by your browser or
        Apps (collectively "<strong>Cookies</strong>"). GSN uses Cookies to enhance the user experience,
        customize content and advertising and to measure promotional effectiveness.</p>
    <p><u>Cookies</u>: We use Cookies to help us to identify account holders and to optimize their experience of our
        Services. We also use Cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of the Services. We use third
        party advertising companies (each, a "<strong>Third Party Advertiser</strong>") to market, sell, and
        display advertisements that you may see when you visit our Services. These Third Party Advertisers may use
        information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visit to the
        Services in connection with such marketing, sales, and advertising activities, including with respect to goods
        and services that may be of interest to you. In the course of such advertising activities, we may, on their
        behalf, or the Third Party Advertiser itself may place or recognize a unique Cookie on your computer or mobile
        device. Any information that Third Party Advertisers collect via Cookies is not linked to any PII collected by
        us. Most web browsers accept cookies automatically. You can delete cookies manually or set your browser to
        automatically delete cookies on a pre-determined schedule. If you decline to accept Cookies, you may not be able
        to take advantage of or participate in certain features of the Services. Our Services enable the use of the
        Adobe Flash Player. Adobe’s Flash Player is used by countless websites and applications that offer video and
        other interactive content. By default, your use of the Adobe Flash Player generates "flash cookies"
        (also known as "persistent identification elements" or "local shared objects"). Adobe
        provides a short disclosure about Flash Cookies in its End User License Agreement, stating "Use of the web
        players, specifically the Flash Player, will enable the Software to store certain user settings as a local
        shared object on our computer. These settings are not associated with you, but allow you to configure certain
        settings within the Flash Player." The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use flash cookies to
        remember user settings, preferences and usage similar to the browser cookies referenced above, but flash cookies
        can store more information than browser cookies and are managed through a different interface than the one
        provided by your web browser. You can control the degree to which you accept flash cookies by accessing your
        Adobe Flash Player management tools directly through the settings manager for Adobe Flash, located at <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>.
        If you do not allow flash cookies to take any disc space on your computer, you may not be able to take advantage
        of or participate in certain features on the Service. Users with a computer running the Windows operating system
        can view flash cookie files in this folder: \Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash
        Player. Users with a computer running the Apple operating system can view flash cookie files in this folder:
        /users/[username]/Library/Preferences/macromedia/Flash Player. Flash cookies, or LSO files are stored typically
        with an ".SOL" extension. </p>
    <p>The Adobe Flash Player is not the only technology being used in the ever-shifting online and mobile content
        environment. HTML5 is an increasingly popular web standard used for presenting content, especially content
        delivered to mobile devices. HTML is the mark-up language used for the World Wide Web. Almost all web pages you
        visit on the Internet are based around HTML code. HTML5 is simply the fifth and latest iteration of this mark-up
        language that allows for more interactive web pages. One of the real benefits of HTML5 is its potential to
        standardize the highly fragmented rich-media universe. Some HTML5 code may allow your response to advertising
        and other activities to be monitored across websites and such information to be stored on your computer or
        mobile device. Technology solutions that allow users to opt-out of or block this sort of tracking are being
        developed through browser add-ons and other tools. </p>
    <p><u>Web Beacons</u>: Our web pages or e-mail messages may contain a small graphic image called a web beacon, which
        is sometimes also called a "clear gif", that allows us to monitor and collect certain limited
        information about our users, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the
        computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small or
        invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail, including
        HTML based content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to count visitors to our web pages or to
        monitor how our users navigate our Services, and we may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count
        how many of the messages we sent were actually opened or acted upon. Web Beacons assist in delivering Cookies
        and help us determine whether a web page or email has been viewed. We use Web Beacons to compile aggregate
        statistics about our Services and our marketing campaigns.</p>
    <p><u>IP Addresses</u>: An IP Address is a number that is assigned to your computer or network when you are linked
        to the Internet. When you request pages from our Services, our servers log your IP Address. We may use IP
        Addresses for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our
        business partners or to audit the use of the Services. We may associate your IP address with the PII you
        provide.</p><h4>2. <u>Use of Information Collected </u></h4>
    <p>Except as specifically outlined in this Privacy Policy, we do not share your PII with non-affiliated third
        parties without your permission. We may, however, share your PII with our owners and other related entities,
        including Sony Pictures Entertainment, AT&amp;T, and their parents, subsidiaries, or affiliated companies, in
        order to provide portions of the Services or to provide other support for a GSN promotion. Please refer to the
        individual privacy policies of our related entities for details concerning how they handle your PII and
        non-personal information.</p>
    <p>In addition, we may provide information to select outside companies when we believe their products or services
        may be of interest to you. If you provide your PII directly to a third party, your direct interactions with that
        third party will be subject to the third party's privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy. Therefore, if you
        later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third
        party directly. GSN may share your PII or other information with third parties under the following
        circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Third parties providing services on our behalf</u>: We may engage third parties to perform services in
            connection with the operation of our business. Examples of these services include: (a) product and/or
            experience customization, (b) distribution of marketing and promotional material, (c) website evaluation,
            (d) data collection, storage, management, analysis and, where applicable, cleansing, and (e) any other
            services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential. These third parties may have access to
            the Services’ user information, including PII, to the extent it is needed to perform their duties and
            functions.
        </li>
        <li><u>Company Security</u>: We may release information about our users, including PII, when legally required to
            do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation or to verify or enforce
            compliance with the policies governing our Services and applicable laws. We may also disclose such user
            information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of GSN, or
            any of our respective affiliates, business partners, customers or others.
        </li>
        <li><u>Aggregate Information</u>: We may disclose non-identifying, aggregated user statistics to third parties
            for a variety of purposes, including describing our services to prospective partners and other third
            parties. Examples of such non-personal information include the number of users who visited the Website
            during a specific time period or redeemed a prize through the Services.
        </li>
        <li><u>Promotions</u>: We may offer promotional content, such as a contest, sweepstakes or promotion in
            connection with our Services. Such promotions may be sponsored by or co-branded with a third party, who may
            obtain the PII that you submit. If you provide information to such third parties, we cannot control those
            third parties' use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared
            with a third party, do not participate in these events. Also, by entering a promotion, we may require you to
            consent to the use of your PII or other information, such as name, voice or likeness, in advertising,
            promotional and marketing materials. In some instances, we may have an arrangement with a promotional
            partner or retailer, whereby they share with us customer information collected on their website. In the
            event that we receive such data and combine it with our customer records, the combined information will be
            treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, all such information is subject to the privacy
            policy under which it was collected.
        </li>
        <li><u>Third Party Offers</u>: From time to time, we are approached by third party companies and organizations
            that provide game-related special offers or other offers that we believe may be of interest to you. In such
            cases, we may use your GSN account information to send out promotional mailings to you on their behalf. If
            you select to sign up for the third party offer, we will share your GSN account information with the third
            party offer provider.
        </li>
        <li><u>Corporate change</u>: We reserve the right to disclose, share and/or otherwise transfer user information,
            including without limitation PII, in connection with a corporate merger, acquisition, consolidation, the
            sale of a portion of our business or the sale of substantially all of GSN’s assets, or other fundamental
            corporate change, whatever form it may take. You will be notified via e-mail or prominent notice on our
            Website prior to a change of ownership or control of your PII, if your PII will be used contrary to this
            policy. For clarification and the removal of doubt, GSN specifically reserves the right to transfer or share
            a copy of PII collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy from the Services, off-line or otherwise, to the
            buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>3. </strong><strong><u>Online Advertising Practices/Third Party Advertisers/Behavioral
        Advertising</u></strong></h4>
    <p><u>Ad Serving Technology</u>: The Services may employ proprietary or third party ad serving technologies that use
        Cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons or other technologies to collect information as a result of ad serving through
        the Services. GSN or third parties operating the ad serving technology (each, a "<strong>Third Party Ad
            Server</strong>") may use demographic and location information, as well as information logged from your
        hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Services and to calculate or
        control the number of unique and repeat views of a given ad, and/or deliver ads that relate to your interests
        and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. We or Third Party Ad Servers may collect data for this purpose,
        including your IP address (including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), device
        ID, information about your software, applications and hardware, machine or device make and model,
        advertisement(s) served, in game location, length of time an advertisement was visible, other Internet and
        website usage information, web pages and mobile Internet sites which have been viewed by you (as well as date
        and time), domain type, size of the advertisement, advertisement response (if any), and angle of view. Note that
        if you click on an ad that appears on the Services, you acknowledge and agree as a result of how that technology
        works that your name or other identifying characteristics may be revealed to the advertiser (or the applicable
        Third Party Ad Server) through referrer headers (the URL transmitted by publishers when users click on ads).</p>
    <p>You recognize and agree that the Third Party Ad Servers who deliver ads for GSN may combine the information
        collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products. These
        companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. These ad serving technologies may be
        integrated into the Services.</p>
    <p>In addition, GSN uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are
        provided by our ad management partners (each, a "<strong>Management Partner</strong>"). These files
        enable our Management Partners to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser. The cookie was placed by us, or
        by another advertiser who works with the applicable Management Partner. The Management Partner may set and
        access its own cookies on your Web browser in order to serve ads it believes may be of interest to you based on
        the profile information you provided to us at registration (e.g., demographic information) as well as
        information collected about you by the applicable Management Partner elsewhere on the Web. Management Partners
        may use information about you gathered from the Services (including your demographic information provided to us
        upon registration as well as your browsing behavior on the Website) to serve third party ads to you elsewhere on
        the Internet. For more information about how cookies work, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative's
        homepage at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>.</p>
    <p><u>Advertising GSN Products &amp; Services</u>: After you use the Services, our advertising partners may deliver
        GSN ads to your Web browser when you are visiting other sites on the Internet. These ads are delivered based on
        cookies that are set by us or by our third party advertising network partners when you visit or use the
        Services, and that are recognized by these companies when you visit other sites. Please see the section above on
        cookies to learn more about setting your Web browser to block cookies.</p><h4>4. <u>Special Notice Regarding
    Children Under 13 Years of Age </u></h4>
    <p>These Services are not aimed at nor intended for children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13,
        please do not use the Services, and if you are over the age of 13 but under the age of 18, you should use the
        Services only with the permission and/or supervision of a parent or legal guardian. Our Services do not accept
        registration from children under the age of 13. No PII is purposefully or knowingly collected from children
        under the age of 13 by GSN. Parents are put on notice that as a result of the foregoing, GSN does not provide a
        mechanism to obtain parental consent.</p>
    <p>If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has submitted his or her PII to GSN, GSN will
        make commercially reasonable efforts to delete the information from its database, at your request. To request
        the deletion of your child's information, please send an email to <a href="mailto:help@gsn.com">help@gsn.com</a>
        and be sure to include in your message the same member name and password that your child submitted. Your use of
        the Services indicates that you hereby represent and warrant that all information you provide, including but not
        limited to age, shall be truthful and correct.</p><h4>5. <u>Data Security </u></h4>
    <p>If you give GSN sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers), GSN will take all commercially reasonable
        steps to protect such information by establishing a secure connection with your Web browser. GSN employs
        industry standard security protocols for encrypting sensitive information provided to us by a third party, to
        protect the transmission of payment information to the Services. Unless otherwise specified herein or on the
        Services, credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing or any
        other purposes.</p>
    <p>While GSN takes precautions against possible breaches in its databases, no website, internet transmission,
        computer system or connection is completely secure. Consequently, GSN cannot guarantee that unauthorized access,
        hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We cannot and do not ensure or warrant the security of
        any information you transmit to GSN and you do so at your own risk.</p>
    <p>GSN urges you to keep your PII safe by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place, separate from your
        account information, as sharing your password with others may lead to unauthorized access to your
        information.</p><h4>6. <u>Postings to GSN Forums </u></h4>
    <p>Please review our restrictions on use and guidelines for user forums in our Terms of Service located at <a href="http://www.gsn.com/corporate/terms.html">http://www.gsn.com/corporate/terms.html</a>. All postings,
        whether in a chat room, on message boards or other method of communication within the Forums will generally be
        available to, and freely accessible by, other users of the GSN Forums as well as the Internet general public.
        Therefore, users should not expect that any information they post will be kept private or confidential and are
        encouraged to exercise discretion when using the GSN Forums. Additionally, your member name will always be
        included in conjunction with your postings in the GSN Forums. And, certain message boards (and similar user
        forums) may display IP addresses and possibly PII along with the message poster's name and message. GSN assumes
        no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information automatically
        included when users use the GSN Forums as described above, or any information users may disclose in user forums
        or other public areas, if any, of the Services. GSN is not responsible for events arising from the distribution
        of any information you choose to publicly post or share through the Forums or other Services.</p><h4>7. <u>Hyperlinks
    To and From Other Websites </u></h4>
    <p>The Services may contain links to, or advertisements concerning, other websites. Other websites may also
        reference, advertise, or link to GSN. GSN is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such
        other websites and expressly disclaims all liability associated with your use of, and the content on, such other
        websites and advertisements. You should check the applicable privacy policy of any website you may click through
        to.</p><h4><strong>8. </strong><u>Social Networking</u></h4>
    <p>GSN may offer you the possibility to connect your accounts from third party social networking sites, such as
        Facebook and Twitter (each, a "<strong>Social Networking Site</strong>"), with the Services by an
        application programming interface (API) or other software. By allowing GSN to connect with your accounts on such
        Social Networking Sites, you consent to GSN’s accessing the information in those accounts, which information may
        include PII. You likewise consent to GSN’s publishing on the Services any such information or actions you take
        on other such Social Networking Sites. Any information accessed or published from your account on a Social
        Networking Site on the Services is subject to GSN’s Terms of Service. It is your choice whether to use any such
        Social Networking Site, and you understand that in some instances such Social Networking Sites may request to
        access and publish information about you or your friends that is included in your GSN Account.</p><h4>9. <u>Consent
    to Processing in the United States</u></h4>
    <p>The Services are operated in the United States. By providing any PII to the Services, all users, including,
        without limitation, users in the member states of the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United
        States fully understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Policy. By using our Services, participating
        in any of our Services and/or providing us with your information, you consent and agree to the collection,
        transfer, storage and processing of your information to and in the United States.</p><h4>10. <u>Maintaining and
    Updating Your Account Information/Unsubscribe</u></h4>
    <p>You have the right to see the PII we collect about you and to correct any inaccuracies in you PII that we retain.
        As part of your use of the Services, you are responsible for maintaining and updating, as applicable, your
        Registration Information with current and complete information. You may edit and delete portions of your GSN
        Account information or delete the GSN Account entirely. To do this, visit the first page after signing in to
        your account, and click on <strong>"Your GSN" </strong>to make changes or deletions. You can also
        write to us to obtain and correct inaccuracies at:</p>
    <p>GSN<br> Attn: Player Support<br> 100 Summer Street, 11<sup>th</sup> Floor</p>
    <p>Boston, MA, 02110</p>
    <p>After receiving any requested changes to your information, we will make reasonable efforts to ensure that all of
        your PII stored in databases we actively use to operate the Services will be updated, corrected, changed or
        deleted, as appropriate, as soon as reasonably practical. However, we reserve the right to retain in our
        archival files, any information we remove from or change in our active Services databases. We may retain such
        information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Service. In addition, it may not
        be technologically possible to remove every record of the information you have previously provided us, as a copy
        may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Therefore, you may
        continue to receive some offers after you send us a request not to use your information for specified marketing
        purposes. Please be aware that we will process your request promptly, but it may take some time to update our
        systems in the ordinary course of our business operations.</p>
    <p>If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13, and you have discovered that your child created
        an account and would like to have it deleted, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:help@gsn.com">help@gsn.com</a>
        with your child's member name and password.</p>
    <p>If you want to opt out of having your PII shared with third parties for marketing purposes, you must consistently
        opt-out at our Services where you register and whenever you provide PII to us. Please bear in mind that this
        opt-out choice for "third parties" will not apply to GSN, GSN licensees and/or co-branding
        participants, as set forth below. Please also keep in mind that any opt-out choices you make will not apply in
        situations where: (a) you either have made, simultaneously make, or later make a specific request for
        information from us; or (b) GSN uses your PII for either operational purposes (e.g., to complete transactions
        requested by you, or to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about
        features of our Services, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy, or any other policy or terms that
        affect you and your use of our Services) or fulfillment purposes (e.g., sharing with companies that facilitate
        communications and transactions with you).</p>
    <p>If you do not exercise your opt-out choices upon registration or otherwise at the time the PII is provided, it
        may take some time to process your opt-out choices. Our systems require time to update, and promotional mailings
        using PII shared before your opt-out may already be in process. Thus, your PII might continue to be shared with
        third parties for promotional purposes for some time after you make your request, For similar reasons, if your
        PII is shared with a third party, GSN largely or completely loses control over how that information is used.
        Thus, even after you have opted out of allowing us to share your PII, you might continue to receive promotional
        materials from third parties unless and until you register your opt-out request with each third party in
        question.</p>
    <p>You should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from
        our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.</p><h4>11. <u>Contact Us
    Regarding Privacy </u></h4>
    <p>GSN is dedicated to protecting your PII and welcomes comments and questions on this Privacy Policy. You may
        e-mail us at the following address:</p>
    <p><a href="mailto:help@gsn.com"><strong>help@gsn.com</strong></a></p>
    <p><u>Notice to California Residents/Your California Privacy Rights</u></p>
    <p>California residents are entitled once a year to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure,
        if any, of PII to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately prior calendar year
        (e.g., requests made in 2016 will receive information about 2015 sharing activities). We comply with this law by
        offering our visitors the ability to tell us not to share your PII with third parties for their direct marketing
        purposes. To make such a request, consistently exercise your opt-out choice whenever you provide PII to us or
        send us a message using the email set forth above. You must include the Services as the subject line, and your
        full name, e-mail address, and postal address in your message. </p>
    <p>Our Services do not recognize browser "Do Not Track" signals, but several of our Third Party Ad Servers
        and Management Partners enable you, in whole or in part, to opt out of the behavioral advertising activities
        described in Paragraph 3 of this Privacy Policy. To learn more about how to opt out of the behavioral
        advertising conducted by these providers you can visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>.
    </p><h4></h4><h4>12. <u>Notification of Changes </u></h4>
    <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, update, add to, discontinue, remove or otherwise change
        any portion of this Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, at any time. When we amend this Privacy Policy, we will
        revise the "last updated" date located at the top of this Privacy Policy for a reasonable amount of
        time. For changes to this Privacy Policy that we consider to be material, we will let you know by displaying a
        notice when you first use the Services after such changes have been made. We may also, at our discretion,
        provide notification of changes by other means. If you provide information to us or access or use the Services
        in any way after this Privacy Policy has been changed, you will be deemed to have unconditionally consented and
        agreed to such changes. The most current version of this Privacy Policy will be available on the Website and the
        Application and will supersede all previous versions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
