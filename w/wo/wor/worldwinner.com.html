<p><b>PRIVACY POLICY FAQ</b></p>

<p><b>Q: What information does WorldWinner collect?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Users must set up an account to play games, enter tournaments, win cash prizes and receive account information via e-mail. Personal information collected for these various purposes - and how it is utilized - is listed below:</p>

<ul>
<p></p><li>When you participate in Guest tournaments, WorldWinner asks only for your e-mail address, though you also need to create a Username that can be displayed on tournament winner lists. Collecting your e-mail allows WorldWinner to send you announcements if you win the tournaments that you participate in and to invite you to participate in invitation-only tournaments. You may choose to receive messages only to your WorldWinner mailbox or to both your personal email address and your WorldWinner mailbox. You may also choose to not to receive messages in either your email or WorldWinner mailbox.  Please note that WorldWinner reserves the right to contact players via email regarding financial and administrative matters associated with their account, such as deposit confirmations, password reminders, and technical support.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>When you participate in our Money tournaments, WorldWinner needs your real name, e-mail address, credit card number, expiration date and billing address. This allows WorldWinner to process tournaments, reward prizes or money and track funds that you withdraw from your WorldWinner account. <p></p>

<p></p></li><li>WorldWinner works with other companies to offer its content and services to users of their Web sites ("Partner Sites"). Even if you enter WorldWinner from a Partner Site, you will register through WorldWinner, and this privacy policy applies to WorldWinner's collection of your information.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>When you submit a bug, suggestion, complaint, question, request, or any other e-mail correspondence, WorldWinner asks for your e-mail address so that you can receive a response. This information will only be used to notify you of receipt of your submission and of a resolution to the inquiry.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>If you win a prize or other promotional feature, WorldWinner may ask for your real name, mailing address, and e-mail address so that you can be notified and arrange for delivery. <p></p>

<p></p></li><li>By signing up for an account, you agree that WorldWinner may display your username and competition results. From time to time, (and usually when you win a prize), WorldWinner may ask you to voluntarily provide general demographic and other personal information for inclusion on the WorldWinner "Winners" page. See section 2.5 of the <a href="/cgi/legal/terms.html#2.5">Terms and Conditions</a> for details about this.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>In addition, WorldWinner also reserves the right to use the information collected to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, as well as new services and special offers you may find valuable. Users that do not want to receive these notifications may opt-out during the registration progress. If you have opted to receive these notifications but no longer wish to receive this information, you can unsubscribe from promotional e-mails by modifying your e-mail preferences on the "Manage Account" page.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>If you are a USA taxpayer and your total winnings on WorldWinner in any given calendar year reach a total of $600, WorldWinner will request that you submit your social security number in order to send you a Form 1099, as required by Internal Revenue Service regulations. Failure to provide your social security number at that time will prevent you from participating in game tournaments.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>We also collect non-personal information that we use to customize your experience on WorldWinner, including: IP address, Internet service provider, geographic location, browser type, operating system, pages viewed on WorldWinner, player rating information, cash and prize winnings and game statistics. Although this information is related to your preferences and activity, it is not associated with your personally identifiable information and cannot be linked to you personally.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>We collect and use account and other personal information to: comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; and/or protect the rights or property of WorldWinner, our users, or others.<p></p>
</li></ul>

<p><b>Q: What are "cookies"? Do you use them?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> A "cookie" is a small data file stored in your computer that enables WorldWinner to identify your computer, and thus enrich your gaming experience by offering customized content based on previous visits to the site. We use cookies to track your visits to WorldWinner so you do not have to re-register each time you visit a page. Some of our advertising is placed by agencies that may use cookies of their own. You may learn more about how they use this information by visiting their sites.
</p> 

<p><b>Q:  Does WorldWinner.com Share the Information It Receives?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and as a result we do not sell it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries WorldWinner controls that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<ul>
<p></p><li><i>Service Providers.</i> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include e-mail, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. <p></p>
<p></p></li><li><i>Partner Sites.</i> WorldWinner may share information with those other companies, in a manner consistent with the privacy policies of those companies. WorldWinner will only share information with those Partner Sites with whom the user already has a relationship and with whom the user already has an agreement concerning the sharing of the user's information.<p></p>
<p></p></li><li><i>Advertisers.</i> We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.<p></p>
<p></p></li><li><i>Protection of WorldWinner and Others.</i> We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of WorldWinner, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<p></p>
<p></p></li><li><i>Corporate Transfers.</i> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries, or business units, or we may share some or all of your personal information with another business entity should we plan to, merge with, or be acquired by that business entity. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that WorldWinner, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. You will be notified of such a transfer through a notice posted on our Web site.<p></p>
<p></p></li><li><i>Legal Compliance.</i>  We release account and other personal information when we are required to do so in order to comply with the law.<p></p>
<p></p></li><li><i>With Your Consent.</i> Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. <p></p>
</li></ul>

<p><b>Q: How can I review and update my personal information?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> You may review your personal information at your "Manage Account" page. There you can modify information that is incorrect or delete information. Information that can be modified includes your password, email address, and credit card. You can also delete your credit card information.</p>

<p><b>Q: How long will it take if I request WorldWinner to forward me all of my personal information?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> In the event you request that WorldWinner forward you all of your personal information on record please allow 7-10 business days to receive the information via email and 10-15 business days via postal mail.</p>

<p><b>Q: What types of E-mails will I receive from WorldWinner?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> WorldWinner utilizes e-mails to notify you when you win tournaments, and to let you know of special promotions, events and policy changes. You have the choice to opt-in or opt-out of receiving certain e-mails at any time by modifying your preferences under the "Manage Account" section of the website or during the registration process. The types of e-mails you could receive from WorldWinner are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p></p><li><i>Tournament Messages:</i>  These e-mails are related to tournament play on the site, and will inform you if you are entitled to an entry fee refund, or if you have been outscored in a tournament.</li><p></p>
<p></p><li><i>Win Notifications:</i>  These e-mails will inform you every time you were declared the winner of a tournament in which you entered.</li><p></p>
<p></p><li><i>WorldWinner Promotions and Player Bonuses:</i> These e-mails provide information about new games and special tournaments and will often include financial benefits, such as additions to your account (for example: "Get $5 and Come Back to see what's New at WorldWinner").</li><p></p>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to modify your email options, <script language="javascript">
if ( !parent.frames['WWmain'] ) { document.write('click the "Change Email" option in your Account settings.'); }
else { document.write('<a href="/cgi/finance/change_email.html">click here</a>'); }
</script>click the "Change Email" option in your Account settings..</p>

<p><b>Q: Will this policy ever change?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> WorldWinner reserves the right to change this policy. While we will indicate material changes by posting a prominent notice on our site, users can also check here to see if a revised policy has been posted. If our policy materially changes, the information we currently have in our files will be subject to the modified policy. You will be notified of a material change in our privacy policy through a notice posted on our Web site.</p>

<p><b>Q: How does WorldWinner protect my personal information?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> WorldWinner has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and/or alteration of your personal information. If you provide us with information (e.g., credit card numbers, address), we encrypt your transmissions using SSL ("Secure Sockets Layer") technology. In addition, we keep personal information you provide on servers that are protected by firewalls and located in a physically secure facility, accessible only by permitted WorldWinner employees. 
</p><p>
You can help maintain your account integrity by selecting passwords that cannot be easily guessed. Take measures to guard them against disclosure and promptly report any security issues to us. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer.  You are responsible for all actions taken with your user ID and password, including fees charged to your account. If you choose to share your user ID and password or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.
</p><p>
When you open a Member account, you are given the option of depositing money into your account via a credit card or PayPal account. We use a credit card processing company, Paymentech, to bill users for deposits to their account. Paymentech does not retain share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.  Users also have the option to deposit money via a PayPal account.   PayPal is an online payment alternative to credit cards. If you do not already have a PayPal account, you will automatically be taken to the PayPal registration form. Assuming your PayPal account is confirmed, your deposit should be available for Money signups almost immediately. You may only have one WorldWinner account per PayPal account.</p>

<p><b>Q: How does WorldWinner know if I consent to the usage outlined here?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> By using the WorldWinner Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by WorldWinner. If the WorldWinner privacy policy materially changes, those changes will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of what information is collected, how the information is used and under what circumstances the information is disclosed.  We will also post a prominent notice on our Website for 30 days.</p>

<p><b>Q: Does WorldWinner collect Personal information about children?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> No. The WorldWinner Web site may only be used by persons 18 years of age or older. Please refer to our Terms and Conditions. </p>

<p><b>Q: What should I do if I have other questions?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> If you have questions about this policy, wish to report a violation, or have any other questions or concerns, please contact us at:  <a href="mailto:playerservices@WorldWinner.com">playerservices@WorldWinner.com</a></p>
