<h4>2. Web Site Use Information</h4>

<span>
Similar to other commercial Web sites, we use "cookies" on this site.
</span>

<p>
<span>
Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site. <b>A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</b>
</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site.
</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>
For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.
</span>

Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to make the site more useful and usable for everyone.
</span>
</p>

<p>

</span>
</p>

<p>

<h4>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</h4>

<h4>We Do Not Rent, Trade, or Sell Your Personal Information</h4>

<p>
<span>
We <b>do not</b> share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide services that you have requested or as required by law.
</span>
</p>


<p>
<span>
Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities as follows:
</span>
</p>

</span>
</p>

<h4>IP Address</h4>

<p>
<span>
IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.
</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>
We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site or the information or content contained therein.
</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>
Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site.  
</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>
Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other web site, including web sites, which have a link on our Website, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.
</span>
</p>


<h4>Your Consent</h4>

<p>
<span>
By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without notice.
</span>
</p>

<h4>Our Commitment to Data Security</h4>

<p>
<span>
Please note that your information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States.
</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>
The laws on holding personal data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your Country of residence or citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
</span>
</p>

<h4>A Special Note About Children</h4>

<p>
<span>
Children are not eligible to use our services unsupervised and we ask that children (under the age of 14) do not submit any personal information to us.
</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>
If you are a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction with permission and guidance from your parents or guardians.
</span>
</p>

<h4>Change In Assets or Ownership</h4>

<p>
<span>
In the event that the web site (or a substantial portion of its assets) is acquired, your information would be considered part of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are transferred.
</span>
</p>

<h4>Changes to Privacy Policy</h4>

<p>
<span>
Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time. 
</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>
However, if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy without your prior consent.
</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>
We will post the new policy on this page, and, if the changes allow us to use personally identifying information in ways that are different from the ways specified at the time the information was originally collected.
</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>
Each version of this privacy policy will be identified by its effective date, which you can find at the bottom of the page.
