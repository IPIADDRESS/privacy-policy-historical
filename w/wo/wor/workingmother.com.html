              and how are they used</span></p>

            <p class="body"><span class="body">As part of offering and providing 

              customizable and personalized Services, Working Mother Media uses cookies to store 

              and sometimes track information about you. Working Mother Media also collects non-personally 

              identifiable information, such as aggregate use statistics for the 

              Services. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your 

              browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. 

              All areas on the Sites and any Working Mother Media co-branded and/or partner Web 

              sites linked to the Sites (collectively, the "Network") where you 

              are prompted to log-in or that are customizable will require that 

              you accept cookies. Generally, We may use cookies to:</span></p>

            <p class="body"><span class="body">(1) Remind Us of who you are, to 

              access your account information (stored on our computers) and in 

              the future to deliver to you better and more personalized Services. 

              This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In" and may be modified 

              when you "Sign Out" of the Services.</span></p>

            <p class="body"><span class="body">(2) Estimate our audience size. Each 

              browser accessing the Sites is given a unique cookie which is then 

              used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered 

              User versus by an unregistered User, and to help target advertisements 

              based on User interests and behavior.</span></p>

            <p class="body"><span class="body">(3) Assist merchants in stores accessible 

              on or through the Sites to track visits to and business to their 

              stores. This information collected by cookies is sometimes called 

              "clickstream" or "click trail" and may also describe which pages 

              you have seen in each merchant's store.</span></p>

            <p class="body"><span class="body">(4) Track your progress and number 

              of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes and contests. 

              When a promotion offered on or through the Sites uses cookies, the 

              information written to the cookie indicates the player's progress 

              through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, 

              and status in prize drawings.</span></p>

            <p class="body"><span class="body">(5) Measure certain traffic patterns, 

              which areas of the Network you have visited, and your visiting patterns 

              in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our Users' 

              habits are similar or different from one another so that We can 

              make each new experience on the Network a better one. We may use 

              this information to better personalize the content, banners, and 

              promotions that you and other Users will see on the Network.</span></p>

            <p class="body"><span class="body">Advertising networks that serve ads 

              onto the Sites may also use their own cookies.</span></p>

              system administration and to report aggregate information to our 

              advertisers. In addition, WorkingMother.com Mail includes IP addresses 

              in outgoing mail message headers.</span></p>

            <p class="body"><span class="body">Please note that third-party advertisers 

              and other third parties may collect information about you, through 

              cookies or other technologies, when you visit their Web sites or 

              when they serve advertisements through the Services and/or the Sites. 

              These companies may use information (not including your name, address, 

              email address or telephone number) about your visits to the Sites 

              and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods

              their practices or the content of their Web sites, including, without 

              limitation, their use of any information (such as IP number, browser 

              type, or operating system) collected when you "click through" links

            <p class="body"><span class="bold">3<a name="3"></a>. How your information 

              is used</span></p>

            <p class="body"><span class="body">(1) Non-personally identifiable information:<br>

              We use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form 

              to build higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical 

              analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our Visitors, 

              and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas 

              of the Sites. We may provide statistical information based on this 

              data to advertisers, affiliates, clients, and other current and 

              potential business partners.</span></p>

            <p class="body"><span class="body">(2) Personally identifiable information:<br>

              Working Mother Media's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide 

              you, the User, with a customized experience on the Network. This 

              may include (but is not exclusive to) personalization services, 

              interactive communications, online shopping and many other types 

              of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order 

              to provide services free of charge, We display advertisements. By 

              knowing a little about you, Working Mother Media is able to deliver more relevant 

              advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.</span></p>

            <p class="body"><span class="body">In the role of delivering targeted 

              advertisements that Working Mother Media plays, the advertisers give Us an advertisement 

              and tell Us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, 

              females over 35 years old). Working Mother Media takes the advertisement and displays 

              it to Users meeting that criteria. In this process, the advertiser 

              never has access to individual account information. Only Working Mother Media has 

              access to individuals' accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting 

              is done with banner ads as well as promotional email through the 

              Sites. You will only receive special offers via email from Working Mother Media 

              if you have indicated in your account preferences that you would 

              like to receive them. You can change your account preferences at 

              any time.</span></p>

            <p class="body"><span class="body">When you place an order with Working Mother Media, 

              and not with any of our partners, We ask for additional information 

              (including, for example, your full billing address, your shipping 

              address, your credit card number and expiration date, and phone 

              number(s), as well as other personally identifiable information 

              necessary to confirm your identity with the credit card company 

              (e.g., mother's maiden name)). We consider this information to be 

              highly confidential. This information is kept on a secure server 

              to protect it from outside parties. We share this information only 

              with our fulfillment vendors and other third parties, who will only 

              use this information to fulfill your order and generate aggregated 

              statistical information, but such aggregated information will exclude 

              your credit card number and expiration date and any other personally 

              identifiable information.</span></p>

            <p class="body"><span class="body">We reserve the right to disclose

              Specifically, but without limitation, We reserve the right to disclose 

              such information when a Visitor is in violation of our Terms of 

              Use, or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably 

              suspected of partaking) in any harmful, infringing, or illegal activity. 

              To the extent permitted by law, We reserve the right to disclose 

              such information without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, 

              and to disclose such information in response to court and governmental 

              orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests, as otherwise required 

              by law, or in response to allegations of infringement. Subject to 

              applicable privacy laws, We cooperate with law enforcement agencies 

              in identifying those who may be using our Services and/or Sites 

              for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report any 

              suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation 

              or prosecution, or to suspend or terminate your use of any Services 

              and/or Sites in connection with any suspected illegal activity.</span></p>
