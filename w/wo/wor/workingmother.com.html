              All areas on the Sites and any WMAC co-branded and/or partner Web 
              sites linked to the Sites (collectively, the "Network") where you 
              are prompted to log-in or that are customizable will require that 
              you accept cookies. Generally, We may use cookies to:</span></p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body">(1) Remind Us of who you are, to 
              access your account information (stored on our computers) and in 
              the future to deliver to you better and more personalized Services. 
              This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In" and may be modified 
              when you "Sign Out" of the Services.</span></p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body">(2) Estimate our audience size. Each 
              browser accessing the Sites is given a unique cookie which is then 
              used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered 
              User versus by an unregistered User, and to help target advertisements 
              based on User interests and behavior.</span></p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body">(3) Assist merchants in stores accessible 
              on or through the Sites to track visits to and business to their 
              stores. This information collected by cookies is sometimes called 
              "clickstream" or "click trail" and may also describe which pages 
              you have seen in each merchant's store.</span></p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body">(4) Track your progress and number 
              of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes and contests. 
              When a promotion offered on or through the Sites uses cookies, the 
              information written to the cookie indicates the player's progress 
              through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, 
              and status in prize drawings.</span></p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body">(5) Measure certain traffic patterns, 
              which areas of the Network you have visited, and your visiting patterns 
              in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our Users' 
              habits are similar or different from one another so that We can 
              make each new experience on the Network a better one. We may use 
              this information to better personalize the content, banners, and 
              promotions that you and other Users will see on the Network.</span></p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body">Advertising networks that serve ads 
              onto the Sites may also use their own cookies.</span></p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body">WMAC also collects IP addresses for 
              system administration and to report aggregate information to our 
              advertisers. In addition, WorkingMother.com Mail includes IP addresses 
              in outgoing mail message headers.</span></p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body">Please note that third-party advertisers 
              and other third parties may collect information about you, through 
              cookies or other technologies, when you visit their Web sites or 
              when they serve advertisements through the Services and/or the Sites. 
              These companies may use information (not including your name, address, 
              email address or telephone number) about your visits to the Sites 
              and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods 
              and services of interest to you. If you would like more information

              Web sites, which may or may not be operated in conjunction with 
              the Sites. We do not monitor or control the information collection 
              or privacy practices of third parties, and are not responsible for 
              their practices or the content of their Web sites, including, without 
              limitation, their use of any information (such as IP number, browser 
              type, or operating system) collected when you "click through" links 
              to their Web sites. Please contact such third parties if you have

            <p class="body"><span class="bold">3<a name="3"></a>. How your information 
              is used</span></p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body">(1) Non-personally identifiable information:<br>
              We use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form 
              to build higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical 
              analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our Visitors, 
              and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas 
              of the Sites. We may provide statistical information based on this 
              data to advertisers, affiliates, clients, and other current and 
              potential business partners.</span></p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body">(2) Personally identifiable information:<br>
              WMAC's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide 
              you, the User, with a customized experience on the Network. This 
              may include (but is not exclusive to) personalization services, 
              interactive communications, online shopping and many other types 
              of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order 
              to provide services free of charge, We display advertisements. By 
              knowing a little about you, WMAC is able to deliver more relevant 
              advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.</span></p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body">In the role of delivering targeted 
              advertisements that WMAC plays, the advertisers give Us an advertisement 
              and tell Us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, 
              females over 35 years old). WMAC takes the advertisement and displays 
              it to Users meeting that criteria. In this process, the advertiser 
              never has access to individual account information. Only WMAC has 
              access to individuals' accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting 
              is done with banner ads as well as promotional email through the 
              Sites. You will only receive special offers via email from WMAC 
              if you have indicated in your account preferences that you would 
              like to receive them. You can change your account preferences at 
              any time.</span></p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body">When you place an order with WMAC, 
              and not with any of our partners, We ask for additional information 
              (including, for example, your full billing address, your shipping 
              address, your credit card number and expiration date, and phone 
              number(s), as well as other personally identifiable information 
              necessary to confirm your identity with the credit card company 
              (e.g., mother's maiden name)). We consider this information to be 
              highly confidential. This information is kept on a secure server 
              to protect it from outside parties. We share this information only 
              with our fulfillment vendors and other third parties, who will only 
              use this information to fulfill your order and generate aggregated 
              statistical information, but such aggregated information will exclude 
              your credit card number and expiration date and any other personally 
              identifiable information.</span></p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body">We reserve the right to disclose 
              information concerning any User of the Services and/or the Sites 
              as We reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business. 
              Specifically, but without limitation, We reserve the right to disclose 
              such information when a Visitor is in violation of our Terms of 
              Use, or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably 
              suspected of partaking) in any harmful, infringing, or illegal activity. 
              To the extent permitted by law, We reserve the right to disclose 
              such information without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, 
              and to disclose such information in response to court and governmental 
              orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests, as otherwise required 
              by law, or in response to allegations of infringement. Subject to 
              applicable privacy laws, We cooperate with law enforcement agencies 
              in identifying those who may be using our Services and/or Sites 
              for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report any 
              suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation 
              or prosecution, or to suspend or terminate your use of any Services 
              and/or Sites in connection with any suspected illegal activity.</span></p>

              other than WMAC or may be cosponsored by WMAC and another company. 
              Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with 
              the sponsor. You can decide not to participate in the promotion
