You should therefore treat any information provided by you in the content of a submission or post to a community as public information. For this reason, we urge you to act cautiously in providing any such information in your submissions or posts, as we are not liable for any use or misuse by an individual user of the information you provide in a submission or post.</p>

Please note, that we will NEVER send you an email with an imbedded link that asks for your password or any financial or account information; passwords are for your protection. If you EVER receive such an email, please contact us immediately using the information in the Section 9 below entitled <i>“Contact Us”.</i></p>
<p align="justify">We use pixel tags to identify what pages of our website are visited most frequently and to evaluate the effectiveness of the search functions on our website.</p>

In addition, we use reasonable technical and physical measures to limit the disclosure of Personal Information consistent with this privacy policy. However, Personal Information can never be 100% secure: information may be transmitted over networks without appropriate security measures and may be accessed, deleted, altered, used or disclosed by unauthorized persons.
