<p>We will use the information we automatically collected through your access and use of our Websites to determine how our Websites are accessed and used.  For example, this information will allow us (i) to determine which pages are the most popular with users, (ii) determine if our Websites are working properly, and (iii) to improve the user-experience on our Websites.  We do not use automatically collected information to identify a particular user.</p>
<p>We may aggregate and use certain non-personally identifiable information for research or marketing purposes and may share, sell and rent or trade that information and statistical data derived from such information with our marketing partners, advertisers, or other third parties for research or marketing purposes.</p>
<h4>4.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">User Communities on our Websites.</span></h4>
<p>As stated above, we collect information about you through your interactions with us.  Our Websites include community areas (e.g., forums, bulletin boards and chat rooms) in which you may participate after establishing a Membership Account.  Although your participation in these communities is governed by this privacy policy, there are certain important characteristics of these communities that you should always keep in mind.</p>
<p>We use Membership Account registration information and other information users provide as they interact within the communities to: authenticate users; provide communications from us to users regarding the community; and administer the community (including, but not limited to, managing the technical requirements of the site and monitoring submissions and posts for offensive content after posting and removing such content in our sole discretion).</p>
<p><strong>Please note that information (including your name, email address, address, or phone number) you provide in a posting on community or any bulletin board is available (even after you stop participating in the community) to any other individual who has access to that same community and may be used by another individual in a manner unintended by you, including as a target for unsolicited communications.</strong> You should therefore treat any information provided by you in the content of a submission or post to a community as public information.  For this reason, we urge you to act cautiously in providing any such information in your submissions or posts, as we are not liable for any use or misuse by an individual user of the information you provide in a submission or post.</p>
<p>Upon termination of a community, Personal Information we collected through the community will continue to be treated in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

<p>“Cookies” are small text files that a website sends to a user’s hard drive through the browser for data storage.

Our cookies will never be used to track your activity on any third party websites or to send spam.  You can configure your browser to accept all Cookies, reject all Cookies, or notify you when a Cookie is received. (Each browser is different, so check the Help menu of your browser to learn how to change your Cookie preferences).  You may reject, delete or otherwise disable Cookies at any time.  However, by deleting, rejecting or otherwise disabling Cookies, you may inhibit your user experience on our Websites and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings on our Websites.

Some of our email communications to you may include a “click-through URL” linked to a particular page on one of our Websites.  By clicking on one of these URLs, you will automatically enter one of our Websites.  Our systems track this information to gauge the effectiveness of our email communications and your level of interest in particular areas.  You may avoid having this information collected by avoiding clicking on URL links in our email communications.  Please note, that we will NEVER send you an email with an imbedded link that asks for your password or any financial or account information; passwords are for your protection.  If you EVER receive such an email, please contact us immediately using the information in the Section 9 below entitled “Contact Us”.</p>
