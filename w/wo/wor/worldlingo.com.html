      <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
      <p>In general, you can visit WorldLingo online without telling us who you are and without sharing any personal information.
        There are times however, when we will require information from you.</p>
      <p>You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information,
        such as your name and e-mail address enabling us to correspond with you, to process an order, or to provide you with a
        subscription service.</p>
      <p>You may also provide us with your credit card details to purchase a service from us or a description of your education and
        work experience in connection with a vacancy at WorldLingo that you wish to be considered for. We intend to let you know how
        we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to
        make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information
        about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so.</p>
      <h2>We collect your personal information by the following methods:</h2>
      <h2>1.1 Registration</h2>

        you are required to provide the following contact information: first name, last name and email address. <i>A secure password
        containing letters and numbers maybe generated at random by WorldLingo; alternatively you will be able to choose your
        own password.</i></p>
      <p>You have the option to provide us with demographic information such as preferred currency and gender; we encourage you
        to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site.</p>
      <p>WorldLingo Translations LLC is the sole owner of the information collected on WorldLingo’s Web site.</p>
      <h2>1.2 Profile Information</h2>
      <p>When you become a user, you may provide additional information in the Manage My Account section of your account; selecting
        your preferred source and target language, your country of residence, preferred currency and time zone. Providing additional
        information beyond that which is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables us to provide you with an enhanced
        user experience as we can select appropriate values during servicing you; for example providing online payment for a translation
        project.</p>
      <h2>1.3 Orders</h2>
      <p>If you purchase a service from us, we request certain personal data from you on our order form. You must provide contact
        information (name, email and billing address) and financial information (credit card number and expiry date). We use this
        information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use the details
        provided to contact you.</p>
      <h2>1.4 Log Files</h2>
      <p>We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP)
        addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and
        clickstream data.</p>
      <p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track
        users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link
        this automatically collected data to personal data.</p>
      <p>We use a third-party tracking service, Google Analytics that uses cookies to track non-personal data about visitors
        to our site to be able to gain demographic data about the location of our visitors and total number of users.</p>

        the site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personal data you submit while on the site.</p>
      <p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for the user to navigate
        our site. A session ID cookie expires when the browser is closed. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for
        an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.</p>
      <p>We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies
