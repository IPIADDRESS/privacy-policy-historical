<p><strong>How Personal Information is Disclosed </strong></p>
<p>Your Personal Information may be disclosed:</p>

<li>if you choose to download a white paper, eBook, or other resource, to our clients, partners and current and future sponsors of that resource. If you do not want to be contacted by these third parties, please do not download, view or otherwise access the white papers, eBooks and other resources.</li>
<li>if you post your resume on the Site and elect to permit it to be searched by potential employers and staffing agencies, to these potential employers and staffing agencies. We do not control the use and disclosure of Personal Information by these potential employers and staffing agencies. While it is our goal that only employers or staffing agencies will gain access to Personal Information in resumes, we cannot guarantee that no other persons or entities will gain such access. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OR DISCLOSURE BY OTHERS OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE IN YOUR RESUME.</li>
<li>to third party sponsors of sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>NON-personal Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>Non-Personal Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser information</li>
<li>Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies</li>
<li>Demographic information and other information provided by you</li>
<li>Aggregated information</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How We Collect Non-Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>We and our third party service providers may collect Non-Personal Information from you, including your MAC address, your computer type, screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, as well as demographic data, for example, your location, educational degree, balance on mortgage, value of real estate, income, age, weight, type of insurance, diabetic or smoking-related statistics. We also aggregate Personal Information in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. We also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, or other similar technologies for example to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status or to measure the effectiveness of e-mail communications. We may link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
<p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use and Disclose Non-Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose. &nbsp;In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>
<p><strong>IP ADDRESSES</strong></p>
<p>Your “<strong>IP Address</strong>” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).</p>
<p><strong>How We Log IP Addresses </strong></p>
<p>An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use and Disclose IP Addresses?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, geographic mapping and administering the Site. We may also use and disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information. Please note that we treat IP Addresses, server log files and related information as Non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>THIRD PARTY SITES</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site to which this Site contains a link or a widget on our site.&nbsp; The inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us or by our affiliates.&nbsp; We may also utilize framing techniques that may make it appear that you are still on the site when you are actually on a third party web site.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party VENDORS</strong></p>
