This means that a user's  session will be tracked, but the user will remain anonymous.

<strong>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</strong><br>
<br>
Personally Identifiable Information (PII):<br>
We share PII with Third Parties to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples include fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments,  delivering packages, sending email and postal mail, and analyzing data  for the purposes of data scrubbing and marketing assistance. We do not  share PII with Third Parties for any unknown or unrelated uses. <br>
<br>
We reserve the right to disclose PII as required by law and when we  believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or  comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served  on our Web site. <br>
<br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes  to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem  appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how  we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We  reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so  please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this  policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on  our homepage. <br>
