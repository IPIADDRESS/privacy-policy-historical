</ul>
<h1>8.&nbsp;Sharing your information</h1>
<p><span>8.1.&nbsp;</span>We will not share your personal information with anyone else unless you have consented to this, other than in limited circumstances including the following:</p>
<ul>

Additionally, if you win a prize in any such promotion, we may disclose personal information about you to third parties in connection with tax reporting obligations.</p>
<p><span>8.3.</span>&nbsp;We may share anonymous information (meaning information that does not identify and that cannot reasonably be used to identify any individual user) and aggregated information (meaning information about groups and categories of users, including game statistics and behaviour, but which does not identify and that cannot reasonably be used to identify any individual user) with our advertising partners and other third parties for various purposes. We may also allow our advertisers and advertising services companies to collect anonymous information and aggregated information within the Services and they may then share that information with us. Advertisers and advertising services companies operating on the Services may collect personally identifiable information over time and across different websites when you use the Services. Advertisers and advertising services companies may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. This enables our advertisers and advertising services companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Services and on the websites of third parties, so that they can try to serve you with advertisements for products and services that are most likely to be of interest to you. Advertisers and advertising services companies may also use this information to monitor, improve, or modify their operations.
