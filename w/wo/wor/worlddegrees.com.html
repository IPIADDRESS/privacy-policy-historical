This privacy policy describes Future Students’ information-handling practices as they pertain to (i) visitors to our website located at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.futurestudents.com">www.futurestudents.com</a>&nbsp;(the “Site”), (ii) our dealings with our customers, and (iii) our targeted advertising services (the “Services”).</p>
<h2>1. THE SITE AND OUR DEALINGS WITH CUSTOMERS</h2>
<h6>Information Collected via the Site</h6>
<p>The Site is intended primarily to offer information about Future Students and the services we provide.</p>
<p>We may collect information about you during your use of the Site, such as the server your computer is logged onto (i.e., your IP address) and your browser type (for example, FireFox or Internet Explorer). Future Students may use this information for its internal business purposes but will not sell, share with, or rent this information to any third outside. This information will not be used by Future Students to contact or identify any person individually.</p>
<p>The Site may contain links to other websites. Such websites may use cookies and/or other data collection tools. Future Students is not responsible for the privacy practices, policies or content of such other websites.</p>
<h6>Dealings with Customers</h6>
<p>We may also collect personal information from our customers from time to time, such as their name, address, and contact details when we communicate with them in person, over the phone, in emails, or otherwise. In some circumstances we may collect customers’ personal information from a third party who is dealing with us on the customers’ behalf.</p>
<p>We will only use customers’ personal information to provide them with assistance or services they have requested, to operate our business, or as otherwise permitted by law.</p>
<p>Future Students may from time to time send existing customers information and marketing materials relating to the business. Future Students will obide by Australian laws relating to the use of electronic messages (email, SMS, MMS and instant messaging), telephone and faxes for marketing purposes, including the ability for recipients to ‘opt-out’ from receiving such messages at any time.</p>
<h2>2. THE SERVICES</h2>
<h6>Overview of Future Students’ Services</h6>
<p>Future Students collects information about the website(s) that you visit and the advertisements that you see while online via Future Students’ technology provider (the “Technology”). You may encounter the Technology when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Future Students or one of our Advertisers displays online advertisements on a website that you visit;</li>
<li>when you open an email that contains an advertisement placed by Future Students or one of our Advertisers; and/or</li>
<li>when one of the Advertisers places one of Future Students’ web beacons on a website that you visit.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use the information collected by the Technology in order to help make the Advertisements you see more relevant to you, and for Advertisement delivery and reporting purposes.</p>
<h6>Information Collected via the Services</h6>
<p>The Technology collects and uses information regarding your interaction with the Services, including, without limitation, the IP address used to access the Internet, the type of browser used, which and how many Advertiser webpages have been viewed, search terms entered on Advertiser websites, referral URLs, and the date and time of website visits.</p>
<p>Future Students uses this information to analyse trends, identify the audience most likely to respond to an advertisement and to tailor advertisement placements for Future Students’ Advertisers accordingly. This information may be shared with third parties (see the “Disclosure of Information to Third Parties” section below). This information will not be used by Future Students to contact or identify any person individually.</p>
<h6>Cookies and Web Beacons</h6>
<p>Future Students uses cookies and web beacons in connection with the Technology. These cookies and web beacons are served by our existing and future technology partners, including but not limited to Brandscreen, TubeMogul, Doubleclick(Google), Turn and Adap.TV, Appnexus, Mediamath etc.. Cookies are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters. Certain cookies, persistent cookies, remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. You can also remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. Cookies help Future Students better understand the effectiveness of a Future Students Advertisement (for example, by tracking the way in which you may respond to, and interact with, a Future Students Advertisement, or the location and context in which you view a Future Students Advertisement). Future Students’ cookies may also help control the number of times you view a Future Students Advertisement.</p>
<p>Web beacons (also known as “1X1 pixels” or “clear GIFs”) are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a webpage or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. Future Students also uses web beacons, in combination with cookies, to analyse usage patterns. The use of a web beacon allows Future Students to record when you have visited a particular webpage or interacted with a certain email, along with additional information that the website or email may choose to include with the beacon.</p>
<h6>Third Party Links and Websites</h6>
<p>Advertisements may contain links to other websites, including those of the Advertisers and our contractors and affiliates. Such websites may use cookies and/or other data collection tools. Future Students is not responsible for the privacy practices, policies or the content of such websites. Future Students encourages everyone to read the posted privacy policies whenever interacting with any website to learn more about the privacy practices of that website. Future Students has no control over the use of any information by third party websites, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any information. Similarly, Future Students does not have access to, or control of, the cookies and/or other data collection tools that may be placed on any advertisement by a third-party, including those of the Advertisers, and this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies and/or other data collection tools by any third party other than in connection with the Site and the Services.</p>
<h6>Storage of Information</h6>
