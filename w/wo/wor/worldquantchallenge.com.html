This Privacy Policy explains, in general, what Personal Information (as defined below) is collected on the Web Site, how the information is used, and with whom we may share such information. By visiting the Web Site, and/or using any capability, software or service that may be made available through the Web Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy as they may be amended from time to time. As we update and expand our services, this Privacy Policy may change, so check back to this page from time to time.

</div>
<h2>Cookies and Related Technologies and Web Site Usage Information</h2>
<div>
When you use the Web Site and/or any capability, software or service that may be made available either through the Web Site or that is used to access the Web Site, we collect certain information by automated or electronic means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs ("Web Site Usage Information"). As you use the Web Site and/or any such capability, software or service, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us and services providers to coordinate and record the interactivity and fill your requests for services and information. The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to us by your computers or mobile devices. These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers. For example, when you access the Web Site and/or any such capability, software or service, we and our service providers may place cookies on your computers or mobile devices. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return so you will not be required to register again for use of the same and track your use of the Web Site and/or any such capability, software or service. They also help us to detect certain kinds of fraud. A "cookie" is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your registration and your use of the Web Site and/or any such capability, software or service. Some cookies contain numbers that allow us to connect the Web Site and/or any such capability, software or service activity with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with the Web Site and/or any such capability, software or service. Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. "Session" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views. Your browser usually erases session cookies once you exit your browser. "Persistent" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser. We use persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided and storing such information.<br><br>
Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve the Web Site and/or any such capability, software or service.<br><br>
We collect many different types of Web Site Usage Information. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access the Web Site and/or any capability, software or service that may be made available through the Web Site, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. Our server logs also record the Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses of the devices you use to interact with the Web Site and/or any such capability, software or service. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. <br><br>
In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about users of the Web Site and/or any such capability, software or service to optimize same and understand its usage patterns. In other cases, we may associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. In that case, this Privacy Statement governs how we use that information.
