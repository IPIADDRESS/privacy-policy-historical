              <p>Sensitive information is protected in its transfer as well as
                its storage. At appropriate points, the sites use a VeriSign
                SSL (secure socket layer) security certificate to enable encrypted
                transfer of data. For example, we use encryption whenever financial
                information is requested of you. Encryption is the process of
                scrambling data into an unreadable format that is more secure
                for transmission over the Internet. Encryption takes your data
                and uses complex mathematical equations called algorithms to
                scramble the information into an unreadable format called ciphertext.
                The ciphertext is impossible to read without having a key to
                unscramble the information to its original form. </p>
