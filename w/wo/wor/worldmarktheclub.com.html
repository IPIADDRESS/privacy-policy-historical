		  <a name="Use of Cookies"></a> 
		  <h5>Use of Cookies</h5>
		  <p>A cookie is a piece of data generated by a Web site and stored on your computer. Our Sites may use cookies to track unique visits. This simply means that visits to the Site can be uniquely identified and tracked from page to page. However, it does not tell us who you are specifically, only that you are a unique visitor. Our Sites may also use cookies to keep visitors logged into secure areas as they navigate from page to page. This eliminates the need to log in multiple times during your visit. We may also use cookies to help our Sites remember the preferences or settings you may set in different Site functions.</p>
		  <p>We do not have access to and cannot control cookies set by Web sites we link to or that link to our Sites.</p>
		  <p><span class="nav"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></span></p>
		  <a name="Use of Internet Protocol IP Addresses"></a> 
		  <h5>Use of Internet Protocol  ("IP")  Addresses</h5>
		  <p>An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet so that your computer can be identified by the main computers, known as  "Web servers,"  that  "serve up"  Web pages.</p>
		  <p><strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> and/or its affiliates collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated Information to our affiliates, and to audit the use of our site. When Customers request pages from <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> and/or its affiliates’ sites, our servers log the Customers’ IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a Customer’s session will be logged, but the Customer will remain anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a Customer when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Site terms of use or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others.</p>
		  <p><span class="nav"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></span></p>
		  <a name="Information Collection"></a> 
		  <h5>Information Collection</h5>
		  <p>In most instances, we collect Information by specifically requesting it from you. Generally, this occurs when you register at a site, participate in a promotional event, purchase a membership in WorldMark The Club, or request information or a service. Usually, our sites and service partners use your information to operate the sites, inform those individuals having purchased a membership in WorldMark The Club  ("Owners") of events and happenings, and to deliver services. Our sites also use your information to inform you about other products or services available from <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> and its affiliates.</p>
		  <p>We may also collect information provided by our affiliates and/or third parties. This information is generally non-personal information, relating to demographic traits and purchasing habits.</p>
		  <p><span class="nav"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></span></p>
		  <a name="Forms"></a> 
		  <h5>Forms</h5>
		  <p>Some of our sites and promotions may require a completed form in order to access secured information, use special site functions, qualify for contests or complete a transaction. Online and hard copy contest entry forms may require your contact information, demographics, unique identifiers, shipping or billing information, credit card number and other personal or financial information. We may also use some of this information to contact you about the services for which you have expressed interest, <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> promotional and Owner events, and/or important support information.</p>
		  <p>If you elect to use our referral service to inform other people about our products or services, their information is collected so that we may contact them in regards to the referral.</p>
		  <p><span class="nav"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></span></p>
		  <a name="Child Use of Sites"></a> 
		  <h5>Child Use of Sites</h5>
		  <p>The <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> web sites, including the Vacation Forum, are not intended for use by children under 18 years of age. Furthermore, it is not our intention to extend promotional offers to children. Should this occur in error, we will take immediate action, upon notification of the child’s age, to modify our records and eliminate the chance for future offers of this nature.</p>
		  <p><span class="nav"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></span></p>
		  <a name="Notifications and Verifications"></a> 
		  <h5>Notifications and Verifications</h5>
		  <p>We may use e-mail or other contact methods to notify site users and

            The Club</strong> special offers, newsletters, and site alerts or 
            features. We may also use e-mail or other contact methods to disseminate 
            PINS and passwords, validate requests and provide customer support.</p>
          <p><strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> believe 
            that all E-mail and any attachments are free of any virus, worm, Trojan

Personal Information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

		  <p>We use a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services you may acquire or arrange via our sites. In addition, we may store credit card information for WorldMark The Club Owners as a convenience to you for future purchases you may make. However, we do not share this information outside of normal credit card processing.</p>
		  <p>Business Partners and Sponsors: We may disclose some or all of your Personal Information to business partners or sponsors who work on behalf of or with <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your Personal Information to help us communicate with you about offers from <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. We may share the Personal Information we collect with other entities, such as:</p>

This information generally relates to your travel and purchasing habits.</p>
		  <p><span class="nav"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></span></p>
		  <a name="Third Party and Aggregate Data"></a> 
		  <h5>Third Party and Aggregate Data</h5>
		  <p>From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If you opt to receive information from these third parties, we will (with your permission) share your name and e-mail address with such third parties. Also, we may keep track of what portions of the Web site Customers are visiting and other Customer statistics, and aggregate this information to help us create a better experience for users of our Web site. This is all done without knowing your name or other Personal Information in order to describe our viewers and services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. </p>
		  <p><em>What happens when you link to a third party site? </em></p>
		  <p><strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> are not responsible for the content of any off-site pages or any other Web sites linked to or from the sites. Links appearing on the sites are for convenience only and are not an endorsement by <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> or our affiliates or their partners of the referenced content, product, service or supplier. Your linking to or from any off-site pages or other Web sites is at your own risk. <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> are in no way responsible for examining or evaluating, and they do not warrant the offerings of, off-site pages or any other Web sites linked to or from the sites, nor do we assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, content, products, or services of such pages and Web sites, including, without limitation, terms and conditions. You should carefully review the terms and conditions of all off-site pages and other Web sites that you visit.</p>
		  <p>Third-party Web sites may refer to our sites and even provide hyperlinks to specific pages or functions. We are not responsible for the context in which those referring links are made nor are we responsible for ensuring those links work properly.</p>
		  <p><span class="nav"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></span></p>
		  <a name="Safeguarding Customer Information"></a> 
		  <h5>Safeguarding Customer Information</h5>
		  <p>We only grant access to nonpublic personal information about you (such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and credit card information as described above) to company employees and affiliated and non-affiliated service providers so that they can provide or offer products and services to you, process and service your accounts, and administer our business.</p>
		  <p>Our Code of Conduct requires that your information remain confidential. Even if you are no longer our customer, we will continue to treat your nonpublic personal information in the same way as if you were still a customer. In addition, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard this personal information. Some state laws may further restrict the sharing of your nonpublic personal information.</p>
		  <p><em>Other:</em> We may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> terms of use or terms of service, or may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with any <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong>’s rights or property, other <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> Customers, or anyone else. <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.</p>
		  <p><em>Is my information secure from others using the <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> sites?</em></p>
		  <p>Sensitive information is protected in its transfer as well as its storage. At appropriate points, the sites use a VeriSign SSL (secure socket layer) security certificate to enable encrypted transfer of data. For example, we use encryption whenever financial information is requested of you. Encryption is the process of scrambling data into an unreadable format that is more secure for transmission over the Internet. Encryption takes your data and uses complex mathematical equations called algorithms to scramble the information into an unreadable format called ciphertext. The ciphertext is impossible to read without having a key to unscramble the information to its original form.</p>
		  <p>Information is encrypted at the client side (your browser) and then unscrambled or decrypted at the server side (<strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong>). The most common levels of encryption are 40-bit, 56-bit and 128-bit and they have been implemented commercially in popular browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.</p>
		  <p>It is your responsibility as a site user to determine the encryption level appropriate for you and to ensure your browser operates at that level. Our sites currently support all three levels of encryption to accommodate the largest number of users. To upgrade your Netscape or Microsoft browser, visit the appropriate web site.</p>
		  <p>Although we make every effort to help ensure your information is securely transmitted, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Once we receive your transmission, <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> uses industry standards efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers.</p>
		  <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. </p>
		  <p><span class="nav"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></span></p>
		  <a name="Your Acceptance of these terms"></a> 
		  <h5>Your Acceptance of these terms</h5>
		  <p>By using this site, you signify your agreement to <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> and/or its affiliates’ sites following the posting changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.</p>
		  <p>This policy applies to <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> and other Web sites owned by <strong>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club</strong> or its affiliates are specifically linked to this Privacy Policy.</p>
