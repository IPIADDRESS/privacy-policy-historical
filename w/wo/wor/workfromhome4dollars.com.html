<p class="MsoNormal"><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b><br>
<br>
Last Updated: Aug 26, 2006<br>
<br>
workfromhome4dollars.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of
Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address,
street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy.
We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized
third party. Period."<br>
<br>
<b>How we gather information from users</b><br>
<br>
How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the
activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For
example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access
to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as
newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you
participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and
other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, workfromhome4dollars.com
also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools
that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of
your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and
hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your
user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information
each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a
particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional
technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain
cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by
setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable
to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user
name and password, and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features
according to your preferences.<br>
<br>
<b>What we do with the information we collect</b><br>
<br>
Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and
deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy
and do not share your information with anyone.<br>
<br>
Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be
used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage
patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our
site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features
are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with
our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include
any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify
you individually.<br>
<br>
We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
workfromhome4dollars.com to communicate with you about your registration and
customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services
and products offered by workfromhome4dollars.com and other topics we think you
might find of interest.<br>
<br>
Personally Identifiable Information collected by workfromhome4dollars.com may
also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site
administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,
administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you.
Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our
site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will
use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time
as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with
other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be
among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response
to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to
do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us,
and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or
necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure
in such cases.<br>
<br>
<b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b><br>
<br>
workfromhome4dollars.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to
respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties,
including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers
accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection
policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link
to, or view as part of a frame on a workfromhome4dollars.com page, certain
content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through
workfromhome4dollars.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information,
Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties.
workfromhome4dollars.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of such
third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third
parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third
party.<br>
<br>
While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties
may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your
preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our
advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the
advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement
before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by
third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.
workfromhome4dollars.com does not control the use of this technology by third
parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or
policies of such third parties.<br>
<br>
You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally
Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information
can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without
our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or
third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of
workfromhome4dollars.com and this policy.<br>
<br>
<b>Children</b><br>
<br>
workfromhome4dollars.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable
Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we
discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of
this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe
workfromhome4dollars.com has any information from or about anyone under 13,
please contact us at the address listed below.<br>

Changes to this Policy<br>
<br>
workfromhome4dollars.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time.
Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site
following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those
changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be
used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information
was collected.</p>
