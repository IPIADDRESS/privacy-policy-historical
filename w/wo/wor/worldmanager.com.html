<ol start="5">
<li><strong>How we may use and disclose your personal information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may <strong><u>use</u></strong> your personal information for:</p>
<ul>
<li>the primary purposes for which it was collected, such as those described in paragraph 4 above;</li>
<li>administering and responding to your enquiry or feedback about our products and/or services;</li>

</ul>
<p></p>
<p>We may <strong><u>disclose</u></strong> personal information we collect from you:</p>
<ul>
<li>to our related companies, suppliers, consultants, contractors or agents for the primary proposes for which it was collected or for other ancillary purposes directly related to the purpose for which the personal information is collected.

<li>for direct marketing by us but giving you the opportunity to opt out of such direct marketing;</li>
<li>to relevant Federal, State and Territory medical, health and safety authorities (as reasonably required);</li>
<li>where the law otherwise requires or authorises us to do so;</li>
<li>to others that you have been informed of at the time any personal information is collected from you;</li>
<li>to third parties with your consent (express or implied).</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>We do not disclose your personal information for any secondary purposes unless your consent has been given or as required by law, and we will not sell or license any personal information that we collect from you.</p>
<p></p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>How your personal information is stored and secured</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorised access by restricting access to the information in electronic format and by appropriate physical and communications security.</p>
<p>In the event of a data breach, such as the unauthorised loss, use or disclosure of personal information, we will assess and respond in line with our applicable policies and procedures, which incorporate the requirements contained in the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017. Pursuant to our obligations under the Privacy Act, we will notify you where your personal information is involved in an eligible data breach as defined in the NDB scheme laid down in the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 that is likely to result in serious harm. Such notification will also include making recommendations about the steps you should take in response to the breach. The Australian Information Commissioner (<strong>Commissioner</strong>) will also be notified of any eligible data breach where we have an obligation to inform the Commissioner.</p>
<p>We only keep your personal information for as long as it is required for the purpose for which it was collected or as otherwise required by law. We will take appropriate measures to destroy or permanently de-identify your personal information if the primary purpose is not applicable anymore and/or we no longer need to retain it for business purposes. These measures may vary depending on the type of information concerned, the way it was collected and how it was stored.</p>
<p></p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Using our Website and Cookies</strong></li>

<p>Our website uses “Cookies”. A cookie is a small file that stays on your computer until, depending on whether it is a sessional or persistent cookie, you turn your computer off or it expires. Cookies may collect and store your personal information. You may adjust your internet browser to disable cookies.

<p></p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Marketing and Opting-Out</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We will only send out marketing and communications to those persons registered as "Administrators" on an Account.</p>
<p>We may send out communications to Administrators for the purposes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>promoting and marketing our current and future products and services;</li>
<li>informing you of upcoming events and special promotions and offers; and</li>
<li>asking that you participate in analysing our products and services so as to improve and develop new products and services.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>We may disclose Administrator's personal information to our related entities so our related entities can assist in the marketing of our products and services to you.</p>
<p>We will only offer Administrators products or services where we reasonably believe that they could be of interest or benefit.</p>
<p>At the point we collect information from you, you may be asked to “opt in” in order to consent to us using or disclosing your personal information. You will be given the opportunity to “opt out” from receiving marketing communications from us. You may also “opt out” from receiving these communications by clicking on an unsubscribe link at the end of any marketing email you receive from us or by contacting us with this request at any time.</p>

<ol start="9">
<li><strong>Cross border disclosure</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your personal information may also be processed by, or disclosed to, employees, representatives, or other third parties operating outside of Australia who work for, or are engaged by us in connection with the primary purposes in paragraph 4 above, in other countries, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>United States of America; and/or</li>
<li>Canada (approved by the European Commission).</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, we may use a server hosted overseas in the abovementioned countries to store our data, which may include but not be limited to your personal information.</p>
<p>We will take reasonable steps, in these circumstances, before your personal information is disclosed to any entity operating overseas, to ensure that the overseas recipient observes and complies with the Australian Privacy Principles and does not knowingly breach any privacy laws to which they are bound in relation to your personal information which includes the Privacy Act and GDPR (‘the Reasonable Steps’).</p>
<p>The Reasonable Steps may not apply if you consent to the disclosure of your personal information to an overseas recipient and we reasonably believe that the overseas recipient is subject to laws that are suitability similar to privacy laws in Australia.</p>
<p>If you expressly consent to the disclosure of your personal information to an overseas recipient, the overseas recipient may not be accountable under the Privacy Act, and you may not be able to seek redress for breaches under the Privacy Act.</p>

<ol start="10">
<li><strong>Accurate and up-to-date information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We will ensure that every reasonable step is taken to ensure your personal information is accurate, up- to-date and not misleading by updating our records whenever true and correct changes to the data come to our attention.</p>
