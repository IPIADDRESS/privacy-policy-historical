The WNW Services uses three types of cookies: (1) session, (2) persistent cookies and (3) third-party cookies.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">&nbsp;- The session cookie is used to identify the type of user so that you may view the pages which correspond to your account type; Creative or Hirer. These disappear when you close your browser.<br><br>&nbsp;- Persistent or permanent cookies are used for the same purpose; to identify the type of user Creative or Hirer to the Website. However, these remain active for one (1) year unless you clear your browser and delete all cookies.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">&nbsp;- Third-Party Service Providers with whom we contract may also use their own third-party cookies. The use of these technologies by such third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this Privacy Policy, except as required by law.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>WNW does not use “tracking” cookies</b>, which follow users’ online activity between unrelated websites. WNW does work with a variety of Third-Party Websites that may use tracking cookies and other technologies that may track your activity and collect information across websites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, unless you have configured yours not to accept them. You can program your browser not to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to use certain portions of the Website and the Website will not be able to customize certain functions according to your preferences.&nbsp;</li>
