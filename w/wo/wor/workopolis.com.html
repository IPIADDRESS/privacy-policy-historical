                You can visit this Site without telling us who you are or revealing 
                any information about yourself, including your email address. 
                In this case, our Web server may collect the name, address, the 
                IP address and domain you used to access this Site, the type and 
                version of browser and operating system you are using, and the 
                web site you came from and visit next. This information is used 
                by us and our business partners to measure the number of visits, 
                average time spent, page views, and other statistics about visitors 
                to this Site in general. We may also use this data to monitor 
                site performance for systems administration purposes, to make 
                this Site easier and more convenient to use and to report information 
                in aggregate form to our advisers (e.g. how many visitors log 
                in to this Site). <br>
              </p>
              <p> <b>Cookies</b> <br>
                Cookies are small pieces of data stored by your Internet browser 
                on your computer's hard drive, which permits us to recognize you 
                when you access this Site. If you are browsing, a cookie is used 
                to help us measure the number of visits, average time spent, page

                If you are searching, a cookie is used to carry the search request 
                data from the request page to the results page. This cookie, by 
                itself, doesn't tell us your email address or who you are. If 
                you decide to register on-line with us, we may collect additional 
                information to provide tailored job opportunities or other information 
                to you (see Personal Information Collection below). In this case, 
                we use cookies to recognize you on subsequent visits and make

                USE AND DISTRIBUTION TO THIRD PARTIES</h3>
              <p> <b>Generally</b><br>
                There are times when we may ask you for or you may choose to provide 
                information about yourself or your business to assist us in meeting 
                your various needs. This information may be used for the following 
                purposes: answering your questions, providing you with services 
                you have requested, giving producers and developers of the Site 
                information that is useful in determining appropriate new features, 
                content and services, to provide advertisers with aggregate, not 
                individual, information about our customers, or informing you 
                of additional services or job opportunities provided by Workopolis 
                or by our business partners, that may interest you. </p>
              
<p>To provide these services, we may need to ask you directly to provide, among 
  other things, your name, mailing address, postal code, email address and phone 
  number ("Registration Information"). Workopolis is a partnership of 
  The Globe and Mail and The Toronto Star. As such, Workopolis is part of the 
  <a href="http://www.globeinteractive.com">Globe Interactive</a> or <a href="http://www.globeandmail.com">globeandmail.com</a> 
  family of web sites and services. Once you register with Workopolis you are 
  automatically registered for all other Globe Interactive services. Your Registration 
  Information may be shared, <i>for internal purposes only</i>, so that you do 
  not need to re-register with any services that require registration on Globe 
  Interactive sites. The Globe Interactive sites currently are as follows: <a href="http://www.globefund.com/">globefund.com</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.globeinvestor.com/">globeinvestor.com</a>, <a href="http://www.globebooks.com/">globebooks.com</a>,

  <a href="http://www.robtv.com">robtv.com</a>, <a href="http://www.robmagazine.com/">robmagazine.com</a> 
  and <a href="http://www.globetechnology.com/">globetechnology.com</a> (collectively 
  the "Globe Interactive Sites"). Each of the Globe Interactive Sites 
  has its own privacy policy, which may vary from that of Workopolis. We encourage 
  you to review the other Globe Interactive Sites' privacy policies to understand 
  their procedures for collecting, using and disclosing information. By registering 
  with Workopolis, you agree that your Registration Information may be shared 
  with the Globe Interactive Sites and used in accordance with their privacy policies. 
  If you do not wish your Registration Information to be shared with the other 
  Globe Interactive Sites, you should not register with Workopolis. What information 
  is shared? Your user name, password and postal code -- <b>not any of the personal 
  information</b> you supply when you add a resum√© to "My workopolis". 
  (please refer to our further <a href="#USE OF RESUMES">Privacy Policy with respect 
  to Resum√©s</a> for more information)</p>
              <p>You may also elect to apply on-line to a job posting or to purchase 
                one of our services, which may require us to gather additional 
                information for third parties (including credit information) to 
                determine your eligibility. At times, we also conduct on-line 
                surveys to better understand the needs, profiles, and experience 
                of our visitors. You will be given the option to participate in 
                such surveys. Unless you request to receive the results of the 
                survey via email, no personal information is requested during 
                such surveys and all information is used on an aggregated basis 
                only. If, during the registration process, you indicated you would 
                like us to keep you updated on new site developments, and information 
                about our services or about offerings from Workopolis and/or globeandmail.com 
                or Torstar Media group, we will send you these updates by email. 
                If you contact Workopolis we may keep a record of that correspondence. 
                We do not collect any email addresses of those who communicate 
                with Workopolis via email. We use the information provided only 
                so that we may respond to the email. </p>
              <p>We do not knowingly solicit information from children and we 
                do not knowingly market our services to children. </p>
              <p>When you provide information to us, we may communicate and disclose 
                your information to third parties for the purpose of fulfilling, 
                servicing and completing your requests and the transactions related 
                to it. These third parties may be in Canada or in other parts 
                of the world. </p>
              <p>We may also aggregate statistics that we gather about the visitors 
                to the Site, sales, traffic patterns, and services and provide 
                these statistics to third parties; however, when we do, these 
                statistics will not include any personal information that identifies 
                individuals. </p>
              <p>We may also use, disclose and communicate your personal information 
                if required to do so by law including by an order of any court.</p>
              <p>Although we use all reasonable means to ensure that the information 
                you provide to us is not used by third parties for purposes other 
                than those described in this Privacy Policy, Workopolis is not 
                responsible for any improper use of your personal information 
                that is beyond our reasonable control. <br>
              </p>
              <p><b>Resume Collection</b><br>
                As part of the services we provide, you may choose to provide 
                us with your resume, to be viewed by various organizations who 
                access this Website. In addition to the provisions of this Privacy 
                Policy, the collection, use and distribution of your resume is 
                governed by the terms set out at http://www.workopolis.com/content/home/terms.html 
              </p>
              <h3>HOW DO YOU ACCESS AND UPDATE<a name="ACCESS AND UPDATE"></a> 
                YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
              <p> Workopolis provides you with the means to access, update, edit 
                or delete the Registration Information you have provided to us 
                at any time on your own by going to <a href="http://www.workopolis.com">http://www.workopolis.com</a> 
                and changing or deleting the Registration Information contained 
                in My Workopolis as desired. If you decide at any time that you 
                do not want to receive any updates you have subscribed for just 
                send an email message to comments@workopolis.com, indicating your 
                preference not to receive updates. If you are unsure whether we 
                have a record containing your personal information and would like 
                to confirm whether or not we do, please send an email at comments@workopolis.com, 
                indicating all email addresses which you may have given us. <br>
              </p>
              <h3>HOW IS YOUR INFORMATION SECURED AND PROTECTED<a name="SECURED AND PROTECTED"></a>?</h3>
              <p> Where Workopolis considers it appropriate, Workopolis uses encryption 
                and/or authentication tools among other methods to protect certain 
                web-based personal information. E-mails you send us are not necessarily 
                secure when they are transmitted to us. If your communication 
                is sensitive or includes confidential information such as a credit 
                card number, you may want to provide it by post or via the telephone 
                instead. </p>
              <p>We work to protect the security of your credit card information 
                during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, 
                which encrypts information you input. We do not reveal any of 
                your credit card number when confirming an order. Of course, we 
                transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit 
                card company during order processing. </p>
              <p>We instruct our employees with access to your information that 
                it is to be used only in adherence with the principles set forth 
                in this Privacy Policy and the laws applicable to each specific 
                business. Employees who misuse customer information may be subject 
                to disciplinary action.</p>
              <h3>WHAT IF WE CHANGE OUR PRIVACY POLICY<a name="CHANGE OUR PRIVACY POLICY"></a>?</h3>
              <p> Workopolis reserves the right to modify or supplement this Privacy 
                Policy statement at any time. If we make any material change to 
                this Privacy Policy, we will update this Site to include such 
                changes and post a notice on our home page, for a period of 30

              <h3> CO-HOSTED<a name="CO-HOSTED"></a> WEBSITES</h3>
              <p> Workopolis has partnered with reputable third parties to offer 
                our customers a variety of services. Many of these services also 
                require registration to make them function properly. You can recognize 
                most of these sites if you see both organizations' names on the 
                Web page. For example, if you see a logo on the page that says 
                "Powered by ", you are on a co-hosted site. We also 
                have other third-party relationships, where the third party provides 
                the technology or service under the Workopolis name and Website. 
                In either of these cases, unless otherwise indicated at the registration 
                page, Workopolis does not provide your Registration Information 
                to its third party partners. Although we only work with reputable 
                third parties, our third party partners may have different privacy 
                policies and practices than Workopolis. We encourage you to review 
                our business partners' privacy policies further to understand 
                their procedures for collecting, using and disclosing information.</p>
              <h3> WEBSITE LINKS<a name="WEBSITE LINKS"></a></h3>
              <p> This Site may contain links to other sites, including those 
                of our business partners, vendors and advertisers. While we try 
                to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect 
                for privacy, please understand that we are not responsible for 
                the content of, or the privacy practices employed by, other sites.</p>
              <h3> ADDITIONAL<a name="ADDITIONAL"></a> PRIVACY PROCEDURES</h3>
              <p> Privacy procedures specific to certain services from Workopolis 
                can be found on our Site at the location of the particular services. 
                Those procedures are an addendum to this policy, and are provided 
                to you at the place where they will be of most use to you. </p>
              <h3>PRIVACY POLICY WITH RESPECT TO USE OF RESUMES<a name="USE OF RESUMES"></a></h3>
              <p> This policy applies in addition to Workopolis' general Privacy 
                Policy and applies to the use of your resume by Workopolis. As 
                part of the services Workopolis provides, you are able to post 
                your resume on our Website. Resumes are accessed by employers 
                ("Employers") who use your resume for internal job postings 
                and by recruiters ("Recruiters") who seek to find you 
                employment with third parties ("Third Parties"). You 
                will be provided with the choice of either allowing all organizations 
                who search workopolis.com's resume service to access your resume 
                and to contact you, or of limiting access to those organizations 
                to whom you chose to apply for a job. Workopolis restricts Employers 
                from using your resume other than for internal recruiting purposes, 
                and restricts Recruiters from disclosing your resume to Third 
                Parties other than for a specific job posting. Employers and Recruiters 
                are not permitted to disclose information outside their organization 
                or beyond the Third Party, as applicable. Recruiters are also 
                required to have entered into an agreement with Third Parties 
                which requires such Third Parties to use your resume solely for 
                the purpose of filling a job within the Third Party for which 
                the information was provided and not disclosing your Resume outside 
                the organization. However, although Workopolis deals only with 
                reputable organizations, we cannot guarantee that all Employers, 
                Recruiters and Third Parties will adhere to the limitations we 
                impose on them. If at any time you would like your resume removed 
                from our Website, this can be done by using the "delete my 
                resume" function located at www.workopolis\myworkopolis.com. 
                However, Employers and Recruiters who have paid to access the 
                resume database or for whose job posting you may have applied 
                to may have already retained a copy of your resume in their own 
                files and databases. </p>
              <p>Some job postings which are posted on the Workopolis Site allow 
                you to follow links to where you can apply, and provide your resume, 
                for a specific job posting. In some cases, such applications are 
                still within the Workopolis Site and its control, however, if 
                you are not asked to login using your workopolis.com Registration 
                User ID and password, then such application process, and your 
                resume are outside the Workopolis Site and Workopolis' control. 
                In such cases you will be providing your resume directly to the 
                Employer or Recruiter and your resume will be subject to their 
                privacy policy. Workopolis is not responsible for the privacy 
                practices of such Employer or Recruiter. In such cases, we encourage 
                you to review the Employer or Recruiter's privacy policy.</p>
              <p> Although we use all reasonable means to protect your personal 
                information, Workopolis is not responsible for any improper use 
                of your personal information that is beyond our reasonable control.</p>
              <h3>WE WANT YOUR FEEDBACK<a name="YOUR FEEDBACK"></a></h3>
              <p> In order to continually monitor and strengthen our privacy procedure, 
                we have on staff Laird Farquharson, a Privacy Manager who can 
                be contacted at <a href="mailto:privacy@workopolis.com">privacy@workopolis.com</a>. 
                Please contact the Privacy Manager if you have questions about 
                privacy and usage that were not answered here. We welcome any 
                suggestions about our Privacy Policy. </p><br>
