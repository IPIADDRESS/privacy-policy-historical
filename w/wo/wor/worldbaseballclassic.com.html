<strong>3. Additional Information About Collection of Location Data</strong>
</p>
<p>
Location Data We Collect. When you use our Services we may solicit your permission to collect your location data. Please be advised, for some features within our Applications to function (e.g., live video) we may be required to confirm your current location and therefore some features may not be available if you choose not to provide your location data to us. The specificity of the location data collected may depend on a number of factors, including the device you are using (e.g., laptop, smartphone, tablet) and how you are connected to the internet (e.g., via cable broadband connection, WiFi, etc.). If you enable location services for our Applications, we may collect location data (e.g., zip code) periodically as you use or leave open our Applications. We may also use this data internally or in conjunction with our third-party service providers to customize your experience and provide offers that may be relevant to you. Depending on the platform you use to access our Applications (e.g., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) you may be able to control from within the settings on your wireless device or the Application(s) whether location data is collected.

When using our Services or when using certain third-party social networking services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Google +) (each and collectively, a "Social Network"), you may have the option to connect your Website or Application information and activity with your Social Network information and activity. If you authorize such a connection, you permit us to share or publish information about your activity on our Services with that Social Network and its users, and to access certain of your Social Network information, as disclosed by you at the time you consent to the connection.

<em>Special Rules For Children. </em>
</p>
<p>
Because of federal law, we are not permitted to knowingly collect any personal information from a child under the age of thirteen without the consent of that child's parent or guardian. The statements in this Privacy Policy about our collection and use of personal information also apply to our treatment of personal information from children under the age of thirteen. Some elements of our Services (e.g., shop, ticketing, and auctions) require the submission of a payment card number along with personal information in connection with a purchase; other elements of our Services (e.g., fantasy baseball) require the submission of personal information to access or use the Services. Except in certain cases where limited contact information may be collected and not retained, these elements of our Services are not available to children under the age of thirteen. If a child who we know to be under the age of thirteen and for whom we have not received parental consent attempts to utilize a service on our Services which is not available to children, he/she will not be able to access it and may receive a message which relays that he/she is not eligible for such feature.
