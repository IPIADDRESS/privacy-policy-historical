<div class="hl">Privacy Statement</div>

<p>MLB Advanced Media, L.P. is the organization that produces the
Official Website of the World Baseball Classic (the "Website"). We are
committed to safeguarding your privacy online. This Privacy Policy is
applicable to this Website.</p>

<p><b>General</b></p>

<p>You can visit and enjoy our Website without disclosing any personal
information about yourself. However, we offer some special services,
and for these services to work properly we will need you to share with
us certain personal information about yourself. The personal
information we collect may include, but is not limited to, first and
last name, street address, e-mail address, telephone number (e.g.,
home, work, mobile and/or fax), and birthdate.  We may also collect
other personal information that will be identified on the applicable
page(s) of the Website.  If you submit any personal information to us,
or to our third party service providers acting on our behalf, you can
be assured that we will not sell, lease, or share your personal
information with or to anyone else, except as follows: (1) to our
third party service providers, and only so that they may help us
provide the services you've requested and in certain circumstances to
provide you with ticket related offers; (2) to one or more Major
League Baseball Clubs, to the extent that you've submitted information
that relates specifically to them (e.g., you've asked to receive the
newsletter of one or more Clubs via email; or you've purchased
Club-specific merchandise from the store), so that they may learn more
about fans like you, and provide better services to you; (3) upon
notice posted on an applicable location of our Website where we
collect your personal information for an economic transaction and
notify you that we will be sharing such information with a third party
(i.e., ESPN.com), where such third party is clearly identified; and
(4) on occasion, we may offer a special promotion (such as a
sweepstakes, contest, fantasy baseball or a free subscription to goods
and services) on the Website in conjunction with a third party service
provider, sponsor or promotional partner, and share your information
with that sponsor or promotional partner so that it can send you other
special promotions it offers, but only if you give us permission to do
so.</p>

<p><em>Special Offers and Promotions.</em> With your permission, we
may also send you e-mails with special offers and promotions. If you
don't want to receive these, you may change your preferences.</p>

<p><em>Information Automatically Collected.</em> We use automatic
methods such as cookies (small amounts of data, which often includes
an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a
Website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive) and
single-pixel GIF images alone or in combination with personally
identifiable information you choose to provide us, to make our Website
work better, to understand Website usage and trends, deliver a more
personalized experience and to improve our content and offerings.
Examples of the information we collect and analyze using such methods
include, without limitation, the Internet protocol (IP) address used
to connect your computer to the Internet; e-mail address; login name
and password; type and version, operating system, and platform;
purchase history, which we may aggregate with similar information from
other customers; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream
to, on, and from our Website, including date and time; cookie
information; products you viewed or searched for; and your purchase
history. We may also use software tools to measure and collect session
information, including page response times, download errors, length of
visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as
scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away
from the page.</p>

<p>We may use also to enable you to use a "shopping cart" if you want
to purchase goods or services while on our Website, and to offer you
products, programs, or services based on purchase and Website usage
behavior that you and/or other customers have exhibited.  If you do
not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a
simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to accept or
reject cookies. If you set your browser not to accept cookies, you may
not be able to take advantage of certain services on our Website.</p>

<p>We do not transfer cookies associated with our Website to any other
company, nor do we authorize any other company to access the cookies
we have placed on your computer's hard drive.  We may allow other
companies that are presenting advertisements or providing services on
our pages to set and access cookies on your computer. Those companies'
use of cookies will be covered by their own privacy policies, not
ours.</p>

<p>We do not install any spyware or adware in connection with our
Website, or distribute any commercial message, or authorize any third
party to distribute any commercial message, by means of spyware or
adware.  "Spyware" or "adware" is any software which has been
downloaded to and/or installed on an Internet user's computer, without
the user's actual consent, and facilitates the distribution of any
commercial message to the user.  If you feel you may have spyware from
another company installed on your machine, there are various
anti-spyware/adware software applications available on the Internet to
identify if this has occurred.

</p><p>We use a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you
visit certain pages of our Website. This company may use aggregated
information (not including your name, address, email address or
telephone number) about your visits to our Website in order to provide
advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you
would like more information about the information collection practices
of this third-party advertising company, <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Aggregated Demographic Information.</em> We may share
aggregated demographic information with third parties, but this
information is not linked to any personal information that can
identify you or another individual person. Therefore, no personal
information is disclosed in this manner.</p>

<p><em>Business Transfers.</em> As time passes, MLB Advanced Media,
L.P. may be sold along with its assets, or other transactions may
occur in which customer information is one of the business assets
transferred. In such a case, the customer information which we have
gathered may be one of the business assets we transfer.</p>

<p><em>Disclosure for Legal Purposes.</em> The law requires that we
may be required to share your personal information and non-personal
information (see "Cookies" section above for examples of non-personal
information) pursuant to judicial or governmental subpoenas, warrants
or orders. If we are required to do so, we will, of course, obey the
law. In addition, notwithstanding any term to the contrary in this
Privacy Policy, we reserve the right to use and disclose share your
personal and non-personal information in order to investigate,
prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,
situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any
person, violations of this Website's Terms of Use, or as otherwise
required by law.</p>

<p><b>Our Security Practices</b></p>

<p>Your <a href="https://secure.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/account/index.jsp" target="_blank">preferences</a> are password protected for your
privacy and security. In certain areas, we use industry-standard SSL
encryption to protect data transmissions.</p>

<p><b>How You Can Review Your Personal Information</b></p>

<p>If you want to review or revise the personal information you
provided during registration on the Website, and whether you want to
receive communications from us, you can either (1) <a href="https://secure.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/account/index.jsp" target="_blank">click here to log in</a>, and then click on the
applicable menu option on the left side of the page, or (2) call
MLB.com Customer Service at 866-800-1275.  If you want to close your
account with us and have us delete the personal information in it
(except for information that we keep for record-keeping purposes), you

<p><b>Choice</b></p>

<p>Our registration and order forms contain a box for you to indicate
whether or not you consent to receive special offers and promotions
from us. Unless you give us your consent to use your personal
information for these purposes, we and our partners will only use it
to complete the transaction or provide the service or product you have
requested. If you indicate that you consent to receive communications
or solicitations, but you later change your mind, you can revise your
<a href="https://secure.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/account/index.jsp" target="_blank">preferences</a>.</p>

<p><b>Links</b></p>

<p>Our Website contains links to other sites produced by MLB Advanced
Media, L.P. and websites operated by unrelated third parties. Please
note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of third
party websites. We encourage you to be aware of this when your leave
our Website and to read the privacy policies of every website that
collects personally identifiable information from you. The Privacy
Policy applies only to this Website.</p>

<p><b>Special Rules For Children</b></p>

<p>Because of federal law, we cannot collect any personal information
from a child under the age of thirteen without the consent of that
child's parent. The statements in this Privacy Policy generally about
our collection and use of personal information also apply to our
treatment of personal information from children under the age of
thirteen, with the added protection of the special rules that
follow.</p>

<p><b>Parental Consent</b></p>

<p>Some services on the Website (e.g., Shop, Ticketing, Auctions)
require the submission of a credit card number along with personal
information, and are therefore not available to children. Other
services on the Website (e.g., fantasy baseball) are not available to
children under the age of thirteen. For services that are available to
children under the age of thirteen, if a child under the age of
thirteen attempts to complete any registration form on the Website a
screen will appear that says "Get Your Mom or Dad." We will then
instruct the child to have a parent complete the registration form,
either in person or by e-mail. We will provide the parent with a
notice describing the Privacy Policy and will ask for the parent's
consent to our collection and use of personal information from or
about their child. The parent will also be asked to submit a credit
card number (the card will not be charged) for verification purposes
only.</p>

<p>If the registration form is not completed with a credit card number
to verify parental consent, the child will not be able to access those
of our activities requiring registration and we will not collect any
personal information from that child. Failure to complete the
registration form will also prevent the child from entering chat rooms
or otherwise making personal information available to the public on
the Website. A child's parent has the option to consent to the
collection and use of their child's personal information without
consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties, but
if such disclosure is necessary to make available a service which has
been requested, then the child will not have access to such
service.</p>

<blockquote> <p><em>Information Collected.</em> Depending on the
special service requested, personal information collected may include
a name, email address, address or age of a child. We will not
condition a child's participation in any activity on the Website, such
as fantasy baseball, on the child's disclosing more information than
is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.</p>

<p>A parent can review his or her child's personal information by
accessing the child's preferences. A parent can instruct us to delete
the child's personal information or to stop collecting or using the
child's personal information by contacting the <a href="#pa">Privacy
Administrator</a>.</p>

<p><em>Information Use.</em> We may use the personal information to
provide the child with the special services for which he or she has
registered, as well as for fulfilling a requested transaction, record
keeping, marketing back to the child or making it publicly available
through a chat room. (Please note that when anyone, including a child,
uses a message board or chat room on our Website, the communications
are publicly available to the other participants.)</p>

<p><em>Information Disclosure.</em> After obtaining the consent of the
child's parent, we, our service providers, and one or more Clubs (to
the extent that any information disclosed is specific to them), will
maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal
information collected about the child. A child's information will only
be disclosed to our third party service providers and the applicable
Club(s) as described in this Privacy Policy. The following are third
party service providers of our services which may collect or maintain
personal information from children under 13 on our behalf: Synacor,
Inc. (vanity e-mail); and Prospero, Inc. (message boards and GameDay
chat). They can't use your child's personal information without your
consent for any purpose other than the service you've requested on
behalf of your child.</p> </blockquote>
