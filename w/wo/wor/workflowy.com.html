    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Effective Date: May 10, 2016</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      WorkFlowy, Inc. values the privacy of our users and makes all

      personal information is collected.
    </p>
    <p>

	<li>
	  Aggregate information from multiple users without personally
	  identifying individuals, such as geographic region, which we
	  may share with our partners business to improve
	  understanding of customer needs and provide relevant
	  services.
	</li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      You may elect to terminate your participation in the services at
      any time and/or delete information and material you have entered
      in WorkFlowy. If you cancel your account, or delete any
      WorkFlowy content, it will no longer be accessible to you or
      others who may access the service, but there may continue to be
      residual copies of such information due to the nature of the
      computer system's operation and ongoing data back-up and
      archiving.
    </p>

    <h2>Public information</h2>
    <p>
      Certain portions of the WorkFlowy web sites and services are
      open to any online viewer, such as lists designated as "public."
      Any information that you post in these locations can be read,
      collected and used by anyone, and could enable others to send
      you unsolicited messages. WorkFlowy enables you to determine
      whether or not to post personal or otherwise sensitive
      information to publically accessible areas of our site, and so
      you should carefully consider how you use the
      services. WorkFlowy is not responsible for any publication or
      use of any personal information you choose to post in these
      locations.
    </p>

    <h2>Information disclosure to third parties</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share, sell, rent or otherwise distribute information
      you enter in WorkFlowy to others, except as disclosed in this
      Privacy Policy. WorkFlowy may share your information with others
      outside of WorkFlowy under the following circumstances:
      </p><ul>
	<li>
	  We have your explicit consent to share the information;
	</li>

	  information is reasonably necessary in order to meet any applicable law,
    regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; or
	</li>
	<li>
	  We believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent
	  or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud
	  or potential threats against persons or property.
	</li>
      </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    We will notify users of government requests
    for their data, unless legally barred from doing so.
  </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies are small data files that a web site you visit may save
      on your hard drive that usually includes an anonymous unique
      identifier. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your
      hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your e-mail
      address. The WorkFlowy web site uses cookies for user
      authentication, keeping track of your preferences, promotional
      campaigns that require user identification, keeping track of our
      audience size and traffic patterns, and in certain other cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can configure your browser to accept cookies, reject cookies
      or notify you when a cookie is being used. However, if you
      configure your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to
      use WorkFlowy products or services that require you to sign in
      or take advantage of all the features of WorkFlowy.
    </p>
    <p>
      WorkFlowy may allow third party business partners that display
      advertisements on some of our web pages to maintain their own
      cookies on your computer. These business partners do not have
      access to WorkFlowy's cookies and their use is subject to their
      own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>
      The WorkFlowy web site and services may contain links to other
      sites. WorkFlowy is not responsible for the privacy policy or
      other practices employed by web sites linked to, or from, our
      web site nor the information or content contained therein. This
      privacy statement applies solely to information collected by
      this web site.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Ownership</h2>
    <p>
      You own the data you put into WorkFlowy. By putting your
      information into WorkFlowy, you do not grant WorkFlowy any
      special rights with regard to that information.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      WorkFlowy is committed to protecting the security of your
      information and takes reasonable precautions to protect it.
      Data transmissions for WorkFlowy users are protected by SSL
      encryption by default, the same technology used by thousands of
      leading online services such as banks, email providers and
      remote backup services. However, Internet data transmissions,
      whether wired or wireless, cannot be guaranteed to be 100%
      secure and as a result we cannot give a 100% guarantee of the
      security of information you transmit to us; accordingly, you
      acknowledge that you do so at your own risk. Once we receive
      your data transmission, we make all commercially reasonable
      efforts to ensure its security on our systems:
      </p><ul>
	<li>
    Your data is encrypted at rest in our database and
    in all backups we create.
	</li>
  <li>
    Your WorkFlowy password is protected by encryption and only
    you have access to it;
  </li>
	<li>
	  Your personal information and data stored in our systems is
	  protected by various physical, electronic and procedural
	  safeguards.
  </li>
  <li>
    As a rule, WorkFlowy employees do not monitor or
	  view your personal information or content stored in the
	  WorkFlowy service, but it may be viewed if we learn that our
	  Terms of Service may have been violated and confirmation is
	  required, or we otherwise determine that we have an
	  obligation to review it; and
	</li>
	<li>
	  The WorkFlowy service uses standard SSL
	  encryption to protect data transmissions. However, this is
	  not a guarantee that such data transmissions cannot be
	  accessed, altered or deleted due to firewall or other
	  security software failures.
	</li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      If WorkFlowy learns of a security system breach we may attempt
      to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if
      available, through the e-mail address that you supplied during
      registration or posting a notice on our web site. Depending on
      where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such
      notices in writing. To request written notice of any security
      breach in writing, please send an e-mail with your request and
      mailing address to help AT workflowy.com.
    </p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      WorkFlowy complies with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
      Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which requires
      us to inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect,
      use and disclose personal information from children under 13
      years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      WorkFlowy is not currently directed to children. We will not
      knowingly collect personal information relating to children
      under 13 years of age, and if we learn that we have
      inadvertently done so, we will promptly delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>
      Personal information collected on this web site may be stored
      and processed in the United States or any other country in which
      WorkFlowy maintains facilities, and by using this web site, you
      consent to any such transfer of information outside of your
      country.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes and Updates</h2>
    <p>
      As this Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time, we will
      revise and display the effective date at the top of the web
      page. You should periodically review it to keep abreast of our
      plans and procedures to protect the personal information that we
      collect. Your continued use of the WorkFlowy services
      constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any
      updates.
    </p>
    <p>
      If WorkFlowy should ever sell its assets, merge with another
      entity or file for bankruptcy, information collected from this
      web site and in the operation of the services may be transferred
      as assets of WorkFlowy.
