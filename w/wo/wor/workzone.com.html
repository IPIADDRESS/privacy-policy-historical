                    	<h1>WorkZone Security</h1>
				<p>We know that security is crucial to you, and it's our top priority. WorkZone exercises great care to secure your company's 
				confidential information. WorkZone uses multi-layered security to protect your data, and we are continuously engaged in examining 
				and updating security as we update our service.</p>
				<p>Internally, we restrict access to all confidential personal and company  information to employees who need access to the 
				information in order to do  their jobs. These employees are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy and security 
				policies. All such employees execute comprehensive nondisclosure agreements, which provide explicit confidentiality protections. 
				Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution.</p>
				<p>We do not reveal any personally identifiable information that we collect about you, your use of WorkZone or any information that 
				you post to anyone else. We will not sell, rent or release any personal or company information to any other party without your 
				explicit consent, unless required by law.</p>
				<h2>Our Security and Monitoring  Measures</h2>
				<p>We provide state-of-the-art  security to protect your personal and company information. We devote  significant resources to continually develop and enhance the security of  WorkZone and your information.</p>
                        <p><b>Physical Security</b><br>
				Our secure hosting facility is equipped with state-of-the-art security  features. Access to the servers requires a security badge, PIN number, and  sign-in at the front desk. The facility has extensive 24/7 video surveillance  and a monitored alarm system. In addition, a key is required to access a locked  cabinet that houses the password-protected servers.</p>
				<p><b>Firewall and Monitoring</b><br>
				WorkZone employs a highly-secure firewall that blocks all outside access to the  servers except for HTTP, HTTPS and SSH. Public SMTP is blocked, so email  viruses cannot propagate through our network. Public FTP is also blocked so it  cannot be compromised.</p>
				<p>The servers on which WorkZone sites reside are continuously monitored for  attempted network attacks on a 24 x 7 basis, using sophisticated software  tools.</p>
				<p><b>Operating System Security</b><br>
				WorkZone enforces tight operating system-level security by using a minimal  number of access points to all production servers. We protect all system  accounts with passwords and follow best practices for periodically modifying  them. All operating systems and applications are maintained at each vendor's  recommended patch levels for security.</p>
				<p><b>Application security</b><br>
				All data transmissions are protected via 256-bit financial-grade encryption.  The lock icon in the browser indicates that your data is fully secure while in  transit over the internet.</p>
				<p>Each WorkZone user must log-in with individual user IDs and passwords. When you  enter your password to log into WorkZone, your password is encrypted as it  travels across the internet, so it cannot be intercepted.</p>
				<p>Folders and individual files can be locked (hidden), so that only authorized  users can view specific information. Additionally, each user is assigned a  specific "role" which defines his/her level of authority within the  system.</p>
				<p><b>System Redundancy</b><br>
				The WorkZone system is designed for 24x7x365 operation. It features built-in  redundancy, including redundant access to multiple Internet backbones,  redundant power protection via both battery backup and a high power emergency  generator, and a sophisticated climate control system.</p>
				<p><b>Backup</b><br>
				All customer data is automatically backed up hourly, and stored at a secure,  off-site facility. </p>
				<p><b>Contacting WorkZone</b><br>
				If you have any questions about WorkZone security or privacy procedures, please contact us.</p>				<p>WorkZone Customer Service<br>
