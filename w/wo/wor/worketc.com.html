<h2><font size="4">Data Collection</font></h2>

<p>Veetro undertakes to collect Your Data by means that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>fair; 
</li>
<li>legal; and 
</li>
<li>transparent. </li></ul>

<p>If you visit Veetro's web site, your web browser automatically discloses, and 
Veetro's web server automatically logs, the following information: the date and 
time, the IP address from which you issued the request, the type of browser and 
operating system you are using, the URL of any page that referred you to the 
page, the URL you requested, and whether your request was successful. This data 
may or may not be sufficient to identify you.</p>

<p>Any additional data that you provide, e.g. in a web form, may also be logged. 
This data may or may not be sufficient to identify you.</p>

<p>Any additional data that your web browser automatically provides may also be 
logged. This will be the case, for example, if your browser has previously been 
requested to store data on your computer in 'cookies' and submits them each time 
you request a web-page within a particular domain (such as veetro.com.au). This 
data may or may not be sufficient to identify you.</p>

<p>If you disclose personal data to Veetro in conjunction with an identifier 
such as your name or your credit-card details, Veetro will collect Your Data. 
Moreover, any data that becomes available to Veetro through any of the means 
described in the preceding paragraphs may be able to be associated with that 
identifier, and hence become Your Data.</p>

<p>Subject to the qualifications immediately below, Veetro undertakes to collect 
Your Data from you and not from other parties. This undertaking is qualified as 
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>where Veetro reasonably considers that the protection of its financial 
interests requires that it gather Your Data from other sources, or from 
additional sources. This applies in particular where Veetro has a lending 
exposure to you, and seeks information about your creditworthiness; 
</li>
<li>where Veetro reasonably considers that its capability to deliver quality 
services to you will be materially enhanced by gathering Your Data from other 
sources. This applies in particular to consumer profile data. </li></ul>

<p>Where Veetro collects Your Data from sources other than you, it 
undertakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>to do so only by legal means; 
</li>
<li>to do so only with your consent; and 
</li>
<li>to declare to you what sources it uses, and under what circumstances. 
</li></ul>

<p>Veetro undertakes to declare the purpose of collection in a manner that is 
clear and meaningful, and to avoid vague, highly inclusive statements such as 
'to support our operations'.<br></p>
<h2>Data Security</h2>

<p>Veetro undertakes to store Your Data in a manner that ensures security 
against unauthorised access, alteration or deletion, at a level commensurate 
with its sensitivity.</p>

<p>Veetro undertakes to store Your Data only in jurisdictions where data 
protections are at least equivalent to those required under the OECD 
Guidelines.</p>

<p>Veetro undertakes to transmit Your Data in a manner that ensures security 
against unauthorised access, alteration or deletion, at a level commensurate 
with its sensitivity.</p>

<p>Veetro undertakes to implement appropriate measures to ensure security of 
Your Data against inappropriate behaviour by Veetro's staff-members and 
contractors. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>training for staff in relation to privacy; 
</li>
<li>access control, to limit access to Your Data to those staff and contractors 
who have legitimate reasons to access it; 
</li>
<li>particularly in the case of sensitive data, audit trails of accesses, 
including the identities of staff and contractors accessing the data; 
</li>
<li>reminders to staff and contractors from time to time about the importance of 
data privacy, and the consequences of inappropriate behaviour, 
</li>
<li>declaration of appropriately strong sanctions that are to be applied in the 
event of inappropriate behaviour 
</li>
<li>clear communication of policies and sanctions; and 
</li>
<li>processes to audit, to investigate and to impose sanctions.<br></li></ul>
<h2>Data Use</h2>

<p>Use refers to the application of Your Data by any part of Veetro, or any 
staff-member or contractor of Veetro in the course of their work.</p>

<p>Veetro undertakes to use Your Data only for:</p>
<ul>
<li>the purposes for which it was collected; 
</li>
<li>such other purposes as are subsequently agreed between Veetro and You; 
</li>
<li>such additional purposes as may be required by law. In these circumstances, 
Veetro will take any reasonable steps available to it to communicate to You that 
the use has occurred, unless it is precluded from doing so by law; and 
</li>
<li>such additional purposes as are authorised by law (in particular to protect 
Veetro's interests, e.g. if it believes on reasonable grounds that You have 
failed to fulfil your undertakings to Veetro or have committed a breach of the 
criminal law). </li></ul>

<p>Veetro undertakes to use Your Data only if it has demonstrable relevance to 
the particular use to which it is being put.</p>

<p>Veetro undertakes to use Your Data in such a manner as to take into account 
the possibility that it is not of sufficient quality for the purpose, e.g. 
because it is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, or 
out-of-context.<br></p>
<h2>Data Disclosure</h2><span class="sectionbody">

<p>Disclosure refers to making Your Data available to any party other than 
Veetro and You. The term disclosure may include many different conditions of 
data transfer, including selling, renting, trading, sharing and giving.</p>

<p>Veetro undertakes to disclose Your Data only under the following 
circumstances:</p></span>
<ul>
<li><span class="sectionbody">in the course of business being conducted between 
You and Veetro, where disclosure is necessary to a contractor, such as a 
transport company. Where Your Data is disclosed in this way, Veetro undertakes 
to exercise control over Veetro's contractors to ensure that their actions are 
compliant with these Terms;</span> 
</li>
<li><span class="sectionbody">in other circumstances that are directly implied by 
the purpose agreed between You and Veetro at the time of data collection or 
subsequently, where Your Data is disclosed in this way, Veetro undertakes to 
exercise control over Veetro's contractors to ensure that their actions are 
compliant with these Terms;</span> 
</li>
<li><span class="sectionbody">with your consent, or at your request;</span> 
</li>
<li><span class="sectionbody">where required by law, such as a provision of a 
statute, or a court order such as a search warrant or subpoena. In these 
circumstances, Veetro will take any reasonable steps available to it to 
communicate to You that the disclosure has occurred, unless it is precluded from 
doing so by law;</span> 
</li>
<li><span class="sectionbody"><span>where permitted by law (e.g. the <a href="http://www.worketc.com/Features/Management_Reports" class="autoLink" title="Management reports for your small business">reporting</a> of 
suspected breach of the criminal law to a law enforcement agency; and in an 
emergency, where Veetro believes on reasonable grounds that the disclosure of 
Your Data will materially assist in the protection or the life of health of some 
person), provided that Veetro will apply due diligence to ensure that the 
exercise of the permission is justifiable. </span></span></li></ul><span class="sectionbody">

<p>In all cases, Veetro undertakes to disclose only such of Your Data as is 
necessary in the particular circumstances.<br></p></span>
<h2>Data Retention and Destruction</h2><span class="sectionbody">

<p>Subject to the qualifications immediately below, Veetro 
undertakes:</p></span>
<ul>
<li><span class="sectionbody">to retain Your Data only as long as is consistent 
with its purpose; and</span> 
</li>
<li><span class="sectionbody">to destroy Your Data when its purpose has expired, 
and to do so in such a manner that Your Data is not subsequently capable of 
being recovered. </span></li></ul><span class="sectionbody">

<p>This undertaking is qualified as follows:</p></span>
<ul>
<li><span class="sectionbody">Your Data may be retained in Veetro's logs, backups 
and audit trails within short-term retention cycles that are devised to protect 
the company's operations. In such cases, Your Data will be destroyed in 
accordance with those cycles;</span> 
</li>
<li><span class="sectionbody">Your Data may be retained beyond the expiry of its 
purpose if that is required by law, such as a provision of a statute, or a court 
order such as a search warrant or sub poena, or a warning by a law enforcement 
agency that delivery of a court order is imminent. In these circumstances, 
Veetro will take any reasonable steps available to it to communicate to You that 
Your Data is being retained, unless it is precluded from doing so by law; 
and&nbsp;will only retain Your Data while that provision is current, and will then 
destroy Your Data; </span>
</li>
<li><span class="sectionbody">Your Data may be retained beyond the expiry of its 
purpose if it is authorised by law (in particular to protect Veetro's interests, 
e.g. if it believes on reasonable grounds that You have failed to fulfil your 
undertakings to Veetro or have committed a breach of the criminal law). In these 
circumstances, Veetro will only retain Your Data while that situation is 
current, and will then destroy Your Data. <br></span></li></ul>
<h2>Access by You to Your Personal Data</h2><span class="sectionbody">

<p>Veetro undertakes to provide you with access to Your Data, subject to only 
such conditions and processes as are reasonable in the circumstances. In 
particular, Veetro undertakes to enable access:</p></span>
<ul>
<li><span class="sectionbody">conveniently;</span> 
</li>
<li><span class="sectionbody">without unreasonable delay; and</span> 
</li>
<li><span class="sectionbody">without cost. </span></li></ul><span class="sectionbody">

<p>Veetro undertakes to establish and operate identity authentication 
protections for access to Your Data that are appropriate to its sensitivity, but 
practical. This may involve some inconvenience; for example, relatively 
straightforward procedures may be involved in order to provide you with access 
through a channel that you have previously registered with Veetro (such as a 
particular email address), but may impose more onerous procedures if you wish to 
use some other channel.</p>

<p>In the event that you dispute some aspect of Your Data, Veetro undertakes to 
take reasonable steps in relation to the amendment, supplementation or deletion 
of Your Data.</p>

<p>You undertake:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * not to seek access for frivolous purposes, or unreasonably 
frequently;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to accept that deletion of some data may not be consistent 
with the provision of particular services by Veetro to you.<br></p></span>
<h2>Information about Data-Handling Practices</h2><span class="sectionbody">

<p>Veetro undertakes to make information available to you about the manner in 
which Veetro handles your data:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * in general terms, in a readily accessible manner; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * in more 
specific terms, on request. </p>

<p>Where Your Data is disclosed to a contractor, Veetro undertakes to make 
information available to you on request about the manner in which Veetro's 
contractors handle your data.</p>

<p>Veetro undertakes to ensure that the information provided is meaningful, and 
addresses your concerns.</p>

<p>You undertake:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * not to seek such information for frivolous purposes, or unreasonably 
frequently; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to accept that the disclosure of excessive detail may 
harm the security of Your Data and Veetro's business processes, and may harm 
Veetro's commercial interests.</p>

<p><br></p></span>
<h2>Handling of Enquiries, General Concerns and Complaints</h2><span class="sectionbody">

<p>If you have enquiries, general concerns, or complaints about these Terms, or 
about Veetro's behaviour in relation to these Terms, you undertake:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to communicate them in the first instance:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - to Veetro 
only;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - in sufficient detail;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - through a channel 
made available by Veetro for that purpose; </p>

<p>Veetro undertakes:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to provide one or more channels for communications to Veetro, which are 
convenient to users;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to promptly provide acknowledgement of the receipt 
of communications, including the provision of a copy of the communication, the 
date and time it was registered, and Veetro's reference-code for the 
communication;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to promptly provide a response to the communication, in 
an appropriate and meaningful manner. </p>

<p>You further undertake to not pursue Veetro through any Regulator or the 
media:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * until and unless Veetro has had a reasonable opportunity to respond to 
the initial communication; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * while Veetro and you remain are 
conducting a meaningful dialogue about the matter.</p>

<p><br></p></span>
<h2>Enforcement</h2><span class="sectionbody">

<p>Veetro declares that its undertakings in these Terms are intended to create 
legal obligations, and that those obligations are intended to be enforceable 
under appropriate laws in appropriate jurisdictions. These include laws relating 
to data protection, privacy, fair trading, corporations and criminal laws.</p>

<p>You undertake to seek enforcement only in a jurisdiction that is relevant to 
the transactions that have taken place between You and Veetro, in particular the 
jurisdiction in which you live or in which you performed the relevant acts, and 
the jurisdiction in which Veetro is domiciled or performed the relevant 
acts.</p>

<h2>Changes to These Privacy Undertakings</h2><span class="sectionbody">

<p>Veetro undertakes:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * not to materially change these Terms in a manner that reduces the 
protections for Your Data;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to take all possible steps to prevent any 
company that acquires this company or any of its relevant assets from materially 
changing the Terms applicable to Your Data in a manner that reduces the 
protections for Your Data;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * where it is considering making changes to 
these Terms, or creating more specific Terms relating to specific services, to 
consult with appropriate representative and advocacy organisations;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 
where it makes changes to these Terms, to ensure that the differences between 
successive versions are readily accessible;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to maintain all prior 
versions of these Terms in such a manner that they are dated, and readily 
accessible.</p>
