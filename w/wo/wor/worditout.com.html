<p>
Enideo believes strongly in protecting the privacy of the information you share with us. We also believe that it is important to inform you about how we will use such information. Therefore, we encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully. This Privacy Policy applies to any information you provide to us by using this Website.
</p>
<p>
When you visit our Website, we may collect anonymous information to administer the Website and analyse its usage. We can also learn and improve the user experience of our Website and it may also allow us to provide personalised content and services for you. We do not collect information about the specifics of who you are (“Personally Identifiable Information“) unless you specifically provide to us this personal data.
</p>

<h2>1. Anonymous information</h2>
<p>None of the information in this section is Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

<h3>1.1 Web server logs</h3>
<p>
As when you visit almost all websites, web servers automatically log information. Examples of information we may track include, but are not limited to: your Internet protocol address; the kind of browser or computer you use; links you click within the site; date and time of your visit; web pages from which you link to our site; pages you view on our site. This information is not used to develop a personal profile of you and the log files are regularly purged.
</p>

<h3>1.2 Cookies</h3>
<p>
Like many websites, we may send cookies, a small text file, to your computer. As an example, the type of information that might be stored in a cookie could be a randomly assigned, anonymous identification number.
</p>
<p>
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this may disable some of the functionality of this Website.
</p>

<h2>2. Personal data you provide</h2>
<p>
Sometimes we may request you to provide some personal data, such as your email address. We do this so that we can identify who created the User Content as we may need to contact you about it. For example, we may have to contact you to provide you with a unique URL in order to to manage your User Content or to notify you that a particular service you use has been changed or suspended.
</p>
<p>
You might provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us in other circumstances too, such as when you send us email messages or submit forms on this Website. You may also be asked to disclose personal data to us so that we can provide assistance to you; for example, such data may be warranted in order to provide technical support and troubleshooting.
</p>

<h2>3. Managing your personal data</h2>
<p>
You should inform us if you wish to update your personal data, such as your email address. You may ask to have your personal data deleted or removed at any time, or do this yourself with the Secret Link provided to you by email. You have the right to review the information we have about you by sending us using the 'Contact us' form below. A small administration fee may be charged to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.
</p>

<h2>4. Sharing information</h2>
<p>
Enideo will keep your Personally Identifiable Information confidential except with your permission or under special circumstances, including: when required by law; to fulfill your service request. We may transfer, sell or assign any of the information described in this policy to third parties as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change of control, transfer of assets or reorganisation of our business. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful, including but not limited to enforcing the <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Use</a>. Enideo will not use your personal data for marketing.
</p>
<p>
We will not sell, trade or rent Personally Identifiable Information to third parties. However, we reserve the right to share aggregated site statistics with third parties, such as advertisers on this Website. We may engage third parties to process data on our behalf but will require these third parties to comply strictly with this Privacy Policy and Enideo will require that they do not use your personal information for their own business purposes.
</p>

<h2>5. Security of Information</h2>
<p>
Once transmitted to us, we will keep your Personally Identifiable Information secure consistent with current industry standards. However, data transmission over the Internet is not completely secure and any transmission is at your own risk.
</p>
<p>
Some Content is limited-access, where access is gained through an obscured URL system. This obscured URL makes it difficult if not impossible for a third party to guess this URL address. We also monitor and try to block automated requests to such pages, to prevent any unauthorized access. However, because these web pages are not password-protected, a possibility exists that an unauthorized third party could discover them.
</p>
<p>
You should send or share these links only to people authorized to view such Content. If you are using a shared computer, we recommend that you delete your web browsing history. For the protection of your privacy, we do not put Personally Identifiable Information on any such Content.
</p>
<p>
Please be aware that you should exercise caution before deciding to disclose voluntarily your own personal data in User Content that can be viewed by the public.
</p>

<h2>6. Third Party Policies</h2>
<p>
Please note that this Website contains links to other websites. You should carefully review the privacy policies of those sites; they may differ from this Privacy Policy. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.
