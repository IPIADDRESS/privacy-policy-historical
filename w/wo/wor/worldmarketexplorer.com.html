<h1>WORLD MARKET PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<i>Effective date: November 9, 2009</i>
<p>We value your privacy. This notice describes our privacy policy and practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;We want you to know how we collect, use, and protect information about our customers. This privacy policy will tell you: </p>
<ul>
<li>What information we collect.</li>
<li>What we do with the information we collect.</li>

World Market is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other sites. You should consult the individual privacy policies of those websites to determine their privacy practices before disclosing any personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
<h3>Information You Provide</h3>

<p>We receive and may store any information you provide to us through our website. For example, we collect information that you provide when you place an order, register with us, send us an email, call us, sign up for our email offers or Rewards Program or enter a sweepstakes.

<p>It may also include any other personal or preference information you provide to us, including a record of your online product purchases. It may also include information you submit about other people, for example, the name and address of a gift recipient. </p>

<p>If you join our Rewards Program we will also store information about your purchases in order to calculate when you are eligible to receive a reward. </p>

<h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
<p>Our web servers automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us through our website.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when you visit the site, our system automatically recognizes your domain name and IP address(es), date and time of visits, the type of browser you use, the website from which your visit originated, page visits, time spent on web pages, and other similar traffic data.&nbsp;&nbsp;No personal information about you is revealed in this process.&nbsp;&nbsp;This information may be used by us to operate the website and to provide general statistics regarding the use of the website.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Our website uses "cookies" to customize your shopping experience or to keep track of your shopping cart. "Cookies" are pieces of information that are sent to your browser and stored in your computer's hard drive. Cookies enable us to more easily communicate and interact with you. You may disallow cookies through your web browser and still browse and shop on our website. </p>
<h3>Information from Other Sources</h3>

<p>We may obtain information about you from outside sources and combine it with your account information.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we may use commercially available demographics and other marketing information from third parties to help us better serve you or inform you about products or services that we think will be of interest to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;We sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we may also purchase lists containing your personal information (e.g., postal address, phone number, email address) for advertising and marketing purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>USE OF INFORMATION</h2>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>We may use your personal information to process or follow up with transactions initiated on the website or through our customer service department to let you know about products and promotions that we think may be of interest to you or to notify you when you have earned a reward under our Reward Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;We may share information provided by you directly or through cookies with companies that provide support services to us such as a transaction processor, printer, mailing house, or web host or with companies that help us market our products and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose, or to share that information with anyone other than the company and its agents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Disclosure to Successors</h3>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to any actual or potential successor-in-interest of ours, such as a company that is seeking to acquire us, the website, or the business and activities carried on via the website.</p>

<h3>Aggregate Information</h3>

<p>We may use anonymous IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our site, or to display the content according to your preferences.&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic and transaction information may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>

<h2>DISCLOSURES ORDERED BY LAW</h2>

<p>We may disclose information you provide to our website when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law; when it is necessary to identify, contact, bring, or defend legal action against persons or entities that we believe may be causing harm to you, our company, or third parties; and when necessary, to protect or defend our rights or property.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Correcting or Updating Information</h3>
<p>If you have registered with us, you may review for accuracy and update your account information online by logging in to "My Account" using your user name and password and editing your information accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of time we keep your information will vary depending on the nature of your transactions on the website and personal information involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have retention standards that meet customer service, legal and regulatory needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, we may keep your information beyond the end of your relationship with us.&nbsp;&nbsp;When your information is no longer required, we will dispose of it with appropriate care and diligence.</p>

<h2>SECURITY</h2>
<p>We have appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural security safeguards to protect and secure the information we collect.

<h2>UPDATES TO THIS POLICY</h2>
<p>Updates and changes to this privacy policy will be posted on our website and will be effective from the date they are posted, unless otherwise noted.&nbsp;&nbsp;New policies will apply to all current and past users of the website and supersede any inconsistent policies previously in effect.</p>
