For example, if you sign up for our email newsletter, we will send the newsletter to the email address you provided. If you so choose, we will also use Personally Identifiable Information to send you information about products and services that may be of interest to you. Once your purchase our package, you will be registered in our newsletter database by default so you may get promotional offerings and information everytime. Later on in this Privacy Statement, we provide you with more information on what choices you have. We use Anonymous Information to determine how people use the NepalChannelsproduct.
