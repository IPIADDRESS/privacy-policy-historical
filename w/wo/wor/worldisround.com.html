<h2>Worldisround Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><b>We guarantee that we will not violate your privacy.</b>
</p><dl class="helplist">
<dt>Overview</dt><dd>
This policy covers how Traveltell LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Corporation
("Worldisround") collects, manages and protects your personal information.
<p>
'Personal information' is information about you that is
personally identifiable like your name, address, e-mail address,
and phone number that is not otherwise publicly available.
</p><p>This policy does not apply to content that is posted to Worldisround
by users or anonymous visitors, including articles, photos and comments.
(Such content is not considered 'personal information'.)
</p></dd><dt>How We Collect Personal Information</dt><dd>
We do not collect personal information about you unless you
provide it to us. Most personal information is optional and
when personal information is required you can modify it or
make it private at any time.
</dd><dt>Information Required for Registration</dt><dd>
To create a new account on Worldisround, you must supply a user name,
login name, password, and e-mail address. Your login name and user name
can be anything and are always public. Your user name doesn't have to
be your real name â€” you could use your first name, your initials,
or any nickname or pseudonym you want.
<p>Your password is private, of course. The way our technology is set up
even we can't tell you what your password is but we can help you
change it if you forget it.
</p><p>As with most content web sites, passwords are <i>not</i>
(currently) encrypted
when you log into Worldisround so don't use the same password you
use to log into your computer or into a credit card website to log
into Worldisround.
</p><p>Your 'Country' selection, which is optional, will probably be
made public in the future, but it is not at this time.
</p></dd><dt>Why We Need Your E-mail Address</dt><dd>
You must provide a valid e-mail address when you create a Worldisround
account. If your e-mail address is invalid or if we are unable to
reach you (which is also possible if you or your e-mail provider marks our
e-mails as spam) we may close your account without warning -- because we
have no way to contact you!
<p>Your e-mail address can be hidden or public. If it is public,
it will appear on your user homepage and in e-mails sent from
Worldisround to friends &amp; family. If the e-mail is hidden, it
does not appear on your homepage and e-mails are sent anonymously.
</p><p>We encourage users to make their e-mail addresses public on Worldisround.
We often get people asking to use photos -- sometimes they are even willing
to pay for the rights -- but since the authors have hidden their e-mail
address they cannot be contacted. (You retain ownership of your own photos,
by the way, and only you can give someone else permission to use them.)
And when your e-mail address is public, we do our best to keep third party
'harvesters' from getting it by using a JavaScript trick.
</p><p>You may opt in or out of receiving Worldisround announcements (which are
currently rare). You may opt in or out of receiving Worldisround
notices when one of your articles receives a comment. You can not opt out
of receiving account notifications or queries from administrators, which
are necessary to maintain your account and deal with special situations.
In some cases ignoring Worldisround notifications can result in account
cancellation.
</p></dd><dt>Information Required for Premium Upgrades</dt><dd>
To make a purchase on Worldisround (e.g. upgrading to a Premium account,
purchasing more storage, etc.) with a credit card you must
supply all of the credit card information that our processor in turn
requires, including the card card number, expiration date, billing address,
phone number, etc. You choose whether Worldisround may store this
information for simplifying future purchases.
<p>We recognize that this is very
sensitive information and we have taken extra precautions to keeping
it secure. Whenever credit card information is collected, viewed, or
used on Worldisround the information is encrypted with SSL between
the web site and your Web browser.
</p></dd><dt>You Control Your Information</dt><dd>
You can change your user name, e-mail address, password, e-mail
options, and privacy settings at any time.
</dd><dt>We Will Not Sell Your Information</dt><dd>
We will not sell or rent any personal information about you to a
third party. Aggregate information, such as average age groups or
the percentage of hits coming from university accounts, may be
revealed to third parties but we will never reveal any other
information linked directly to your identity (that is "personally
identifiable").
<a name="coppa"></a>
</dd><dt>Protecting Children's Privacy</dt><dd>
Worldisround complies with the
<a href="http://www.coppa.org/">Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act</a> (COPPA). The Worldisround web site
is not directed at children under 13 years of age but we will allow
children to register with Worldisround with their parents' explicit
permission and with the understanding that they will use the site only
under adult supervision.
<p>For a child to register with Worldisround, a parent or legal guardian
of the child must:
</p><ul>
<li>Submit a valid credit card number to verify identity. (This information
will not be stored by Worldisround.)
</li><li>Read and agree to this Privacy Policy and the Worldisround Terms of Use.
</li><li>Complete the registration form for the child.
</li><li>Confirm via e-mail that the parent or legal guardian consents
to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.
</li></ul>
<p>If parental consent is provided, personal information that is collected
from the child will be treated the same as information collected from any
other Worldisround user. Parents and legal guardians may
request us to review, modify or delete
personally identifiable information about their child at any time.
</p><p>We will not knowingly collect personal information of children
under 13 years of age without parental consent and if we learn that
such information has been inadvertently collected we will promptly delete it.
</p></dd><dt>Changes to This Policy</dt><dd>
Worldisround may revise, modify or update this policy at any time.
We will notify Worldisround users of any significant revisions by
sending out an announcement e-mail (if e-mail is being accepted) and/or
placing a prominent notice on the web site.
</dd><dt>Cookies</dt><dd>
We use 'cookies' on certain pages of our site. Cookies are bits of
data saved by and used specifically for a Web site. Our site only uses
cookies that it originated, usually to keep track of a 'user session' that
makes logging into the site and writing articles possible.
</dd><dt>Web Site Activity</dt><dd>
We may track information about your Web site activity including
what URL you came from (identifying search engines, partner/linking
sites, etc.), what browser you are using, and how you navigate the site.
This information can help us determine which parts of the site are
popular or where navigation may be confusing, and help us improve the
site by looking at individual cases.
<p>We may internally use any information gathered about you to improve
our marketing focus, to guide the site features &amp; design, to analyze site
usage, and to improve site content.
</p><p>We may use your e-mail address to contact you for administrative purposes or to inform you of new site features.
</p></dd><dt>Exception</dt><dd>
One exception to this policy is that we will release specific information
about you or your account to comply with any reasonable, valid legal
process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order.
</dd><dt>Ask us Questions</dt><dd>
In writing this policy we are
trying to be honest, straightforward, complete, and legal all at the same
time. If any of these items seems vague or worrisome, please e-mail
us at <script type="text/javascript"><!--
