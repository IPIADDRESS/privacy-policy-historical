    Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement
  </h4> <p>
    Company will cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to
    enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose Personal Information and any other content
    and information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in
    our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate in order to respond to legal
    requests (including court orders and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property or rights of
    Company or of any third party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally
    actionable activity, or to comply with the law.
  </p> <h4>
    Be Careful When You Share Information with Others
  </h4> <p>
    Please be aware that whenever you share information on a publicly available page or any other
    public forum on the Site or Services, others may access that information. In addition, please
    remember that when you share information in any other communications with third parties, that
    information may be passed along or made public by others. This means that anyone with access
    to such information can potentially use it for any purpose, including sending unsolicited
    communications.
  </p> <h4>
    Exclusions
  </h4> <p>
    This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Company
    through the Site or Services or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to,
    information posted to any public areas of the Site, such as bulletin boards, any ideas for new
    products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions
    (collectively, âUnsolicited Informationâ). All Unsolicited Information shall be
    deemed to be non-confidential and Company shall be free, and you hereby grant Company the
    right, to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others
    without limitation or attribution.
  </p> <h4>
    Security
  </h4> <p>
    We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and
    security of Personal Information and other information transmitted to us. However, no data
    transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a
    result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through the Site or Services,
    we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the
    Site or Services, and you do so at your own risk.
  </p> <h4>
    Links
  </h4> <p>
    Our Site and Services may contain links or integrate with other websites and online services,
    or allow others to send you such links. Company is not responsible or liable for any damage or
    loss related to your use of any third-party website or online service. You should always read
    the terms and conditions and privacy policy of a third-party website or online service before
    using it, whether directly or in connection with your use of the Site or Services.
  </p> <h4>
    Children's Privacy
  </h4> <p>
    We offer to our users a range of Services, some of which are primarily targeted at children,
    and others that are intended for users of all ages and their families. We are required under
    the Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), with limited exceptions, to obtain
    verifiable parental consent in order to collect, use, or disclose Personal Information from
    children.
  </p> <p>
    Many of our Services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any
    Personal Information from children. If our Services request age information from your child
    and your child indicates that he/she is under 13 years old, the Service will block your child
    from providing personal information. <strong>Please note, that if your child indicates that
    he/she is under the age of 13, your child WILL NOT be blocked from using our
    Services.</strong></p> <p>
    For our Services that are primarily directed at children under the age of 13, we do not
    collect Personal Information, except in those instances under COPPA where Personal Information
    may be collected without verifiable parental consent. For example, if your child provides us
    feedback or contacts us (for support, for example), we will collect the data included in the
    communication. We will use this personal information to assist your child with his/her query
    or support request and then delete such information once we have fulfilled the childâs query
    or support request. We do not share your childâs personal information with third parties,
    other than as described in this Privacy Policy.
  </p> <p>
    We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we
    become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a child under the
    age of 13, we will delete such information from our records. If you believe that we might have
    any Personal Data from a child under 13, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:support@with.in" class="email">support@with.in</a>.
  </p> <h4>
    Processing in the United States
  </h4> <p>
    Please be aware that your Personal Information and communications may be transferred to and
    maintained on servers or databases located outside your state, province, or country. By using
    our Site or Services, you agree that the applicable laws in the United States will govern the
    collection, use, transfer, and disclosure of your Personal Information and communications. The
    laws in the United States may not be as protective of your privacy as those in your location.
    By providing your data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all
    steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with
    this Privacy Policy.
  </p> <h4>
    Your Rights
  </h4> <p>
    Opt-out. You may contact us any time to opt-out of: (a) direct marketing communications; (b)
    automated decision-making and/or profiling; (c) our collection of sensitive personal data; (d)
    any new processing of your Personal Information that we may carry out beyond the original
    purpose; or (e) the transfer of your Personal Information to places other than the United
    States. Please note that your use of some of the Services may be ineffective upon opt-out.
  </p> <p>
    Access. You may access the data we hold about you at any time by contacting us directly.
  </p> <p>
    Amend. You can also contact us to update or correct any inaccuracies in your Personal
    Information.
  </p> <p>
    Move. Your data is portable, so you have the flexibility to move your Personal Information and
    data to other service providers as you wish.
  </p> <p>
    Ease and forget. In certain situations, for example, when the Personal Information and data we
    hold about you is no longer relevant or is incorrect, you can request that we erase your data.
  </p> <p>
    Retention. We will only retain your Personal Information as required for you to use the
    Services and/or to provide you with the Services, unless a longer retention period is required
    or permitted by law (for example, for regulatory purposes).
  </p> <p>
    You may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@with.in" class="email">support@with.in</a> or
    Within Unlimited, Inc., Privacy Policy Inquiry, 3760 Motor Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90034 any time
    for any other questions you may have about your Personal Information, our use of such Personal
    Information, or to exercise one of your rights described above.
  </p> <h4>

    From time to time, we may change this Privacy Policy. If we change this Privacy Policy, we
    will give you notice by posting the revised Privacy Policy on the Site and within our
