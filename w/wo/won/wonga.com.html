    <h1 class="header"><a name="share" id="share"></a>We share your information</h1>
    <p>We have relationships with trusted third parties that perform services on our behalf. This includes credit bureaus, customer service agents, and collection agencies. We share information with these service providers in order to complete the transactions that you request. All service providers are bound by contract to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information.<br>
We may share your information with law enforcement or other government agencies as required by law.</p>
    <h1 class="header"><a name="protect" id="protect"></a>We protect your information</h1>
    <p>Wonga does not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.<br>
      The information we collect from you when you register with Wonga is kept securely in our database. We retain this information to satisfy legal requirements such as recordkeeping and tax and credit reporting requirements, as well as for purposes of fraud prevention, auditability and data integrity.<br>
      <br>
    At Wonga, we are committed to maintaining the security and confidentiality of your personal and financial information. We maintain electronic, and procedural safeguards that meet or exceed industry standards for financial institutions.<br>
    <br>
We protect your sensitive account information by storing it in encrypted form on computers not connected to the Internet. We control access to this information via secure web pages, and limit access to only those employees or third parties on a need to know basis. We do not allow visibility to bank account information, or credit card information via the web site.<br>
<br>
We employ firewalls and other security technologies to protect our servers from external attack. We enable our servers with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to establish a secure connection between your computer and our servers, creating a private "conversation" that cannot be viewed or accessed by other parties. We test our systems regularly to insure that our security mechanisms are up to date.</p>
    <h1 class="header">Other important information</h1>
    <h2><a name="MarketingPreferences" id="MarketingPreferences"></a>Marketing preferences</h2>
    <p>Wonga does not sell or rent your information to third parties or marketing firms. We do send communications to you periodically to notify you of status or events. Some of these communications are required as part of transactions you are contemplating through our web site.</p>
    <h2><a name="cookies" id="cookies"></a>Our use of cookies</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small text files created by a web site that store information on your computer, such as your preferences when visiting that site. Wonga uses cookies when you sign in, to keep track of your personal session, including some account identifiers so that we can ensure that you are the only person making changes to your account. We also use cookies to track your activity on our site as a unique person. All of this information is stored in an encrypted fashion for security reasons, and no personal information about you is stored.</p>
    <p>We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. Session ID cookies expire when you close you browser. We use a persistent cookie that remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time, so that we can recognize you when you return to our web site. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file; however, because we use cookies for our sign-in functionality, if you choose to disable cookies you will not be able to log on to the Wonga web site.</p>
    <h2><a name="beacons" id="beacons"></a>Our use of web beacons</h2>
    <p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better understand user interaction with our web site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p>
    <h2><a name="thirdpartylinks" id="thirdpartylinks"></a>Third party links</h2>
    <p>Wonga may post links to third party web sites that are not subject to this privacy policy.. If you visit these web sites, we encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing them with any personal information.</p>
    <h2><a name="tips" id="tips"></a>Helpful tips on protecting your information</h2>
    <p>Password reminder: It is a good practice to select a password for your account that is unique, a combination of letters, numbers and symbols, and isn't predictable or easy to guess. For instance, "Buster" may be your pet's name and easy to remember, but "!Buster1" would be difficult for someone to guess. Another good practice is to change your password periodically (every 90 days).</p>
    <h2><a name="changestothispolicy" id="changestothispolicy"></a>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>To accommodate changes to our web site, changing technology, and possible legal requirements, Wonga may change this privacy policy at any time. We will promptly post any policy changes to this page and notify our members directly with notice of any material changes.</p>
    <p>For additional information, or if you have any questions regarding this policy or the privacy practices at Wonga, please submit your questions or comments directly to <a href="mailto:privacy@wonga.com">privacy@wonga.com</a> via email. Any personal information you submit will be used solely to respond to your requests.<br>

    <ol>
        <li>if you ask us to or give us your permission to do so;</li>
        <li>to a credit reference agency to check your identity and to prevent fraud, (they will also keep a record of your request and use it whenever anyone applies to be authenticated in your name);  </li>
        <li>if you are a borrower, to tell credit reference agencies that you have an account and how you run that account; </li>

</li>

<li>We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies. </li>
<li>Any credit reference agency we search will keep a record of any search, and other lenders may use it to assess applications they receive from you in the future.</li>
<li>As a general rule, we will give you at least 28 days notice if we decide to file a default on your credit reference file. However, we may not always give you notice beforehand, for example, if we plan to take court action.</li>
<li>We may transfer your Personal Information abroad to countries whose data protection laws are less strict than in the UK. If so, we will ensure the information is held securely to standards as least as good as those in the UK and only used for the purposes set out in this clause.  </li>
<li>Under the Data Protection Act 1998, you have a right to access certain personal records we, credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies hold about you. This is called a âsubject access requestâ, which you can make by writing to jonny.spencer@wonga.com. A fee may be payable, but we will not charge you until we have told you how much the fee is and what it is for, and you have told us you still want to proceed.</li>
