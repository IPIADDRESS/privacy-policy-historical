    5. What are the purposes for which your personal data is used?
  </h2>
  <div class="accordion-cont">
    <p class="mo-p">
      We mainly use your personal data to provide you with a loan and manage your account. However, we also process your personal data for many other different purposes. Under data protection laws, we need a specific reason every time we use your personal data and this is otherwise known as a legal ground. We rely on one or more of the legal grounds set out below when processing your personal data:
    </p>
    <ul class="mo-ul">
      <li>
        The processing is necessary for the provision and administration of your consumer credit agreement and for us to provide lending services, including assessing your application, managing your loan, collecting payments, recovering debts, making any amendments to your loan and providing other related services to you, such as resolving complaints
      </li>
      <li>
        Where we have a legal or regulatory obligation to use your personal data, for example to comply with any laws or regulations that apply to us, or if the Financial Conduct Authority (<span class="mo-text-strong">FCA</span>), Information Commissioner's Office (<span class="mo-text-strong">ICO</span>), Competition and Markets Authority (<span class="mo-text-strong">CMA</span>) or Financial Ombudsman Service (<span class="mo-text-strong">FOS</span>) requires us to do something, such as comply with any redress programme, create or maintain certain records of any dealings with you, or disclose to them any records including your personal data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Where we need to use your personal data for reasons of public interest, such as investigating fraudulent claims, carrying out fraud, credit and anti-money laundering checks and preventing other crimes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Where we have an appropriate business need, otherwise referred to in data protection laws as 'legitimate interests', which could include running our company and internal operations, complying with our legal and regulatory obligations, evaluating your ability to pay back a loan, assessing whether another lender could more suitably lend to you, providing sustainable lending services, providing high quality and appropriate lending services, protecting our business by ensuring we have the correct information about you and preventing crimes (including fraud), administering loan repayments, recovering outstanding debts, maintaining our business records, developing, improving and marketing our products and services, improving the quality and security of our services, understanding and improving our business and services, ensuring our systems work as efficiently as possible, protecting the security of our systems, resolving complaints, maintaining customer satisfaction, complying with any redress programme and receiving professional advice. We only rely on this legal ground if the business need does not interfere with your rights and freedoms.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mo-p">
      When the information we process is classed as a special category of personal data (such as details about your health) or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences, we must have an additional legal ground for such processing and, in these circumstances, we will generally rely on the following legal grounds:
    </p>
    <ul class="mo-ul">
      <li>
        You have provided your explicit consent.
      </li>
      <li>
        We need to process your special category or criminal convictions and offences personal data to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights such as when we are faced with any legal claims or where we want to pursue any legal claims ourselves.
      </li>
      <li>
        We need to process your special category or criminal convictions and offences personal data for reasons of substantial public interest such as preventing or detecting unlawful acts such as fraud.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mo-p">
      We have listed below the different ways in which we use your personal data and you will find details of the legal grounds we could rely on for each use. We only need to rely on one legal ground for each use of your personal data.

    <p class="mo-p">
      We will use this information to:
    </p>
    <ul class="mo-ul">
      <li>
        assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product
      </li>
      <li>
        verify the accuracy of the data you have provided to us
      </li>
      <li>
        prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering
      </li>
      <li>
        manage your account and your loans
      </li>
      <li>
        trace and recover debts
      </li>
      <li>
        ensure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mo-p">
      We will continue to exchange information about you with CRAs while you have a relationship with us. We will also inform the CRAs about your settled accounts. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs.
    </p>
    <p class="mo-p">
      If you fall behind with your payments and a full payment or satisfactory proposal is not received within 28 days of a formal demand being issued, a default notice may be recorded with the CRAs. Any records shared with CRAs will remain on file for 6 years after your account is closed, whether any outstanding sums have been settled by you or following a default.
    </p>
    <p class="mo-p">
      When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders. Large numbers of applications within a short time period may affect your ability to obtain credit, this is applicable whether you have been accepted or declined.
    </p>
    <p class="mo-p">
      If you have a spouse or financial associate, CRAs link your records together and these links will remain on your files until you or your partner successfully file for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.
    </p>
    <p class="mo-p">
      If you give us false or inaccurate information and we have reasonable grounds to suspect fraud or we identify fraud we may record this and may also pass this information to fraud prevention agencies (<span class="mo-text-strong">FPAs</span>) and other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention, including law enforcement agencies who may access this information. If we determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide you with a loan. A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the FPAs and may result in others refusing to provide services to you. The FPAs can hold your personal data for up to 6 years.

      Our main database is kept in the UK. However, we also have operations in the Republic of South Africa and your personal data will also be accessed from that location. In addition, we (or third parties acting on our behalf) may process your personal data in countries outside the European Economic Area (<span class="mo-text-strong">EEA</span>). In both cases when we transfer your personal data outside of the EEA we take the required steps to ensure that your personal data is protected by placing the party we are transferring information to under contractual obligations to protect it to adequate standards and, where relevant, by ensuring that such party is a member of a scheme that has been approved by the European authorities as providing a suitable level of protection, for example the Privacy Shield scheme agreed between the European and US authorities.

        The right to request a manual review of an automated decision (including profiling)
      </h3>
      <p class="mo-p">
        Credit-related decisions about whether and how much to lend to you are made automatically. We process the personal data you have provided to us, together with any of your personal data included in our records such as previous loan payment history and that which we have obtained from the credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies. We use this information to evaluate automatically your ability to pay back a loan and provide you with a credit score, which enables us to make fair and responsible lending decisions. The consequence of this automated processing is that we may decide not to lend to you or we may decide to offer to lend to you an amount less than you applied for. The credit scoring methods we use to make these credit-related decisions are regularly tested to ensure they remain fair, effective and unbiased.
      </p>
      <p class="mo-p">
        We also decide automatically whether you pose a fraud or money laundering risk. We process your information to see if your behaviour is either consistent with that of known fraudsters or money launderers or inconsistent with your previous submissions, or you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity. The consequence of this automated processing is that we may decide not to lend to you and we may pass this information to fraud prevention agencies and other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention.
      </p>
      <p class="mo-p">
        You may contact us to request that any decision to decline your loan application is reconsidered manually by our employees using the contact details set out in section 15 of this Privacy Policy.
