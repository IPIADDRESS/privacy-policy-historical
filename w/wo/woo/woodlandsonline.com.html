<h3>Woodlands Online Privacy Policy</h3>

You have a right to expect a Web site to disclose its privacy policies - how your personal information is collected, used, and shared. You also have a responsibility to choose which sites you feel comfortable disclosing such information to. <br><br><b>Item A: Access to Registration Information</b><br>Woodlands Online will under no circumstances give access to your registration information to any third party for any purpose, either commercial or otherwise. Your information is maintained on a secure webserver in what we believe to be a well protected environment. Woodlands Online nor any Website operator, however, can guarantee that your information will remain secure from unauthorized access. <br><br><b>Item B: Cookies</b><br>In order to become a registered member of Woodlands Online, you must have 'Cookies' enabled on your machine. Our website relies on this technology to allow you to re-access your registered user profile and personalized page during a web session. In this way, once you initially log in during a web session, you will not be asked for your log-in ID and password again unless you log out. This mechanism is employed solely for your convenience and for no other purpose.<br><br><b>Item C: Public vs Confidential Information</b><br>You acknowledge that all of your submissions and postings to the public portion of the Website are public and not private information. Always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information about yourself or your household. Woodlands Online specifically disclaims any liability with regard to any actions resulting from your submissions and postings to the public portion of the  Website. Generally, any communication which you post to the Website is considered to be non-confidential. If a particular webpage or form permits the submission of information that will be treated by Woodlands Online as confidential, that fact will be stated on those pages.<br><br><b>Item D: Use of Public Information</b><br>By posting communications on or through the Website, you automatically grant Woodlands Online a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, perform, and display the information alone or as part of other works in any form, media, or technology whether now known or hereafter developed. The foregoing grants shall include the right to exploit any proprietary rights in such communication, including but not limited to rights under copyright, trademark, service mark or patent laws under any relevant jurisdiction. <p></p></td>
