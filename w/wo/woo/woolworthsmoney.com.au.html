<p><b>Woolworths Money Products</b>&nbsp;means products and services supplied under or by reference to the Woolworths Money trade mark.</p>

<p><b>WM personal information</b>&nbsp;means personal information collected from or about you related to Woolworths Money Products, for example as a result of your application for a Woolworths Money Product .</p>

<p><b>Woolworths</b>&nbsp;means Woolworths Limited ABN 88 000 014 675 and its related bodies corporate.</p>

<p>This statement concerns only WM personal information. Application forms for Woolworths Money Products contain terms and conditions regarding WM personal information. Because those terms and conditions provide for certain consents, if you agree to them they will impact on how Woolworths Money Providers use and disclose your personal information.

For example, you may be a client of Macquarie's financial planning services, a Woolworth's lay-by customer or you may have a bank account with ANZ, and for those relationships, Macquarie, Woolworths or ANZ collects personal information from you. This statement does not relate to that other information. For privacy information about that other personal information, see the relevant provider's privacy information at its website (for example <a href="http://www.woolworthslimited.com.au">www.woolworthslimited.com.au; </a><a href="http://www.macquarie.com.au">www.macquarie.com.au;</a> <a href="http://www.aia.com.au">www.aia.com.au;</a> <a href="http://www.anz.com.au">www.anz.com.au</a>) or by contacting the provider directly.</p>


<p>Australian privacy law requires Woolworths Money Providers to be open about their general practices relating to the management of personal information. They must let people know, generally, what sort of information they hold, for what purposes and how they collect, hold, use and disclose that information. Woolworths Money Providers' privacy policies are at the websites referred to above (for example <a href="http://www.woolworthslimited.com.au">www.woolworthslimited.com.au; </a><a href="http://www.macquarie.com.au">www.macquarie.com.au;</a> <a href="http://www.aia.com.au">www.aia.com.au;</a> <a href="http://www.anz.com.au">www.anz.com.au</a>) or by contacting the provider directly.</p>
