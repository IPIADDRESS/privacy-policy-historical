<li>Debt collection agencies;</li>
<li>Any insurer, insurance broker or agent from whom or through whom any insurance policy is taken out, or to be taken out, in connection with any Woolworths Money Product;</li>
<li>Where they decide to sell or merge any aspect of their business, any person considering purchasing or who purchases, funds or manages that business or an interest in your Woolworths Money Products and their advisers;</li>
<li>Regulators and law enforcement agencies such as under court orders, taxation, social security or anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws or statutory notices and others in respect of whom you have given your consent.</li>

<h3>Is there any law that requires your particular WM personal information to be collected?</h3>

<p>You may decide not to provide a Woolworths Money Provider with any WM personal information. If you decide to apply for a Woolworths Money Product, some of the personal information for which you will be asked is permitted or required by law in order for the Woolworths Money Provider to process the application. Examples of relevant laws are financial transaction reporting, anti-money laundering, taxation, finance, credit and insurance laws. If you would like more information about this aspect, you may direct your query to the Privacy Officer whose details are given below.</p>

<h3>What are the main consequences (if any) if all or part of your WM personal information is not provided?</h3>

<p>You are not required to provide personal information in relation to all Woolworths Money products. For example, you can purchase the Woolworths Money Prepaid MasterCard® without making an application.</p>

<p>However, if an application is required to obtain a particular Woolworths Money Product, the main consequence of not providing your WM personal information is that your application will not be accepted.</p>
