				<p>At Woopra, we offer real-time customer analytics for our customers, who incorporate certain code such as JavaScript into their sites or use other identifiers so that when they use our customer relationship tools they can better understand their consumers’ activities. It also allows those website managers to identify their visitors within their system. Whenever a visitor to one of our customer’s sites submits their email address or information, that company can store this information so that the user will be identified during future visits. The JavaScript and other tools we make available to our customers use  only first party cookies or identifiers – not third party cookies. All of the data collected by that company can then be analyzed using various reports by the customer. The Woopra customer may also use the data to trigger events like targeted emails or website content. </p>

<h2>Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</h2>
<p>We use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site or Services, and we provide you with the ability to track users of your websites for data analytics purposes. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are stored on your computer through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Session Cookies.</strong> Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent cookies.</strong> Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity. Persistent cookies are set to expire two years after your last tracked action on Woopra.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Third Party Cookies.</strong> We may also engage third parties to track and analyze advertising conversions and for re-targeting purposes (i.e., re-advertise to people who visit our website). Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information that they have collected. This Policy does not cover such third parties’ use of the data.</p>
<p> <strong>Disabling Cookies.</strong> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function. </p>
<p><strong> Analytics.</strong> We use automated applications, such as our own application (Woopra), to track our visitors and evaluate usage of our Site and, to the extent permitted, our Mobile Apps. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences. We may use and share your personal information with third parties as further described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<h2>Third-Party Ad Networks</h2>
<p>We may use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our Sites. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our service.</p>
<p>You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites:  </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a> (NAI)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> (DAA).</li>
</ul>
<p>Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI’s and DAA’s websites accessible by the above links.</p>
<h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
<p>Our Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites.
