      <h3 style="text-align: left;">Types of  information we collect and how we collect it.</h3>
      <p>The majority of the product and service information posted  on our sites is offered without us collecting any personally identifiable  information from you. You can surf the websites and view much of our content  anonymously. </p>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" name="anch1">Information You  Provide</a></h3>
      <p>There are a few activities on our sites where the  collection of personally identifiable information is necessary. Those  activities include things like entering a contest or sweepstakes, making a  purchase, requesting a catalog, newsletter or other information, registering at  our sites or the Open Roads Forum, filling out a survey or questionnaire or  contacting us. We do not market , seek or solicit information or knowingly  collect information from children. </p>
      <p>When personally identifiable information is collected, you  will know because you will have to provide such information to us. For most  activities, we collect only your name, e-mail address, street address, zip  code, birth date, and RV type. When you make a purchase, we also collect your  billing address, your phone number, and credit card information. </p>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" name="anch2">Information  Collected from You with Technology</a></h3>
      <p>Our sites collect some information about you using  technology, so it may not be readily apparent to you that it is being  collected. For instance, when you visit our site, we automatically collect  certain non-personally identifiable information from your browser, such as your  Internet service provider's address, the web page from which you came, and a  record of your activity on our site. This information is not personally  identifiable. Our sites use information collected through technology to: make  our sites more interesting and useful to you; help advertisers on our site  design advertisements our users might like; help us generally improve the  content and layout of our website; notify you about updates to our website; and  contact you for marketing purposes. </p>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" name="anch3">Description of Cookies, and How We Use Them </a></h3>
      <p>Cookies are pieces of  information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the  website. These pieces of information allow the websites to remember important  information that will make your use of those sites more useful. Our sites and  other websites use cookies for a variety of purposes. As a result of your  accessing our site, we may use third party cookies and other technologies and  may receive information about your browsing and buying activity on our website. </p>
      <p>We contract with one or more third party site analysis  service partners to provide us with a data collection and reporting service.  When you access our site, a third party site analysis service partner may use  cookies and other technologies on our behalf and may receive information about  your browsing and buying activity on our website. Such data collection may be  compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregated  data with our affiliates, agents and business partner. This aggregate information does not identify  you personally. We may also disclose  aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful  purposes.</p>
      <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a  cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this  through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings.  Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to  learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you  won't have access to many of our features that make your web experience more  efficient. </p>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" name="anch4">How We Use the  Personally Identifiable Information that We Collect </a></h3>
      <p>When you supply us with personally identifiable  information, the information you provide is added to our customer file. We use  personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways. We use the  information to complete transactions. For instance, we use your information to  process your order, or if you contact us for help we will use the information  to contact you. We use information collected to notify you if you've won a game  or contest. Information we collect is also used to send you: e-mail updates  related to clubs, products and services, discounts, upcoming events and  newsletters about our sites; RV or other e-mail promotions and special offers  from our third-party sponsors; periodic mailings or telephone contact related  to clubs, products and services, discounts, upcoming events, newsletters about  our sites; periodic mailings related to RV or other promotions and special  offers from our third-party sponsors. </p>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" name="anch5">Who We Share Your  Information With </a></h3>
      <p>To enhance your experience on our websites, from time to  time we may provide information to a select group of companies that offer  products and services that may be of interest to you. We also share information  for security reasons. </p>
      <p>Sometimes we use third party companies to help us provide  or deliver products or services. In those instances, we need to share your  information with them to deliver products, assist us in collecting and managing  customer information, fulfill promotions and/orders and/or communicate with  you.  Some of these companies are given  access to some or all of the information you provide us, and some may use  cookies or other technologies on our behalf. These companies are restricted  from using your information in any manner other than in helping us to deliver or  provide you our products and services. </p>
      <p>On occasion, we offer promotions – such as sweepstakes or  free subscriptions -- in conjunction with a sponsor. We may share your  information with the sponsors if they need it to send you a product, such as a  magazine subscription. We may share your information with those sponsors that  can send you other special promotions. In addition, we will occasionally send  e-mail promotions to our users on behalf of third-party sponsors regarding  lifestyle-related products or services. </p>
      <div style="margin-left:4em;">
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" name="anch6">Content Providers </a></h3>
        <p>On some of our sites, we provide  content that is created by a third-party website. In some instances the  third-party sites will collect information in order to facilitate the  transaction or to make the use of their content more productive and efficient.  In these circumstances the information collected is shared between our  third-party sponsors and us. </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" name="anch7">Third-Party Advertisers and Network Advertisers </a></h3>
        <p>Our privacy policy does not apply  when you click on an advertisement and leave our site. You must read the  privacy policy of that advertiser to see how your personal information will be  handled on it's site.<br>
          In addition, many advertisements  are managed and placed on our site by third-party companies. These companies  are called "network advertisers." Network advertisers collect  information when you click on or scan one of their banner advertisements. The  information is collected using technology, so you may not realize it is being  collected. The network advertisers collect this information so that they can  show you ads that are more relevant and interesting to you. </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" name="anch8">Sale of Businesses </a></h3>
        <p>We may sell certain of our  businesses or assets to other companies. When such transactions take place,  visitor information (including personally identifiable information) may  constitute a part of the transferred business assets. In the event that we, or  any of our affiliates, sell substantially all of our assets to another company,  visitor information (including personally identifiable information) likely will  be considered an asset that will be transferred to such company. </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" name="anch9">Organizations That Help Protect the Security and Safety of our Users  and our Sites </a></h3>
        <p>We will give out personal  information as required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or  subpoena; to enforce our Terms of Service, or site or game rules; or to protect  the safety and security of users and our sites. </p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" name="anch11">How You Can Access Your Account Information </a></h3>
        <p>In many cases, if you have  established an account with one of our business units, you can review your  communication preferences through the "My Account" section of our websites.  Communication preferences are permissions that you have granted us to communicate  with you on specific areas of interest. You may make modifications to your  communication preferences directly through this section of "My Account". </p>
        <p>If you don't have an account,  can't find your account or our site doesn't provide an account section, you can  simply contact us via email by clicking "Contact Us" on any of our  Web pages or send an email directly to info@affinitygroup.com. Please include  information in the email that will help us identify your account so we can  assist you with your inquiry or request.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" name="anch12">E-mail Communications</a></h3>
        <p>You can  use much of our site without giving us any personally identifiable information.  When you register with us or give us personally identifiable information, you  will have an opportunity at the time we collect your information to limit  e-mail communications from us and our third-party marketing partners. At  anytime you can request that we not send e-mails to you anymore either by  unsubscribing from the communication or by contacting us at  info@affinitygroup.com. </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" name="anch13">Direct Mail Communications</a></h3>
        <p>We  recognize that your privacy is very important to you and we are committed to  protecting it.&nbsp; When you subscribe to our publications, join our clubs or  otherwise do business with us, please tell us if you do not want to receive our  direct mail marketing offers for any or just certain products and/or  services.&nbsp; We will mark your account for a three-year period.

      <h3 style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" name="anch14">The Type of  Security We Provide </a></h3>
      <p>Security is of the utmost concern and importance to us for  all personally identifiable information associated with our users. We take  technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect  all visitors' information. When you provide credit card information, we use  secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect it. However, no internet or  e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. </p>
      <p>There are some things that you can do to help protect the  security of your information as well. For instance, never give out your  password, since this is what is used to access all of your account information.  Also remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when  you finish surfing the Web so that other people using the same computer won't  have access to your information. </p>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" name="anch15">Children</a></h3>
      <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable  information from children under the age of 13. If you are under thirteen,  please do not submit any personally identifiable information through our  website. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's  internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their  children to never provide personally identifiable information on our website  without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the  age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us through this  website, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information  from our databases.</p>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" name="anch16">Exclusions </a></h3>
      <p>This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited  information you provide us through any of our websites or through other means.  This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of  our website, such as bulletin boards (collectively, "Public Areas"),  any ideas for new products or modifications to existing services, and other  unsolicited submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited Information"),  including all User Content as that term is defined in our Terms of Use. All  such Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we  shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited  Information to others without limitation or attribution. Please also note that any personally  identifiable information or other information you provide to be displayed in  your publicly available online profile will be displayed for others to see and  thus will not be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We cannot and  will not be responsible for what third parties do with any personally  identifiable information or other information that you choose to make publicly  available. As such, we advise that you exercise great care in determining what  information you choose to make publicly available through our websites. </p>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" name="anch17">Policy Changes</a></h3>
      <p>Please note: Due to the rapidly changing nature of the  Internet, we may change this Privacy Policy from time to time based on your  comments and our need to accurately reflect our data collection and disclosure  practices. This Privacy Policy is effective as of December 10, 2008 and has not been revised in any  material respect since such effective date. All changes to this Privacy Policy  are effective immediately. In  the event of any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify users  of our site of the change by providing an "updated as of" date on the  "Privacy Policy" link on our website, which "updated as of"  date will remain in the "Privacy Policy" link for a period of at  least 30 days after the effectiveness of the changes.</p>
