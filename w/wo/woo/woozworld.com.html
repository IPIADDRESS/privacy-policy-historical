<p>The use of Woozworld means your acceptance of the following terms and conditions. </p>
<p>We are committed to protecting your online privacy when visiting Woozworld(hereinafter “Woozworld”). </p>
<p>We do not collect or keep any personal information online from you unless you volunteer it. We also do not collect and keep personal information online from children without consent of a parent or legal guardian, except in limited circumstances authorized by law and described in this policy. </p>
<p>Please review the information below to familiarize yourself with our policies on website privacy, so that you can take full advantage of all the fun activities available at our sites for you and your family. Please remember that this site and the servers that make this site available are located in Canada. By using this site you agree to the transfer, collection, processing and use of personal data by this site. </p>

<h2>A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS AND LEGAL GUARDIANS: </h2>
<p>Woozworld respects the U.S Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the guidelines of the Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureau, Inc. in each of its websites for children. You can help by spending time online with your children and monitoring your children’s online use. Please help us protect your child’s privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this website or any other without your permission. </p>
<p>If you are under 18, please be sure to read this policy with your parents or legal guardians and ask questions about things you do not understand. Children under 13 should get your parent’s or legal guardian’s permission before giving out your e-mail address or any personal information to Woozworld. </p>

<h2>1. Does Woozworld Collect Any Personal Information about Me If I’m Minor? </h2>
<p>Woozworld doesn’t require anyone to share any personal information about them in order to enjoy any of our websites. You can visit our sites without any need to register with us. However, most of our sites contain special sections and privileges for members that register. We do not collect any personal information from you or your children unless it is voluntarily provided, for instance when registering for contests, completing our online customer surveys or purchasing products. The personal information we ask for is usually pseudo and last name, mailing address, and an e-mail address. See below for how we use this information. </p>

<h2>2. What Ordering Information Does Woozworld Collect In Our Online Stores? </h2>
<p>We may offer opportunities to purchase products in our online stores. Customers must be over the age of 18 with a valid credit card. When a customer places an order or requests a catalogue online, we collect information associated with the transaction, which will include the customer’s name, mailing and emailing address, products ordered, and credit card information. We ask for this information so that we may fulfill the order or catalogue request. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect credit card data during transmission to our website, and adopt careful internal procedures to safeguard this information in our system. </p>
<p>When a customer places an order online, we will send a confirming e-mail message. We may also send an occasional e-mail featuring a special promotion or product that may be of interest to customers. Any customer who prefers not to receive an online order confirmation or promotional e-mail should indicate this preference on the online store order form. If you do receive an e-mail from us that you would rather not receive, simply follow the «unsubscribe» instructions included in the e-mail. </p>

<h2>3. Does Woozworld Collect Any Personal Information About Children? </h2>
<p>Woozworld is only collecting the following information to allow access to the game: </p>

<li>Your child’s user name. Your child is encouraged to use a «screen name» (not their real name) that only they know. </li>

<li>A password: we will ask your child to make up a special password so that only they can see their personal area on the site. </li>
<li>Your child’s age: we will ask your child age to propose him the most appropriate program. </li>
<li>Your email: we will ask your child for your e-mail so that we can notify you of your child’s registration and get your permission for special features of the program. </li>
<p>We do not collect other personal information online from children without consent of a parent or legal guardian. </p>
<p>We do not use your email for promotional communications and information, unless you agree. If you no longer wish your child to participate in an e-mail newsletter, simply click on the link that is provided for removal or contact us at privacypolicy@woozworld.com. </p>
<p>Occasionally, Woozworld has special site activities or promotions like sweepstakes or contests that are open to children. In these activities, we are not allowed to ask for more information from your child than what is necessary for your child to participate in the activity. If we need more than the aforementioned info for your child to participate in a particular online activity, we will ask your child for your e-mail or mailing address so that we can notify you of your child’s request and get your permission. When we ask for your permission, we will tell you what we will do with the information you or your child provides us, and we will tell you how you can review your child’s information and ask us to delete the information. </p>
<p>And last, when you, parents, want to be involved in our Mom’s Club you will complete the SurveyMonkey survey, in which you will have to provide your (1) first and last name; (2) country of residence; (3) age range; (4) profession; (5) the age and gender of each of their children; and (6) email address. </p>
<p>Upon proper identification, parents or legal guardians may review the personal information we have collected about their child, request deletion, change information that is inaccurate or out of date, or refuse to allow further collection or use of the information. <a href="/kcPromoPropelPlugin/pdf/privacy_request_form_en.pdf" target="_blank" class="special">Click here to print a copy</a> of our Personal Information Review Access Request, fill it out completely and mail it to: </p>

<h2>6. How Does Woozworld Use Cookies? </h2>
<p>A «cookie» is a small file that we save on your computer’s hard drive that contains non-personal information. Our cookies help to give you faster access to pages you have already visited; they allow you to personalize your pages and us to customize our offerings; and they help you to participate in some activities or events on the site. For instance, some of our sites have an historic functionality, and we need to use cookies to keep track of your progress and favorite games or videos. If you leave the site and then return, cookies will tell us what things you have already collected so that you do not have to start all over again. </p>
<p>We also use cookies to help us figure out how many people visit our sites, which of our Web pages they stop at and how long they stay there. This information helps us figure out which of our Web features are successes and what sites might need improvement. For administrative purposes, we collect IP addresses, which is the automatic number assigned to your computer when you surf the Web. Certain Internet Service Providers may assign the same IP address to many users. The IP address allows us to count the total number of «hits» on our sites. However, your IP address and cookie are not connected to any personally identifiable or online contact information like a name and address, so you and your family remain anonymous. We also use other technology, called clear GIFs, to provide us with other important anonymous information, such as when an e-mail has been opened. </p>

<p>Except for certain activities like contests or content accessibility, which we talked about above, Woozworld doesn’t use cookies for direct marketing or promotional purposes. Cookies are also not used to collect information specifically about you or your family for sharing with third parties. </p>
