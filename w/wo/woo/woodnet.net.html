</ol>
<h3 id="p1">1. How does August Home collect and use my e-mail address?</h3>
<p>
	E-mail addresses may be collected when you subscribe to one of our
	magazines. We will use your e-mail address to contact you when it is time
	to renew your subscription and to send you information on August Home
	products or services. We do not currently rent, sell or give email
	addresses to any third party; however, in the future, we may rent only
	those email addresses collected from magazine subscriptions to reputable
	third parties who wish to promote their products or services to you via
	e-mail.
</p>
<p>
	When ordering a gift subscription, you are given the option of providing
	the recipient’s e-mail address for August Home to notify him or her
	of their gift subscription. Unless the gift recipient chooses in the future
	to provide August Home with his or her e-mail address, recipients will be
	contacted via e-mail for gift notification purposes only and will not
	receive any further electronic correspondence from August Home or third
	parties. 
</p>
<p>
	We also collect your e-mail address in a variety of other circumstances
	including, but not limited to, when you sign up to receive e-mail tips,
	take part in a survey, participate in a forum, order a product or sign up
	to receive electronic information or other value added content available
	through purchase of a special interest book. We will contact you via
	e-mail, depending on the circumstances which you had provided your e-mail
	address. For example, we may contact you to send you e-mail tips, to notify
	you if you are a winner of an online contest, to confirm your identity as
	part of a forum, to e-mail you a lost password or user i.d., to answer a
	question you have about a product you ordered or to notify you if a product
	you ordered is out of stock.
</p>
<p>
	In order to keep you up-to-date on the services and products offered by
	August Home, we may occasionally contact you via e-mail to alert you of
	specific offers, products or services that we feel may be of interest to
	you. We will not, unless otherwise indicated in this privacy policy, rent,
	sell or give your e-mail address to any third party.
</p>
<h3 id="p2">2. How do I stop receiving e-mails from August Home?</h3>
<p>
	Anytime you receive an e-mail offering a product or service from August
	Home and you wish to stop receiving or “opt-out” of receiving
	any similar e-mails, you may either (1) click the “opt-out”
	link at the bottom of each e-mail or (2) contact August Home Customer
	Service as set forth below. Our business hours are Monday through Friday,
	8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Standard Time.
</p>
<address>Toll-Free E-mail Customer Service Line: 1-866-553-7514</address>
<address>August Home Publishing Company Customer Service</address>
<address>2200 Grand Avenue</address> <address>Des Moines, IA 50312</address>
<address>E-mail: <a href="mailto:orders@augusthome.com">orders@augusthome.com</a></address>
<p>
	You may call the Toll-Free E-mail Customer Service Line to discuss with a
	representative which types of e-mails you are currently receiving from
	August Home and specify which e-mail list(s) you would like to remain on
	and which you would like to be removed from.
</p>
<h3 id="p3">3. How does August Home collect and use telephone numbers and
street addresses?</h3>
<p>
	We collect telephone numbers and street addresses in certain circumstances
	including, but not limited to, when customers purchase a product for
	themselves or others from one of August Home’s e-commerce web sites
	or order a subscription for themselves or others to one of our magazines.
	We will use customers’ street addresses to fulfill orders or magazine
	subscriptions. We or one of our business partners working on our behalf may
	use customers’ street addresses and/or telephone numbers to contact
	them if there is a question about an order, if something is out of stock or
	to notify a customer when it is time to renew his or her subscription. In
	order to keep customers up-to-date on the services and products offered by
	August Home, we may occasionally use our customers’ street addresses
	and/or telephone numbers to alert them of specific August Home offers,
	products or services that we feel may be of interest to them. As a
	subscriber, our customers’ street addresses and/or telephone numbers
	may be rented to reputable third parties who wish to promote their product
	or service.
</p>
<h3 id="p4">4. How can I stop receiving telephone calls or mailings from August
Home or third parties?</h3>
<p>
	Please contact August Home Customer Service at the above telephone number
	or address if you do not want us to contact you regarding renewal of your
	magazine subscription or to receive August Home products or services. You
	may also contact August Home Customer Service if you do not want us to
	share your street address or telephone number with third parties.
</p>
<h3 id="p5">5. Can I be identified when I browse the web site?</h3>
<p>
	In general, you can browse this web site without telling us who you are or
	revealing any personal information about yourself. We are, however, able to
	determine your internet service provider’s (ISP) address and domain
	name (i.e. aol.com, hotmail.com, etc.). We use this information to help
	administer this web site, to measure the use of the web site and to improve
	the content of the web site. So we know where, in a general sense, our
	visitors are coming from, but we do not know who you are unless you tell us
	by filling out a form.
</p>
<p>
	Notwithstanding, August Home does research on our user’s
	demographics, interest and behavior based on the information provided to us
	during their use of the web site. This research is compiled and analyzed on
	an aggregated basis. Aggregated data does not include personally
	identifiable information. August Home may share this aggregated data with
	others.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, some of our web pages may contain cookies, which are tiny
	data files that are sent to your web browser and stored on your computer.
	This allows our web server to recognize you when you visit the web site in
	the future. Most web browsers can be configured to not accept cookies, or
	to notify you if a cookie is sent. If you choose not to accept cookies, you
	may not be able to take advantage of certain features of the web site that
	are available to other visitors.
</p>
<h3 id="p6">6. What is August Home’s policy on collecting information
from children?</h3>
<p>
	August Home’s web sites are not directed toward children and August
	Home does not intend to collect personally identifiable information from
	children under the age of 13 without the permission of the child’s
	parent or legal guardian. Children under the age of 13 should submit
	personally identifiable information to August Home only with the explicit
	permission of their parent or legal guardian. If your child has submitted
	personal information and you would like that information to be removed from
	our database, you may contact August Home as indicated above and we will
	use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. 
</p>
<h3 id="p7">7. What is August Home’s relationship to third parties or
other web sites?</h3>
<p>
	To make the web site more useful to our users, we may offer some features
	in conjunction with third party providers that specialize in operating such
	services. For example, if you choose to subscribe to one of our magazines
	through our web site, we may forward your information to a third party for
	services such as credit card processing and order fulfillment. When you
	purchase a product through our web site, the information you provide about
	yourself may also be forwarded to other sites which are managed or operated
	by third parties. Third party internet sites and services accessible
	through the August Home web site have separate privacy and data collection
	practices, independent from us. August Home has no responsibility or
	liability for these independent policies or actions.  
</p>
<p>
	In the event all or a portion of the assets owned or controlled by August
	Home or any parent subsidiary or affiliated entity are sold, assigned,
	transferred or acquired by another company, information from or about a web
	site users may be among the transferred assets.
</p>
<p>
	Please be careful and responsible online. If you post personal information
	online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited
	messages from other parties in return. While we strive to protect your
	information, August Home cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
	information through the transmission process and you do so at your own
	risk.
</p>
<p>
	If you have questions or comments about this privacy policy, you may
	contact us at the above address or send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:orders@augusthome.com">orders@augusthome.com</a>.
