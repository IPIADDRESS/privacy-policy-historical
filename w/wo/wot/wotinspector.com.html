            <p>Any service provided by wotinspector.com or it’s apps is subject to this privacy policy. This policy will detail how we store and use the information collected online about you on our websites, during your use of our products and/or services including apps on mobile platforms.</p>
            <p>The authors and owners of wotinspector.com are players of the games, we are a very small scale operation. We do value and respect the privacy rights of our users and recognize the importance of protecting the information collected. By using our products and services you consent to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information according to the terms of service and privacy policy as it is described in this document.</p>
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Here and below, the authors and owners of the website “wotinspector.com” may be collectively referred to herein as “wotinspector.com”, “we”, or “our”, “the app” or “the service”, when the context requires.  “Wotinspector.com” is a developer and publisher of resources, guides, apps and services for the web and mobile devices.</p>

            <p>If you access our products and services through a third party, you may be required to also read and accept that third party’s own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Some quick example of typical uses of personal information : when receiving a replay file from you, wotinspector.com may send you a confirmation email containing a link to that replay file. Also, because of the nature of replays and online gaming, players username will appear on these replays when they are published. This is related to wargaming’s own terms of service and is due to the nature of online gaming.</p>
            <h2>2. Reasons for collecting information</h2>
            <p>Wotinspector.com collects both personal and non-personal user information, mostly for technical reasons. Personal information is information that may identify you, or may be related to you or your account. Reasons collecting might be:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Registration for wotinspector.com and/or other service accounts;</li>
            <li>User support, contact, and/or technical service requests;</li>
            <li>User interaction and discussion;</li>
            <li>Beta test registration, participation or discussion;</li>
            <li>Contest registration and prize acceptance;</li>
            <li>Creation of a personal profile;</li>
            <li>Access to our products and/or services on social networks or other third party services; and</li>
            <li>Otherwise through normal use of our products, software, mobile or online service where personal information is required for use and/or participation.</li>
            <li>Creation of a personal profile;</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>3. Nature of the collected information</h2>
            <p>Information we may access and collect will vary depending upon the activity and may include your name, email address, in game name or account and platform, server, account or ID related to payments. You can choose not to provide (when such opportunity is provided) certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.</p>
            <p>Information that we don’t need and that we will not ask:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>land phone number</li>

            <li>mobile phone number</li>

            </ul>

This is for technical reasons, and might be needed to improve the app or service.</p>
            <p>Some information may be visible for technical reasons. For example, when you use the services we may be able to read the IP address, but we never personalize the IP addresses, e.g. we can't tell who was using the site or if that user is returning, and we do not collect, store or use it later.

For example, when you visit or request a web page from our server, we may record the IP address of the user’s machine, the time, date and URL of the request and information about the browser being used, and other information regarding the visit, such as the pages visited on the Service, the time spent on each page, any advertisements clicked and any search terms used (collectively “Log Data”).</p>
            <p>When you use any wotinspector.com services or product from a third party, you allow wotinspector.com to access certain information from your profile for that site. The information you allow wotinspector.com to access varies and it is affected by the privacy settings you established with the third party. You can control and find our more about these settings with that third party and not with us. By using a wotinspector.com service, you are authorizing wotinspector.com to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that you agreed the third party could provide to wotinspector.com through the third party Application Programming Interface. Your agreement takes place when you “accept” or “allow” or “install”(or similar terms) one of our applications on an third party.</p>
            <h2>4. Where we store and process your information</h2>

By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

When our third party agents or service providers collect and/or have access any information other than non-personal, anonymous and/or aggregated data, we then require that they use data consistently, abide to similar privacy policies, and comply with standard practice in place in the industry, particularly that they do not transmit it to anyone else or use it for another purpose or context than our service. These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose without your specific consent.</li>

Because of the nature of online gaming, your in game name and public messages (such as comments made in game) will be visible at times, for example when a player wants to playback a game in which you appear. He will see your ingame name and the chat messages that you sent. Therefore players may see your name, profile photo and descriptions of your game activity, your game profile. Other players having seen your in game name might also use it to contact you in game or to try to contact you using another service or social media. We cannot avoid this, as it is a consequence of online gaming itself.</li>
