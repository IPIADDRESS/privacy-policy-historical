For Wotif flights bookings we may also provide  to the airline other relevant information collected from you.  Our suppliers require this information for the  booking and may use it if they need to contact you about the booking.  Although we offer accommodation and flights  from reputable suppliers, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of  any supplier whose services you book on our website. <br>
            <br>
          </li>

            <br>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Legal  obligations</strong>:  We may be required by law to  disclose your PII or to service providers where we are investigating a serious  complaint or potential illegal acts. <br>

    <h4>Disclosure of your information overseas</h4>
        <p>Your PII may be transferred to, stored and processed overseas where those  third parties with whom we share it, as described in this policy, are  located.  Due to the nature of the accommodation  and travel services offered to you many of the accommodation and travel service  providers that we deal with are located overseas.

We do, however, engage a third party  technology platform provider based in the United States to facilitate marketing  campaigns controlled and managed by us. <br>
          <br>

By providing your PII to us  you consent to our disclosure of your PII to these parties.
