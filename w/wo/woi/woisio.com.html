<a name="2-use-of-information" class="anchor" href="#2-use-of-information"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. USE OF INFORMATION</h3>

<p>Main use of the non personally identifiable information is to continuously improve the Woisio Service. By looking at the statistics derived from the information we collected, we can see what is working, what is not and act on it.</p>

<p>Woisio uses your personally identifiable information primarily to provide you with the services (as personalized as possible) on the Woisio Service. The information is also used to verify your authority to access the Woisio Service, post content, write comments, vote, bid for / buy air times, upload / edit / delete / air content and to contact you when reasonably necessary. </p>

<p>Woisio may also use any information you have provided as reasonably necessary to administer or provide customer support for the Woisio Service, and to provide you with periodic printed or e-mail communications about new products and services, discounts, special promotions or upcoming events. You may opt-out of receiving some or all optional communications (when and if they exist) by updating your profile on the Woisio Service. (You can not opt-out of some very important communications like reset password e-mails, verification e-mails etc.) </p>

<p>Also, your full name and email address may be used when you use the Woisio Service to send a message or an invitation to another user. Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of other friends on the site (such as when another user sends you a message or invites you to join a conversation).</p>

<p>Woisio may use your facebook and/or twitter username and required account information to post (shares, likes, check ins, etc) on your behalf (if you authorize Woisio to do so)</p>

<p>Woisio may also use your personally identifiable information to enter you into any sweepstakes, giveaway or contest conducted by Woisio (may be through business partners or third parties on behalf of Woisio). However; if you win (pending your acceptance of the Official Rules), none of your information will be published (name, username, location etc.) until you agree to the Official Rules of that specific sweepstakes, giveaway or contest. If you choose not to agree to the Official Rules of that specific promotion; Woisio will select a new winner per Official Rules and your information will not be published with this regard.</p>
