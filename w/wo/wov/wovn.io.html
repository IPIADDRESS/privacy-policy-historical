    <h2>Section I. Definitions.</h2>
    <p>For the duration of this privacy policy, the following terms have the following definitions and meanings:</p>
    <p>Cookie – A small piece of data sent from a website and stored in a user's browser (e.g. Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer) while the user is browsing that website.</p>
    <p>Encrypted hash – A method of storing a password which is considered practically impossible to invert, that is, to recreate the input data from its hash value alone rather than a simple encryption. In other words, it is very secure.</p>
    <p>Hosting – The process of uploading your data to our servers so it can be stored and displayed in many different languages.</p>
    <p>Information - Information you provide us or information we collect from you that could be used to personally identify you. Examples include IP addresses, name, email address, etc. Additionally, this is what the primary focus of this document is.</p>

    <p>JavaScript – A standard software programming language used on most modern websites.</p>
    <p>Metadata - Provides information about a certain item's content. For example, an website may include metadata that describes how large the picture is, the color depth, the image resolution, when the image was created, and other data.</p>

This privacy policy is the same, regardless of any language. Please note that in the event of any differences in meaning or interpretation between the original English version of this Privacy Policy and a translation, the original English version takes precedence.

Your information is important to you and your privacy is important to us.</p>
    <p>While we make every effort to secure your information, there may be extreme unauthorized exceptions (such as digital piracy or illegal violations of our policy). In such circumstances we will make every effort to protect your information to the best of our ability and comply with the law of your applicable country when necessary.</p>
