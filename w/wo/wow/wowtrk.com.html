We request that all affiliates and                       merchants/advertisers read this policy in order to better                       understand how the information you provide to us and that we                       may otherwise collect may be used. If you have any queries                       relating to this policy, please do not hesitate to contact us                       at support@wowmedia.eu.<br> 
                  <br>

We collect information based on the following criteria:<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp; 1. You are a registered WOW Trk Affiliates merchant,<br> 
&nbsp; 2. You are a registered WOW Trk Affiliates affiliate, or<br> 
&nbsp; 3. You have applied to become a registered merchant or                       affiliate.<br> 
<br> 
If you are one of these three users, when you register and                       start using any of our sites located at <a onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://www.wowtrk.com" target="_blank"> www.wowtrk.com</a> and <a href="http://www.wowtrk.co.uk"> www.wowtrk.co.uk</a> (the "Site"), we require relevant program                       information, including but not limited to log-in, contact,                       company, website, website user and payment data in order to                       manage your account and provide you with the services                       requested. In addition once you are a member of WOW Trk                       Affiliates, we require sales and earnings data, and we collect                       performance statistics related to your WOW Trk Affiliates                       affiliate program(s) in order to properly compensate our                       users. Information is collected by WOW Trk Affiliates but is                       the sole property of the advertiser and is shared only with                       the advertiser.<br> 
<br> 
Contacting us with a question: When you contact us with a                       question or suggestion, we may collect your name, e-mail                       address and any comments you have. We only use this                       information to respond to and/or resolve your<br> 
question or concern.<br> 
<br> 
Information collected by Cookies. We do not collect data while                       you browse our public pages of the Site although WOW Trk                       Affiliates uses cookies to track leads and sales for the                       purpose of properly compensating affiliates. When a web                       visitor views an affiliate page and clicks on a merchant link,                       a cookie is placed on the visitor's hard drive. If the visitor                       performs a prescribed action (for example, signing up for a                       newsletter) or buys something, the cookie records their                       action. If the visitor revisits the merchant's site and buys                       anything else, the cookie will also track subsequent sales and                       credit the appropriate affiliate (depending on the<br> 
cookie's specified duration). We are collecting this                       information in order to track customers or sales.<br> 
WOW Trk Affiliates does not intentionally use cookies to track                       personal information. However, systems of some partner                       merchants may use portions of personal information (in the                       form of a customer or order ID) to track<br> 
customers or sales. A merchant may choose to pass WOW Trk                       Affiliates the ID, but without any other identifying/related                       information. WOW Trk Affiliates does nothing to prevent the                       disabling or blocking of<br> 
cookies. If a visitor chooses to disable or block cookies, any                       leads or sales the visitor makes will not be able to be                       tracked.<br> 
<br> 
When We Disclose Information<br> 
We share specific information only with registered WOW Trk                       Affiliates merchants and affiliates in order for them to make                       educated decisions while forming affiliations. Merchants and                       affiliates who are considering<br> 
forming an affiliation may view pertinent company, contact and                       performance information, and they may contact each other to                       solicit affiliation or find out additional details. After an                       affiliation has been formed, we<br> 
share sales and performance information necessary to calculate                       commission payments from merchants to affiliates. In addition,                       merchants may email or contact existing affiliates with                       potential offers and news.<br> 
<br> 
Occasionally we may share category information or general user                       statistics with potential partners. No personal identifying                       information will be included in such information and your                       identity will remain absolutely anonymous.<br> 
<br> 
How We Protect Your Information<br> 
We employ a number of safeguards to protect your information.                       Every user creates a unique password that only the user knows.                       You should never share your password and take usual                       recommended precautions (use a combination of numbers, letters                       and upper- and lowercase; change your password periodically).                       Particularly sensitive information, such as commission and                       earnings information are only available to the directly                       associated<br> 
merchant and affiliate(s), and some information can only be                       accessed by system administrators. Our servers are backed up                       daily and our web hosting features triple redundancy.<br> 
<br> 
Sharing and Selling Data<br> 
WOW Trk Affiliates does not share or sell your data to                       unaffiliated third parties. It does share data with member                       merchants and affiliates, as outlined in "When We Disclose                       Information," in order for merchants and affiliates to make                       informed decisions about the affiliations they make.<br> 
<br> 
In addition, from time to time, we may share non-user                       specific, aggregate information, or company names for the                       purpose of educating potential merchants and affiliates. No                       personal identifying information will be included in such                       information and your identity will remain absolutely                       anonymous.<br> 
<br> 
Finally, in case required by law, we may disclose personal                       information.<br> 
<br>

Unless restricted by law, we will                       take all reasonable steps to functionally delete such                       information from our database(s), although we may keep a copy                       for archival purposes for as long as necessary in our opinion.                       We will respond to your request to access, update or delete                       your information within thirty (30) business days.<br> 
<br> 
Surveys<br> 
Occasionally, WOW Trk Affiliates may conduct voluntary surveys                       for its own business development purposes. The results of                       these surveys may be shared or disclosed, but company- or                       website-specific data will not be released<br> 
without first securing necessary written consent.<br> 
<br>
