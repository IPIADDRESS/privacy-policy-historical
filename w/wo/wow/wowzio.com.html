  <h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:10px;">Protecting your privacy</h2>
  We don't share your information with third parties for marketing purposes.

  policies of each and every website visited.

  <h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:10px;">Data we collect</h2>
  We collect your email address at the time of registration, for purposes such as login, sending

  We may collect personal information if you provide it in profile, registration, feedback or
  comments, post it on our interactive forums, or if you 
  contact us directly. Please do not post or provide any personal information on 
  Wowzio's that you expect to keep private. 
  Our web logs collect standard web log entries for each page served, 
     including your IP address, page URL, and timestamp. Web logs help us to 
      diagnose problems with our server, to administer the Wowzio site, and to otherwise provide our service to you. 
      We use <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>
      for tracking and reporting. For more information, please see <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">http://www.google.com/analytics/</a>.

    <h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:10px;">Data we store</h2>
      We store blog posts as well as thumbnails of images in blog posts, to present and publish them in our widgets. If you are a blog owner, and would like us to stop doing this, please send us an email, clearly identifying yourself to info [at] wowzio [dot] com. Once we have verified ownership of the blog, we will deactivate all widgets related to your blog, and stop further distribution of your blog's content.
      All feedback is stored in our database, and feedback records are purged/deleted from time to time.
      Our web logs and other records are stored for the past 30 days.
