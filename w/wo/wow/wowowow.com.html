                <p>The following Privacy Policy governs the online information  collection practices of The Women on The Net Inc.. We have developed  this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to protecting any  information we gather about you while you are using wowowow.com. The  Policy describes the type of information we collect from you, how that  information may be used and shared and what steps are taken to protect  it. Please carefully review our information collection practices and  privacy protections below.<br>
<strong><br>
Publicly Shared Information</strong></p>

We reserve the right to review materials posted in any public  areas and to delete or edit them, for any reason, at any time.<br>
<strong><br>
Information You Provide to Us</strong></p>
<p>The only personal information this website obtains about you is  information voluntarily provided by you through our website.

When you  provide us with your personal registration information you may have the  option of informing us that you would like to receive promotional offers  from us and/or third parties.

If you choose to receive these promotional offers, your information may  be used for direct mail or email marketing.</p>
