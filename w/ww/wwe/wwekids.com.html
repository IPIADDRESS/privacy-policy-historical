<div class="index" id="GENERAL">General</div>
WWEKids.com is the place in cyberspace where young fans of WWE can come to find out more about their favorite WWE superstars. WWEKids.com believes in the power of children and we urge both children and their parents to use and enjoy our website. We encourage the interactive use of online media, but we also strive to educate parents and children about how to guard their privacy and safety when traveling on the Web. WWEKids.com is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (â€œCOPPAâ€).  Our information collection practices are described below. We urge children to check with their parents before entering information on any website and we urge parents to discuss with their children restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know. 
<br><br>

<div class="index" id="What">What Information Is Collected?</div>


At WWEKids.com, it's our policy to create website content that requires minimum collection of information from our visitors. Generally, WWEKids.com limits our collection of information from children to information that does not identify them personally. Children can participate in activities at WWEKids.com (e.g., play online games and see videos) without giving unnecessary personal information. In the future, however, we may request limited personally identifiable information (e.g. child's email address and/or email address of parent or third party) so that the child may receive electronic newsletters and engage in other activities. WWEKids.com does not condition a child's participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. 
<br><br>

<div class="index" id="Future">Future Functions</div>

In the future WWEKids.com may offer the ability to enter online contests and sweepstakes and to send electronic postcards featuring WWE characters or original artwork to family or friends. Also, WWEKids.com may offer information about products that children are interested in and are able to purchase.  This Site may also provide Users with the ability to send email messages to family and/or friends to let family and/or friends share their interest. WWEKids.com may also provide the opportunity to send e-mail to us. Lastly, WWEKids.com may offer the ability for children to receive a WWEKids.com newsletter by email. Some of these Future Functions activities may be provided through third-party service providers. However, these functions are not active at this time.  
<br><br>

<div class="index" id="Use">Use and Disclosure of Information</div>

WWEKids.com may use personally identifiable information that children would provide for implementing the Future Functions described above. In the event that all or substantially all of the assets relating to WWEKids.com are transferred or sold to another entity, personally identifiable information submitted to us may be transferred to the acquiring entity. We would also disclose personally identifiable information to third parties in order to comply with law or requests by law enforcement agencies, to enforce our <a style="font-size:16px;text-decoration:underline;font-weight:normal;" href="/content/media/legal/terms.html" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions</a> or to protect the rights, property or safety of our website, users of our website and others.

<div class="index" id="Cookies">Cookies and Log Data</div>

Cookies are information files that your web browser places on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. Cookies cannot damage user files, nor can they read information from a user's hard drive. Cookies allow websites to "remember" usersâ€™ activities on a website as well as usersâ€™ visits to a site. At WWEKids.com, cookies are used to determine the number of unique visitors to our website over a given period. Cookies will also be used in a future upgrade to WWEKids.com to remember user screen names so that the need for multiple log-ins is eliminated. We do not store any personal information into cookies nor do we link or combine information collected through cookies to any personal information that children submit online when participating in our activities. You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser.
<br><br>
The ads appearing on WWEKids.com are delivered to you by a third party ad service provider. In the course of serving ads, the ad service provider may place or recognize their own unique cookie on your browser, and may use non-personally identifiable information about your visit to WWEKids.com, such as the number of times that you have viewed an ad. 
<br><br>
Log data collected on web servers both within WWEKids.com's control and under the control of WWEKids.com's third party ad service provider, which is required to maintain such data on a confidential basis, supplies WWEKids.com with aggregate information about the number of visits to different pages on our site. WWEKids.com uses such aggregate information to improve access to our content based on our visitors' browsers and operating system types to make our content available to as many children as possible. We do not link the log data collected to the personal information that children submit online when participating in our activities. 
<br><br>
Aggregated usage data enables us to tailor our content to our visitors' interests and to help our advertisers better understand the preferences of our audience. Providing such usage data to advertisers is essential to keeping as many of our services free to visitors as is reasonably possible. This information does not reveal your identity although, in some cases, we may have to combine this non-identifiable information with Personal Information to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or to protect our services, web sites, visitors or others.
