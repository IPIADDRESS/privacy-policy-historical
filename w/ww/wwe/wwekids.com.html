<p>            Updated 9/21/12 </p>             

<h3>            Introduction</h3>

<p>            The website you have entered is owned and operated by, or on behalf of, WWE, Inc. or its affiliates (collectively, "WWE", "we" or "us").
            Please note that this Privacy Policy contains capitalized words or phrases.  These words and phrases are defined terms.  Their definitions are found either in this Privacy Policy or in our Terms and Conditions of Use ("Terms of Use").  To help you use this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use we have made some words, phrases and headings into hyperlinks.  These words, phrases and headings have color highlighting.</p>
<p>            WWE wants to help you make the most of your visit to our websites, and that includes helping to protect your personal privacy. This Privacy Policy provides information about how this website collects and uses information about you.
</p>
<p>            By using this website, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any terms or practices described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use this website.</p>
<p>            As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information by which a particular natural person is reasonably identifiable.  Personal Information includes, for example a first name or initial and last name; a home or other physical address; a date of birth; an email address or other online contact information; or a telephone number.  In general, this website does not collect or use Personal Information about you.</p>
<h3>            Special Note to Parents</h3>
<p>            WWE is committed to providing special protection for the privacy of children who may visit our websites. We encourage parents to spend time online with their children, become familiar with the features of our websites and participate in the activities offered on our websites. For more information on getting involved in your children's online activities, please go to our <a href="http://corporate.wwe.com/parents/overview.jsp">WWE Parents site</a>. </p>
<p>            As previously indicated, we generally do not collect or use Personal Information about visitors to this website, whether or not the visitors are children.  We recommend that minors who are age 13 or older consult with their parents before sending any information about themselves over the internet.</p>
<p>            If you become aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information at one of our websites (e.g., one of our other websites), we invite you to notify us so that we may delete the information from our records and discontinue any related features or services (see "Contact Us" section below). We appreciate your cooperation in assisting us to provide a safe and enjoyable online experience for your children.</p>
<h3>            Cookies, Locally Shared Objects, and Other Technologies</h3>
<p>            In order to track your use of our websites, "cookies" are employed. We, and our affiliates and service providers, use two types of cookies -- so-called "browser cookies" and "Flash cookies". Browser cookies (also called "HTTP cookies") are pieces of information that are sent by websites and stored in your computer's hard drive. We and our affiliates and service providers may place browser cookies on your computer, and may access browser cookies and information about them.  Browser cookies allow us and our affiliates and service providers to learn how visitors use our websites. Browser cookies are used for tracking purposes, and they allow for the collection and use of information including what website pages were viewed throughout our websites, as well as information such as the Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses, browser types, and general geographic origin of the computer or other device used access to our websites and similar usage data. Flash cookies (also called "Locally Shared Objects" or "LSOs") may also used for all of these same purposes and/or to remember settings and preferences. However, Flash cookies are stored differently on your hard drive and may be managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. In general, Flash cookies are more persistent and can store more data that browser cookies.</p>
<p>            This website may use other technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, or other forms of local storage, including HTML5 local storage (collectively, "other technologies") in order to collect and track information (including the types of information described above) about individuals who access our websites.  Information collected from these types of technologies, and from cookies and Flash cookies, is collectively referred to as "Website Usage Data."    </p>
<p>            Website Usage Data enables us to tailor our content to our visitors' interests and to help our affiliates better understand the preferences of our audience. In general, we do not use Website Usage Data to personally identify you.</p>
<p>            If you do not want to receive browser cookies, you may be able to set your browser to reject them. If you wish to disable or delete Flash cookies, you should consult the Help file for your Flash application, and/or visit <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html</a>. However, if you turn cookies off (whether browser or Flash cookies), you may not have access to some WWE features and services. The other technologies that our websites use may not be able to be disabled; if you are concerned about this, you should not use our websites.</p>
