      <span class="bodytext">Last updated 04/12/02<p>The web site you have entered is operated by, or on behalf of, WWE ,Inc. or its subsidiaries (“WWE”). </p><p><b>Introduction</b> <br>
WWE wants to help you make the most of your visit to our web sites, and that includes helping to protect your personal privacy.  Most of the features on our web sites are offered without collecting any Personal Information from you.  You can surf WWE’s web sites and view much of our content anonymously.  For those areas of our web sites and services that do require us to collect Personal Information, this Privacy Policy will tell you what you need to know to make good decisions for yourself and your family.</p><p>This Privacy Policy discloses when and how we collect, use, share, and safeguard information from this web site.  The Personal Information we collect depends on what you do when you visit our sites or use the various products or services we offer.  This Privacy Policy also explains what to do if you do not want to provide Personal Information when you visit our web sites, and how to correct or change information you have already provided to us.  </p><p>By using this web site, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy, as posted in this area of the site.  If you do not agree with any terms or practices described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use our web sites.</p><p>As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means personally identifiable information, such as your name, street address, telephone number, date of birth and e-mail address.  When Personal Information is collected, you will know because you will have to fill out a form on the web site.  When you make a purchase, or sign up for a paid service, we will also collect your credit card information as additional Personal Information.  We will use credit card information only to complete the transactions you have requested.  </p><p><b>Children</b><br>
WWE is committed to providing special protection for the privacy of children who may visit our web sites.  WWE is also committed to fully complying with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).

- We do not request any visitor to provide any information about their family members, friends or other persons.<br>
- We do not allow visitors who are age 12 or younger to be listed in any directory of registered users, to participate in any of our chat services, to register for contests, sweepstakes, promotions, or newsletters, or to receive direct marketing from WWE or from our third-party affiliates or service or product providers. </p><p><b>Special Note to Parents</b><br>
If you become aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information at one of our web sites, we invite you to notify us so that we may delete the information from our records and discontinue any related features or services (see Opt-Out below).

- Purchases of merchandise (including magazine subscriptions), Streaming Pay Per View events, and transactions where home delivery is required.<br>
- E-mail transmitted via various links on our web sites.</p><p>The use of any of these services is entirely optional and voluntary; however, if you do not provide the Personal Information requested, we may elect to not make the related services available for your use.  If you send us an e-mail in which you disclose Personal Information, we will use it to discuss the subject of your correspondence and, if appropriate, share it with other interested parties (such as manufacturers of merchandise you have purchased from a web site).  </p><p>If you send us an e-mail, you should know that e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception.  So, if your communication needs to include sensitive information like your bank account, credit card, or social security number, please contact us by postal mail or telephone (see Contact Us, below) rather than e-mail.</p><p><b>Cookies</b><br>
In order to track your use of the site, "cookies" may be employed.  Cookies are pieces of information that are sent by web sites and stored in your computer's hard drive, which provide you a service by allowing us to recognize your computer to save you from having to re-enter the same data every time you visit our web sites.  They also allow us to learn how visitors use our web sites.  This user data is aggregated for tracking purposes primarily by tallying pages viewed throughout our web sites and logging Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses and browser types.  </p><p>Aggregated usage data enables us to tailor our content to our visitors’ interests and to help our advertisers better understand the preferences of our audience.  Providing such usage data to advertisers is essential to keeping as many of our services free to visitors as is reasonably possible.  This information does not reveal your identity although, in some cases, we may have to combine this non-identifiable information with Personal Information to enforce compliance with our Terms of Service or to protect our service, web sites, visitors or others.</p><p>In the course of serving advertisements to the site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.</p><p>If you do not want to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject them.

If you have registered with us and do not want to be contacted in the future by WWE or our advertising partners, please see Opt-Out below.</p><p>If you order a product or service from us or register for one of our contests, promotions, or interactive services, WWE may share Personal Information with service providers, suppliers and other third parties (for example, sweepstakes sponsors or delivery services) that assist us in operating the web sites or providing the products or services.  When we share your Personal Information with third parties, they may use your Personal Information to send you information on their additional products or services, but WWE does not allow them to sell or transfer your Personal Information to others.  We do not otherwise sell or provide your Personal Information to third parties.  </p><p>Finally, please note that we will release your Personal Information if required to do so by law, or by search warrant, subpoena or court order. </p><p><b>Links to Third Party Web Sites</b><br>
