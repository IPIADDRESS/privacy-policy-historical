<div class="item">

	<div class="content">
		<div class="text">WWF-Canada is committed to protecting the privacy of our members, employees,  supporters and other stakeholders. WWF-Canada values the trust of our supporters  and recognizes that maintaining this requires that we be accountable and  transparent in how we treat the information you have chosen to share with us.<br>
<br>
In our quest to spread environmental awareness, raise funds for wildlife and  build a strong constituency, we frequently gather and use personal information.  WWF-Canada complies with and endeavours to exceed the legal requirements of  Canada's federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.  The personal information of our supporters is always held in the strictest of  confidence and any use of this information is subject to consent.</div>
	</div>

</div>


<div class="item">

	<div class="content"><h3>Personal Information</h3>
		<div class="text">Personal information is any information that can be used to distinguish,  identify or contact a specific individual. This information can include an  individual's name, contact information, opinions, social status and family  relationships.<br>
<br>
Exceptions include business-related information and certain publicly available  information such as business address, name, title and fax. Where an individual  uses his or her home contact information as business contact information as  well, we consider that the contact information provided is business contact  information. <br>
<br>
<strong>What Personal Information do we collect?</strong> <br>
<br>
We collect and maintain different types of personal information about individuals with whom we interact which is relevant for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate for a donor-charity relationship.  <br>
<br>
This includes: <br>
<br>
· Contact and identification information, such as your name, address, telephone number, mobile number and e-mail address;  <br>
· Donation information such as date of gift, amount of gift, appeal (the campaign you contributed to), name of spouse or partner if it was a joint gift; receipt number.  <br>
· Financial information such as your payment methods and preferences, billing and banking information (credit card number and expiry date or chequing account transit numbers, whichever payment type you prefer in order to process your donation);  <br>
· Product and service related information concerning the sale of apparel, books and gifts and other products or services that we provide to you;  <br>
· Other personal information used for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in light of the circumstances.  <br>
<br>
<strong>Why Do We Collect Personal Information?</strong> <br>
<br>
WWF-Canada collects personal information to further its fundraising and public education and advocacy commitments, as well as to establish, maintain and manage our relationship with you. Certain information is collected to satisfy the requirements of Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA).  <br>
<br>
<strong>How do we Use Your Personal Information?</strong> <br>
<br>
We will not, without your consent, use your personal information for any purpose other than as described in this Privacy Policy, except where permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirements. We use your personal information for fundraising, to process donations, to respond to requests for information and to periodically keep you informed and up to date on WWF-Canada’s conservation activities and campaigns. If you subscribe to our electronic newsletter (Panda Mail) on our Web site (www.wwf.ca), in addition, we use your personal information to send you special offers and updates, service announcements relating to our Web site and to invite you to participate in surveys or contests.
<br><br>
<strong>Sharing of Personal Information</strong>
<br><br>
Third party service providers may be engaged by WWF-Canada to perform a variety of functions, such as to mail our brochures, to process your donation, to fulfill your order or to provide technical services for our Web site, etc. These third party providers have access to personal information if needed to perform the functions for which they are retained. However, we direct that those companies may only use such personal information for the purpose of performing their roles and may not use it for any other purpose. In these cases, when information is shared, WWF-Canada will demand reasonable assurance that the third parties will protect your information in conformity with our privacy practices.

	<div class="content"><h3>Privacy Practices</h3>
		<div class="text">The privacy of our supporter's personal information is never compromised.  Safeguards are in place to ensure that all personal information is kept  confidential and secure. Access is only given to employees who must use the  personal information for the reason for which it was obtained. Measures are in  place to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the information we have.<br>
<br>
We collect, use and disclose personal information only for purposes that a  reasonable person would consider appropriate. Regularly, our members are given  opportunities to choose how often and in what way they wish to hear from us. At  any time, our supporters are able to opt out of receiving communication  material. Also, our supporters are able to opt out of having their information  used or shared for purposes beyond those for which it was collected.</div>
