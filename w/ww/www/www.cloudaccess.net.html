<h5>Information Relating to Children</h5>
<h3 class="plain-text"></h3>
<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age. The CloudAccess.net Sites, Products, and Services are not directed at children under 13 years of age, but we recognize that with proper adult supervision some parents might permit their children to visit and utilize the CloudAccess.net Sites, Products, and Services. COPPA requires that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of the CloudAccess.net Sites, Products, and Services.</p>
<ul class="plain-text">
</ul>
<ul class="plain-text">
</ul>
<p class="plain-text">When your child attempts to register and/or provide personal information to cloudaccess.net (including on any of the CloudAccess.net Sites, Products, and Services), we require a parent or legal guardian to: complete the registration; review our privacy policy and to submit a valid credit card number to verify that the child's parent or guardian knows about and authorizes our information practices related to children protected by COPPA; and verify through the use of an email confirmation and second authorization that the parent or guardian consents to any applicable Terms of Service and this privacy policy.</p>
<p class="plain-text">Once parental notice and consent has been verified, the information we collect will be treated the same as information collected from any other user of the CloudAccess.net Sites, Products, and Services. Without verified parental notice and consent, we will not knowingly collect personal information of children under 13 years of age, and if we learn that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will promptly delete it.</p>
<p class="plain-text">&nbsp;</p>
<h5 class="plain-text">How Parents Can Access their Children's Personal Information</h5>
<p class="plain-text">In compliance with COPPA, parents and legal guardians may request us to review, delete, or stop the collection of the personally identifiable information of their child. You may do so in one of two ways:</p>
<p class="plain-text">If you know the user name and password, follow the instructions below regarding Changing your Preferences and Personal Information, or you may contact us by letter, phone, or email, using the address information provided at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p class="plain-text">If you request that no further information about your child be collected or used, we will be required to terminate your child's ability to use the CloudAccess.net Sites, Products, and Services that require a user to "sign in."</p>
<p class="plain-text">&nbsp;</p>
<h5 class="plain-text">Information Use, Sharing, and Disclosure</h5>
The CloudAccess.net Sites, Products, and Services do not share personal information we learn about you from your use of the Web sites, products, and services with others, except as described in this policy. We do not share your information with unrelated third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, the CloudAccess.net Sites, Products, and Services may display targeted advertisements based on personal information.<br><br>When you provide personal information through using the CloudAccess.net Sites, Products, and Services you are, however, sharing your personal information with CloudAccess.net and its affiliated entities.

<p>The CloudAccess.net Sites, Products, and Services may share personally identifiable information about you under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>In the course of operating our business it may be necessary or appropriate for us to provide access to your personal information to others, such as our service providers, contractors, and select vendors so that we can operate the CloudAccess.net Sites, Products, and Services and our business.
