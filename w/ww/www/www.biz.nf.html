    <li type="1"><b>Legal basis for processing personal information</b><br>
        <br>
        Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.<br>
        <br>
        However, we will normally collect personal information from you only:<br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>where we have your consent to do so;</li>
            <br>
            <li>where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights;</li>
            <br>
            <li>where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        We have a legitimate interest in operating our Services and communicating with you when necessary to provide these Services. In example, when improving our platform, undertaking marketing, responding to your queries, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.<br>
        <br>
        In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.<br>
        <br>
        In case we need you to provide personal information to us to perform a contract with you or to comply with a legal requirement, we will make this clear at the relevant time and explain whether your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

    <li type="1"><b>Securing your data</b><br>
        <br>
        We are committed to protecting your data and personal information. We employ a variety of security measures and technologies, that are designed to defend against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Please bear in mind that the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

    </li>
    <br>
    <li type="1"><b>Keeping your data</b><br>

        <br>
        If we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either anonymize or delete it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. 
    </li>
    <br>
    <li type="1"><b>Management over the data we have for you</b><br>

The information you provide us may be archived or stored periodically by us according to backup processes conducted in the ordinary course of business for disaster recovery purposes. Your ability to access and correct your information may be temporarily limited where access and correction could:<br>
