<h3 id="consent-and-information-collection-and-use">Consent and Information Collection and Use</h3>

<p>When you join us as a user of our Services, we ask for personal information that will be used to activate your account, provide the Services to you, communicate with you about the status of your account, and for other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Your name, company name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information and certain other information about you may be required by us to provide the Services or disclosed by you during your use of the Services.

Without limiting the foregoing, we may on occasion ask you to consent when we collect, use, or disclose your personal information in specific circumstances. Sometimes your consent will be implied through your conduct with us if the purpose of the collection, use or disclosure is obvious and you voluntarily provide the information.</p>

<p>We may use your personal or account information for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>To provide the Services to you and to improve the quality of the Site and Services,</li>
<li>To provide information to you so that you may use the Site and Services more effectively,</li>
<li>To create, manage and control your account information, and to verify access rights to services and software,</li>
<li>To bill your account,</li>

We will use this information to deliver relevant content and services to you. This also allows us to make sure that visitors see the website they expect to see if they return to the same web URL and it allows us to tell you how many people click on your website.</p>

<h3 id="change-of-ownership-or-business-transition">Change of Ownership or Business Transition</h3>

<p>In the event of a change of ownership or other business transition, such as a merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your information may be transferred in accordance with applicable privacy laws.</p>
