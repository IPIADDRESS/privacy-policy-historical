<h2>TN MARKETING PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>TNM has developed this Privacy Policy which details important information regarding the use and disclosure of user information collected on TNM owned or controlled websites, mobile sites and applications, and related services, communications and tools that link to this Privacy Policy, and when you interact offline with TNM regarding those sites, applications and related services and tools (collectively referred to as the “Services”). TNM provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue to use the Services and the choices we offer for you to manage the information we collect related to the use of the Services. Each time that you access or use the Services, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy or Terms of Service (“Terms”), which are incorporated into this Privacy Policy by reference and govern your use of our Services, please discontinue accessing or using the Services. </p>
<p><a name="Information"></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Information Collected Directly From You.</strong><br>
You can browse our Services without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information including but not limited to your name, email address, phone number, mobile telephone number, credit card information or physical contact information about yourself. If you create an account, contact us or purchase any of our Services you choose to give us your personal information and are not anonymous to us. When you register an account, or use certain of our Services you may provide certain additional information such as username and e-mail address. You may also provide payment information such as credit or debit card information, name and billing address to purchase a membership, series, collections or libraries. </p>
<p><strong>Information Imported from Social Networks. </strong><br>
We will collect information from you when you interact with our Services through third party social networking services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+) (each and collectively, a “Social Network”). You may also have the option to consent to connecting your activity on our Services with your Social Network information and activity. If you permit a connection, we and that Social Network may be able to identify you and associate information received pursuant to the connection with information we already have about you. Please review the Social Network’s privacy policy and choices for sharing information of any Social Network connected to our Services. </p>
<p><strong>Surveys and Promotions. </strong><br>
From time-to-time we may request information from you and other users via surveys, or contests, sweepstakes or other promotions. Participation is completely voluntary. Information collected may be used as set forth in this Privacy Policy and as set forth in the applicable terms or official rules, including without limitation to notify the winners and award prizes, and file winners’ information as required by law. Survey information will be used for the purposes of the survey. </p>
<p><strong>Information You Post/Social Networks. </strong><br>
The Services are designed to enable you to communicate with others and any information or content you post when participating with the Services and Social Networks, plug ins or other applications becomes public information, depending upon your privacy settings, and is subject to redistribution by TNM and other third parties. There is no expectation of privacy when posting content or otherwise participating in such interactive forums and we have no control over how those users may use the information you make public. Therefore, you should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting. </p>
<p><strong>Mobile Devices. </strong><br>
We may collect additional information from you if you access Services through a mobile device; for example, your unique device identifier, device’s operating system, mobile carrier, location, and if you opt-in, geo-location. We may also collect your location information from your IP address or zip code. We may also use location data internally or in conjunction with our third party service providers to customize your experience and provide offers that may be relevant to you. The degree to which your location can be identified depends on the device you are using, e.g. laptop, smartphone, tablet or other access device (each a “Device”) and how you are connected to the internet (e.g. via cable broadband connection, WiFi, etc.). </p>
<p><strong>Information about Others/Inviting Friends. </strong><br>
From time to time you may choose to submit personal information about other people to invite them to join a Service. Inviting friends is always optional. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the Services, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend. </p>
<p><a name="TrackingTechnologies"></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tracking Technologies. </strong><br>
In addition to any information that you choose to submit to us, we and our business partners may use a variety of <a href="/tracking-technologies/">tracking technologies</a> such as cookies, flash cookies, web beacons/GIFs, HTML5, embedded scripts, e-tags/cache browsers/web logs (“Tracking Technologies”), that automatically (or passively) collect certain information from your Device whenever you visit or interact with the Services or third party websites. This information may include your Device identifier, the type and version of Internet browser software you use, and your operating system. We may also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and connection information. During some visits, we may use these tools to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages and page interaction information. Certain features of our Services are only available through the use of Tracking Technologies. You may encounter tracking technologies/cookies from our third party service providers that we have allowed on our Services who assist us with various aspects of our operations and Services. You may find out more information about these third parties and their practices and your choices for data collection by clicking <a href="/third-party-providers-of-analytics-tools/">here</a>. Tracking Technologies are used for a variety of purposes, including the following:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operationally Necessary. </strong><br>
	We may use Tracking Technologies for system administration, to prevent fraudulent activity, to improve security or to allow you to make use of our Services.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Related. </strong><br>
	We may use Tracking Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to improve content offered through the Services.</li>
<li><strong>Functionality Related. </strong><br>
	We may use Tracking Technologies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Services before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify the features in which you may have the greatest interest.</li>
<li><strong>Targeting Related. </strong><br>
	We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on the Services and third party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content, as well as to track the content you access.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Location and Geo-location Functionality.</strong><br>
Information gathered from your use of the Services may be combined with information from third-party sources to identify your location by state and region (“Regional Location”). If you enable location services for our Services we may collect regional location data periodically as you use or leave open our Services. Certain of our mobile applications have search functionality that gathers aggregate location data about visitors and when visitors opt in, allows us to collect information about their precise geographic location (“Geo-location”). We may use GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cell tower proximity to determine geo-location. If you agree to have your Geo-location collected, we may use and retain that precise location data to provide you with information about our Services or carry out marketing and other activities contemplated by our mobile applications and by this Policy. When you have Geo-location software running on your Device, we may only collect that information as controlled by your privacy settings on your Device. For most mobile Devices, you are able to withdraw your permission for us to acquire this information on your location through the Device settings. If you have questions about how to disable your mobile Device’s location services, we recommend you contact your mobile Device service provider or the Device manufacturer.  </p>
<p><a name="TargetedAdvertising"></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. TARGETED ADVERTISING. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Interest Based Advertising. </strong><br>
We may use Tracking Technologies to collect information about your visits over time and across the Services and other third party web sites, as well as information received from other sources, in order to serve more targeted advertising to you. To serve our ads, we use a variety of third party advertising service providers, including networks, data exchanges, ad servers, analytics providers and others. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies to send directly to your Device the advertisements and links that appear on the Services. They automatically receive your Device identifier when this happens. Their tools may also limit the number of times you see the same ad and help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. These third parties may also use information gathered from your use of the Services to serve targeted, interest based advertisements to you on third party websites and applications. Some of the advertising service providers may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. If you opt out of receiving targeted ads in this manner, you will continue to receive advertising messages, but they will not be customized to you based on your use of the Services and third party websites. If you would like more information about advertisers’ use of tracking technologies and about your option not to accept them, you can go to <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>. To learn more about how interest-based information is collected, whether the companies we use are part of an industry network regarding behavioral advertising, or to know your choices about not having information used in this manner, you can go to <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info</a>. Please note that the opt-out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer or mobile application, and browser or operating system, on which the opt-out is applied. You can also accept or decline cookies through your browser settings. To learn more, please look at the cookie settings available in your specific web browser(s).  </p>
<p><strong>Browser “Do Not Track” Signals</strong><br>
Some third party browsers provide “do not track” machine readable signals for websites, which are automatically applied by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitors’ choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result, we do not respond to these signals.  </p>
<p><a name="PersonalInformation"></a></p>
