<h2>Intellisync Corporation's Online Privacy Policy</h2>

<p><b>What this Privacy Policy Covers</b> </p>
<p>This document sets forth Intellisync Corporation's Online Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") for this Web site, www.pumatech.com (the "Site"). If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or use this Site.</p>

<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Intellisync Corporation does not own or control, or to people that Intellisync Corporation does not employ or manage. The Site contains links to other sites at which personal information is collected. In such instances, unless expressly provided to the contrary, the collection and use of your personal information will be governed by the privacy policy applicable to that site. You should review the privacy policy of such sites before using the sites.</p>


<p><b>Information Collection</b> </p>

<p>All personal information (any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains) that we collect and maintain will be subject to the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of such collection. Intellisync Corporation collects personally identifiable information when you purchase product from our Web store, and during product registration including: your name, address, email, billing information (such as credit card), or other information from which your identity may be reasonably ascertained. The personal information collected from 
users during these processes is used for billing purposes, setup of products and services requested, and product support. </p>

<p>When ordering products or services on the Site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number and, depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is mandatory and voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to the online activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.</p>

<p>Occasionally, we conduct online surveys on the Site that are entirely voluntary. The information collected here is used to improve our understanding of customer needs and product development.</p>

<p><b>Information Use</b> </p>
<p>Intellisync Corporation uses the information collected for these general purposes: to 
administer billing, to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. If you voluntarily enter a contest, information is collected to qualify entry and contact you in regards to applicable awards. Your personal information is also used to keep you informed of product upgrades, special offers, and important changes to products or services rendered. Upon receipt of these communications, users are provided the option to unsubscribe from receiving future communications from Intellisync Corporation.</p>

<p>Users of the My Mind-it and Mind-it for Webmasters services will receive notification alerts when a Web page they are tracking changes, is moved or is no longer available, and/or when the Web page they are 
tracking does not have any activity for 30 days. Due to the nature of their services, a separate Privacy Policy has been posted and can be viewed at <a href="http://www.mymindit.com/privacy.html"><u>www.mymindit.com/privacy.html</u></a>. </p>



<p><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b> </p>
<p>Intellisync Corporation occasionally conducts online surveys that will ask you to 
voluntarily disclose your demographic and other profile information (such as 
your first and last name, mailing address, email and other personal information). Your personally identifiable information 
will be used internally by Intellisync Corporation for the purpose of improving our product and 
service offerings and will not be shared with any third party. However, 
aggregated statistical usage information, like the number of users and services 
used, may be shared with third parties such as potential advertisers and 
partners. </p>

<p>Intellisync Corporation will send personally identifiable information about you to other 
companies or people when: (a) reasonably required to do so in order to maintain, 
update or otherwise implement data security measures, equipment, technical 
operations and the like on the Site, (b) reasonably 
necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities 
to preserve and/or enforce Intellisync Corporation's rights or (c) reasonably necessary to 
respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process. If Intellisync Corporation sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, or Intellisync Corporation (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by, or merged with, another entity, Intellisync Corporation may provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without your consent. </p>

<p>Any information you post to a public bulletin board or chat room, such as the Intellisync MobileApp Designer Message Board or Intellisync MobileApp Designer Yahoo Groups (the "Forums"), is available to all persons accessing that location. Your e-mail address will not automatically be posted on the Forums unless you modify the default setting to permit that. Your e-mail address would then be available to all persons accessing the Forums. In addition, you should be aware that some of the Forums offer a service in which subscribers are e-mailed a copy of all messages posted to the Forums on a particular topic. Consequently, if you post a message to the Forums, your e-mail address will be sent to those subscribers that have indicated an interest in the topic of your message.</p>
