<div class="maintxtnomargin">

Thank you for visiting WGBH Online.  As an extension of our broadcast mission, we want your visit to WGBH Online to enlighten, inform, and entertain you. We know you don't want the information you provide us shared indiscriminately. Here we explain how WGBH Online collects information, what we do with it, and what controls you have. We're committed to ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable information, and to protecting your ability to make financial transactions and transmit your personal data with full confidence. 
<br><br>


       	The privacy policy set forth here refers solely to WGBH Online. Please read it carefully, and if you have any questions or concerns, please contact us <link to="" contact="" us="" mainpage="">.  Also, note that WGBH Online links to numerous other sites, such as <a href="http://www.pbs.org/aboutsite/privacy.html"><b>PBS</b></a>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/inside/privacy.html"><b>NPR</b></a> and <a href="http://www.publicinteractive.com/company/user-privacy-policy.html"><b>Public Interactive</b></a>. Please consult those sites to learn more about their policies.
<br><br>
<br><br>	


<b>Gathering and Use of Information</b><br>
       	WGBH does not willfully disclose any personally identifiable information about our online visitors to any third party without first receiving the user's permission.  WGBH Online only collects personally identifiable information from our visitors on a voluntary basis (such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and/or other identifying information).
<br><br>


       	You should recognize that under certain circumstances, if you choose not to voluntarily submit requested information, you may not be able to engage in certain activities -- e.g., WGBH customization, accessing WGBH membership information, online contests -- for which personally identifiable information is needed. 
<br><br>
<br><br>

<!--  
Please see the WGBH Online Kids Privacy Policy <link to kids policy>for more information about our site guidelines in relation children. 
<br><br>  -->



<b>	Registration, Minimum Requirements, and Security</b><br>
	To serve you better, we offer visitors the opportunity to customize the Schedule and Around Town Calendar features of WGBH Online, to sign up for free e-mail services, and to gain access to information about their WGBH membership (if this applies) -- all by registering a user name and password. These services are free of charge, entirely optional, and designed to enhance your enjoyment of WGBH Online.
<br><br>


To administer these services we require a minimum of information from you. This includes a user name (your e-mail address), password, acknowledgment of whether you are 18 years of age or older, and information about your membership status at WGBH. Our Customize forms are stored and served from a secure server. This means that each page you view and any information you submit is encrypted on its way between computers (yours and ours). In the unlikely event that the information you send is intercepted, it should not be usable by anyone else. While no computer system is 100-percent secure, WGBH has taken reasonable steps to ensure the security of any information you provide to our Web site. 
<br><br>


Our goal is to offer service while adhering to the best security practices possible; to do so requires your shared cooperation and commitment. Thus, to participate in these optional services you agree to abide by the following terms and conditions:
<br><br>

<ul>
a)	All registration information submitted by you is accurate and updated.  
</ul>

<ul>
b)	You will not select or use an e-mail address of another person with the intent to impersonate that person.
</ul>

<ul>
c)	You will not use the e-mail address in which another person has rights without that person's authorization.
</ul>

<ul>
d)	You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. (Please know that if you choose to share your log-in and password, you are providing access to your private information.)
</ul>
<br><br>


<b>Secure Credit Card Transactions</b><br>
       WGBH Online offers you the convenience of making membership contributions via credit card. WGBH utilizes state-of-the-art measures to ensure credit card account information security and to secure any information from your computer to our server. Our Web financial transaction forms are stored and served from a secure server. This means that each page you view and any information you submit is encrypted on its way between computers (yours and ours). Even in the highly unlikely event that your transmission is intercepted, it should not be usable. Your peace of mind and the safeguarding of your credit card information are top priorities for us. All online credit card transactions are done through a secure server using 128-bit SSL; you know you're on a secure page when the Web address starts with "https" (the "s" is for "secure"). Your credit card information is used only for your intended purpose -- that is, for the purchase or contribution you wish to make.
<br><br>
<br><br>

<b>E-mail Addresses</b><br>
WGBH maintains a customer database with e-mail addresses of viewers, listeners, and Web visitors who have provided them to WGBH by registering at our site, e-mailing us with questions about membership, submitting an online membership contribution (that is, making an online pledge), or sending us an e-mail about our programs or services. We will use these addresses to send our constituents information about WGBH programs, Web sites, services, or membership, and we will always give you a clear and convenient method of unsubscribing to our mailings.  
<br><br>


E-mail addresses will be used only by WGBH to communicate with you. We do not sell, exchange, or lend e-mail addresses to outside companies, organizations, or individuals. You can have your e-mail address removed from the WGBH e-mail database at any time by either going to <a href="user/preferences"><b>Customize WGBH</b></a> and updating your preferences or by going to WGBH Online's <a href="contact"><b>Contact Us</b></a> page and using our Feedback form.  We will try to update our records as soon as possible, or by following the unsubscribe directions included in each and every e-mail message we send.  If you already have opted out, rest assured that we will continue to honor your request. 
<br><br>
<br><br>

<b>WGBH and Your Postal Address</b><br>
	Like many nonprofits, we occasionally exchange some of our donors' names and postal addresses with carefully selected nonprofit educational, cultural, health, and social service organizations. When you make an online contribution, your name and postal address will be included as eligible for an exchange. Please note that on every online contribution form, we give you the opportunity to opt out of having your name and address shared. We have not and do not share or exchange our donors' e-mail addresses or phone numbers with any third party. Our exchange program provides other nonprofits with only your name and postal address.
<br><br>


       If at any time you would like to check or update our record of your information, please let us know by using our <a href="user/preferences"><b>online form</b></a>, calling the WGBH Member Hotline (617-300-3300, Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm EST), or writing to us (WGBH, Box 200, Boston, MA 02134). If you already have opted out of having your name and address exchanged, rest assured that we will continue to honor your request.
<br><br>
<br><br>

<a name="cookie"></a><b>Cookies and Browsers</b><br>
        In general, "cookies" -- the informational files that your web browser places on your computer when you visit a Web site -- are used on WGBH Online to log in visitors who customize their use of our site and to remember e-mail log-in and password.  That way, you can choose not to type your user name and password every time you visit WGBH Online. To ensure your privacy, we recommend that you select "Remember my log-in" <i>only</i> if your computer is located in a secure area.  If you are using a shared computer (such as in a library or school) we recommend logging out at the end of each session.  
<br><br>


        If you refuse to accept our cookies, we will not be able to offer you the ability to customize our TV or Radio Schedule, our Around Town Calendar, or other WGBH Online features to suit your specific preferences. If you have not chosen to customize, our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information about you.
<br><br>


       When visiting any Web site, your browser sends information to the site's hosting server identifying the browser you're using, your Internet service provider (ISP), the page you last visited, and the page you're currently visiting. Your browser does not, however, send any personally identifying information to Web sites unless you explicitly provide that information in a form. Thus, WGBH Online cannot extract any personally identifying information about you from what we receive via your browser. 
<br><br>
<br><br>

Please check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of WGBH Online following the posting of any changes to these terms shall mean that you have accepted those changes.
