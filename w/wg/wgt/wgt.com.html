<p class="termsSectionHeader">Cookies</p>

<p class="termsSectionHeader">Disclosure and Opt-In</p>

<p class="termsSection">If you enter and/or have won a contest offered by us through the Site, we will collect your first and last name, mailing address, shipping address, tax identification number, date of birth, identity verification and, where applicable, your credit card or payment information, if we collect a fee from you.  We will use such information to complete prize fulfillment and to comply with any applicable tax regulations and/or any obligations we have in connection with contests or services that we provide jointly with third parties.</p>

<p class="termsSection">If you are a contest winner, we may provide your name to other users of our Site if they request a list of winners of a contest.  We may also disclose your personally identifiable information to our third party service providers that assist us in providing services to you (such as our third party co-location provider, contest administrator, or payment processor).

<p class="termsSection">We may offer contests or provide services jointly with  third parties on the Site. You can tell when another company is involved in any contest or service provided on the Site, and, unless otherwise specified herein, only if you have expressly agreed to allow us to provide your personally identifiable information to our contest sponsors by clicking on the "Opt-In" button and opting-in, we may share your personally identifiable information for their marketing use. If you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information to such third party contest sponsors by not opting-in and not providing any information.  Their use of your personally identifiable information will be subject to their privacy policies and terms of use and they may contact you with marketing messages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you register to participate in a challenge or tournament on the Site that is a benefit for a charity and you pay an entry fee and/or make a donation to that charity, you acknowledge and agree that we will provide all personally identifiable information you submit during registration to the charity so that they may communicate with you regarding the tax deductibility of any donation you make and generally about the activities of the charity.  We will also share, or give permission to any such charity to share, your personally identifiable information with other sponsors of the challenge or tournament for purposes of prize fulfillment.  Those communications will be subject to the privacy policy of the relevant charity.  Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third parties to whom we provide your personally identifiable information and as such, WGT cannot guarantee that such third parties adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as World Golf Tour (WGT).</p>
