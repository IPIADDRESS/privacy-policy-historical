		<b>Last Updated: May, 2006 </b> 
		<p>WGNAMERICA.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology 
		and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally 
		Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone 
		number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. Please note this policy 
		applies only to information collected by WGNAMERICA.com online and does not impact 
		information collected or used by WGNAMERICA.com or its affiliates through other means. 
		</p>
		<p><b>How we gather information from users.</b></p>

		<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, 
		the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. 
		You can visit many pages on our site without providing any information. Other 
		pages may prompt you to provide information, such as when you register for access 
		to portions of our site, sign up for membership, request certain features (e.g., 
		newsletters, news updates and other products), sign up for a newspaper subscription 
		or make a purchase. You may also provide information when you participate in 
		sweepstakes and contests, voting and polling activities, message boards and 
		chat rooms and other interactive areas of our site.<br>

		<br>
		Like most Web sites, WGNAMERICA.com also collects information automatically and through 
		the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, 
		we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use "cookie" 
		technology. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, 
		sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or 
		may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while 
		visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information 
		through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with 
		information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, 
		but doing so may limit your ability to access certain portions of the site or 
		may require you to re-enter your user name and password. Additionally we may 
		not be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences.</p>
		<p><b>What we do with the information we collect.</b></p>
		<p>We will use your information only as permitted by law. Aggregated Information 
		(information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. 
		As one example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar 
		information obtained from other users to learn which pages are visited most 
		or what features are most attractive. Aggregated Information may occasionally 
		be shared with our advertisers and business partners, but cannot be used to 
		contact you individually.</p>

		<p>We also collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized 
		content and advertising. For example, we may use Personally Identifiable Information 
		collected on WGNAMERICA.com to communicate with you regarding our <a href="termsofservice.html">Terms 
		of Service</a> and privacy policy, products and services offered by WGNAMERICA.com 
		and other Tribune Company affiliates and partners, administration of sweepstakes 
		and contests, processing e-commerce transactions and other topics we think you 
		might find of interest. We reserve the right to share this information with 
		other Tribune Company business units and affiliates, including for example our 
		affiliated newspapers and entities in which Tribune Company has an ownership 
		interest (collectively, "Affiliates"). This policy does not apply 
		to any Affiliate's use of such information.</p>

		<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by WGNAMERICA.com may also be used 
		for other purposes including but not limited to site administration and troubleshooting. 
		Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our 
		site (our Web hosting service and our newsletter provider, for example) may 
		access such information.</p>
		<p>As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner 
		with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may 
		be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response 
		to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required 
		to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to 
		us, and/or whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary to give such information 
		to law enforcement authorities. Please note we may not provide you with notice 
		prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
		<p><b>Your choice to opt out.</b></p>

		<p>The quality news and information on WGNAMERICA.com is supported by advertising revenue 
		and a controlled program of e-mail marketing is an important element of our 
		online publishing business. Like other Web publishers, we sometimes permit our 
		advertising and promotional partners to e-mail you about services, features, 
		products, special offers and unique content we believe might interest you. If 
		you prefer not to receive e-mail communications sent directly from our advertisers 
		or promotional partners, you will be given an opportunity to decline before 
		you provide us information we might use for this purpose. If you decline at 
		the time you provide us such information, we will not share the Personally Identifiable 
		Information you provide with non-Affiliated advertisers for such purposes, though 
		we may on occasion send you information on their behalf. </p>
		<p><b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements.</b></p>
		<p>WGNAMERICA.com expects its partners, advertisers and third-party affiliates to respect 
		the privacy of our users. However, third parties, including our partners, advertisers, 
		affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have 
		their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during 
		your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a WGNAMERICA.com 
		page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, 
		through WGNAMERICA.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, 
		Web sites, advertisements, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other 
		parties. WGNAMERICA.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third 
		parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties 
		when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
		<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties 
		may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences 
		or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served 
		by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine 
		whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Through features available 
		on our site, third parties may use cookies or other technology to gather information. 
		WGNAMERICA.com does not control the use of this technology or the resulting information 
		and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
		<p>A cookie gets entered by your Web browser into the "Cookies" folder on your hard drive after you close your browser, and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. We use persistent and session cookies to analyze and enhance your experience on the Site, and use third party ad technology to serve ads. The data that is collected is the property of WGNAMERICA.com, not the third party. We also allow third parties called ad networks or ad servers to serve ads to you on WGNAMERICA.com. Cookies enable them to compile information about where you, or others who have used your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information makes it possible for the ad technology, ad servers and ad networks to deliver targeted advertisements to you on WGNAMERICA.com. WGNAMERICA.com does not have access to the cookies that may be placed on your computer by third-party ad technology, ad servers or ad networks. WGNAMERICA.com maintains relationships with a number of third-party networks, including Doubleclick, Unicast, and Pointroll. Those parties that use cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting. You may find more information at the Web site of the individual ad network or the 
		<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp"> Network Advertising Initiative.</a></p>

		<p>Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. Should you choose 
		to voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on our site, such 
		as in message boards, chat areas or in advertising or notices you post, that 
		information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties 
		without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals 
		or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of WGNAMERICA.com and this 
		policy.</p>
		<p><b>Children.</b></p>
		<p>WGNAMERICA.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information 
		from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we 
		have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, 
		we will delete that information immediately. If you believe WGNAMERICA.com has any 
		information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address 
		listed below.</p>
		<p><b>Contacting us.</b></p>

		<p> <b>Changes to this policy.</b></p>

		<p>WGNAMERICA.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check 
		this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following 
		the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. Information 
		collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the 
		rules and laws that applied at the time the information was collected.</p>
		<p><b>Governing law.</b></p>
		<p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Illinois law. Any claim 
		related to the Site or this policy shall be brought in a federal or state court 
		in Chicago, Illinois, within one year after the claim arises. You agree no such 
		claim may be brought as a class action. Users of WGNAMERICA.com consent to the jurisdiction 
		and venue of such court as the most convenient and appropriate for the resolution 
		of disputes concerning this policy. WGNAMERICA.com is controlled, operated and administered 
		entirely within the United States. If you are located outside the United States, 
		please note the information you provide to us will be transferred to the United 
		States. You hereby consent to this transfer. </p>
		<p>In the event case of any conflict between the terms of this policy and the 
		terms of any electronic or machine readable privacy policy (for example, a P3P 
		electronic privacy policy), the terms of this written policy shall control.
