            the privacy and security of the users of our sites. <br>
            <br>
            This privacy policy will advise you about how we protect your personal
            information, and about what choices you have concerning our use of
            such information. Please read this policy carefully. We may need
            to change this policy from time to time in order to address new issues
            and reflect changes on our sites. We will post those changes here
            so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might
            use that information, and whether we will disclose that information
            to anyone. Please refer back to this policy regularly. <br>

            <strong>Personal Identification Information </strong>
            <br>
            From time to time we may disclose personal identification information
            about you as an individual user (such as, for example, your full
            name, street address, telephone number or e-mail address) to one
            or more third parties. We may request personal identification information
            from you in connection with your use of, or participation in, (i)
            contests, sweepstakes, games or surveys, (ii) becoming a member of
            WTTW or WFMT or pledging financial support, (iii) community postings
            such as forums, discussion groups or bulletin boards, (iv) requests
            for additional information in connection with other activities, services
            or resources we make available on our site and (v) e-mail transactions.
            In all of these cases, we will collect personal identification information
            from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us. <br>
            <br>
            If you do provide us with personal information, we may use it to
            conduct the activities described above. If you identify yourself
            to us by sending us an e- mail with questions or comments, we may
            use your personal information to respond to your questions or comments.
            We may file your comments for future reference, or we may discard
            the information after we have reviewed it. <br>
            <br>
            If you give us your permission, we may also use personal identification
            information for internal marketing and promotional purposes, or on
            occasion, when mailing lists are made available to other organizations.
            If at any time you would like WWCI to discontinue using this information,

            Protecting your privacy and your information is a top priority. We
            have taken careful measures to secure both your information and our
            physical premises. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission
            of your information from your PC to our servers. Our secure server
            software encrypts information, ensuring that all Internet transactions
            remain private (unless sent by an unsecured means, such as e-mail).
            Neither WWCI, any telephone network nor service providers are responsible
            for incorrect or inaccurate transcription of information or for any

            or on- line service or any other error or malfunction or misdirected
            entries. Last sentence deleted. Non-Personal Identification Information
            And The Use Of Cookie Technology We collect non-personal identification
            information through the use of "cookie" technology and/or IP address
            tracking. Non-personal identification information might include the
            browser you use, the type of computer, the operating systems, the
            Internet service providers and other similar information. Our system
            also automatically gathers information about the areas you visit
            on our sites and about the links you may select from within our site
            to other areas of the World Wide Web or elsewhere online. We use
            such information in the aggregate to understand how our users as
            a group use the services and resources provided on our sites. This
            way we know which areas of our sites are favorites of our users,
            which areas need improvement, and what technologies are being used
            so that we may continually improve our sites. <br>
