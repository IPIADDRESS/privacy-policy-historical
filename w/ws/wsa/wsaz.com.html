GTGI PRIVACY POLICY and YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
This Privacy Policy does not cover the “Ask the Experts” advertising feature or “My Capture” service for user generated content that may be offered on this web channel.  Please see the separate privacy policies for Ask the Experts and My Capture. <br><br>

At Gray Television Group, Inc.

For a list of those web channels, <b><a href="http://media.graytvinc.com/video/GrayTelevision_InteractiveMap05.swf" target="_blank">Click Here.</a></b>   This Privacy Policy governs the collection of any Personal Information you provide to a GTGI web channel that is part of the GTGI Network and does not cover any such information collected by its corporate parent, affiliates, or any other company, unless specifically stated. This Privacy Policy is also incorporated into the GTGI Legal Terms for Web Channel Usage Agreement (“Terms of Use”) by reference. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the same meaning as defined in the Terms of Use.  <br><br>

Unless specified otherwise on the Service, all users must be at least 18 years of age and a legal resident of the United States to participate in any activity that requires the submission of Personal Information.  This Service is designed and targeted to United States (“U.S.”) audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S.  We make no representation that this Service is operated in accordance with the laws or governed by other nations.  By your participation in our Service activities, you certify that you are at least 18 years of age and located in the U.S.  If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the U.S. and you participate in activities on this Service contrary to our policy that only U.S. residents are eligible for certain activities, you do so at your own risk and initiative, and are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws.  Please be aware that any Personal Information you voluntarily submit to us will be transferred to the U.S and subject to U.S. law.  By using this Service, participating in any Service activities, and/or providing us with your Personal Information, you consent to this collection, transfer and use of Personal Information to the U.S., and waive any claims that may arise under your own national laws.  
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time without notice to you, so please check back often. Certain revisions are effective to you as a user of this web channel immediately upon posting. When we revise the Privacy Policy, we will post a notice on the web channel’s home page.  For revisions that are classified as significant changes in the use and disclosure of your information we will also send a notice to your email address currently on file with GTGI, and meet any other requirement under applicable law.

What are “Your California Privacy Rights”?
Under California law, California residents who have an established business relationship with us will have the right to receive information about our opt-out policy of sharing your Personal Information with GTGI corporate affiliated companies (collectively, “GTGI Affiliates”) and with non-affiliated third parties, including Advertisers, for marketing purposes. If you wish to learn about our opt-out policies and your rights under California law, please send your written request to us using the email or postal mail address below.  In an email request, you must state “Re: Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject line.  


<br><br>


Gray Television Group, Inc.
Attn: Lisa Bishop/Your California Privacy Rights

<br><br>

For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state and zip code. We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. We are not responsible for responding to requests that are not labeled or not sent properly, or do not have complete information.
Your request to opt-out of our future sharing of your Personal Information with either GTGI Affiliates or third parties will be processed within ten (10) business days of the date it is received in accordance with the information below. Please note that non-affiliated third parties are independent from GTGI and if you wish to stop all communications from such third parties, you will need to address your request to the non-affiliated third parties directly.

<br><br>

1.	Collection of Personal Information
You do not need to provide any Personal Information (which is information that can identify you or can be used to contact you) to use a GTGI web channel or to obtain information from most of the features and activities of a GTGI web channel. In general, you can visit our web channels without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information.
However, if you want to participate in certain online services, you may be asked to provide some Personal Information, such as your name, mailing address, business address, telephone, mobile phone, birth date or age, and/or e-mail address.  You might be asked to choose a user name and password, and provide that information when accessing certain online features or services. If you do not want to give us any Personal Information, you can always choose not to participate.  The choice is yours. We are only interested in offering you convenient online services that match your interests and needs.
Unless stated otherwise, we do not purposefully request contact information for a mobile phone, text messaging or any wireless device that includes a domain name address (such as “.net” or “.com”) as part of the contact information. Federal law prohibits the sending of commercial email messages directly to a wireless device that uses a domain name, unless you have first given your affirmative consent. We may inadvertently collect a wireless device number that includes a domain name when you send us an inquiry or register for a contest or membership club. However, we will not knowingly use that contact information for sending commercial email.  We reserve the right to respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless device that uses a domain name as such messages are not deemed to be commercial email and therefore, are not regulated by Federal law.  However, when “computer to phone” commercial emails are prohibited by law, we may reject your wireless device contact information when such information is submitted for certain features or services.  We will attempt to notify you if we will need new contact information.  All users of the Service are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal Information when prompted and we will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false or fraudulent. Any prize or benefit shall be forfeited due to a rejected or disqualified entry.  
Your continued participation indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information as described below.   We may from time to time, transfer or merge any Personal Information collected off-line to our online databases or store off-line information in an electronic format. We may also combine Personal Information we collect online with information available from other sources, including information received from Advertisers, or marketing companies.  This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Service or a participant in Station activities.  
The list below contains some of the instances when a GTGI web channel, one of its operational service providers or vendors (third party companies that provide internal support to the Service) may collect your Personal Information. Please note that many of our web channels may offer additional online features and services and may ask you to provide some Personal Information before permitting you to access those areas. 

<br><br>


Automated News Services and Updates.  This Service may offer you special subscription features for news and news-related topics: 1) “E-News,” “E-Sports,” or “E-Weather” provides news, sports, and weather updates, respectively, via email; and 2) the “First Alert” feature provides weather information at your desktop.  For the email updates, you are only required to submit an email address.  To subscribe to the First Alert feature, you are required to provide your first and last name, zip code, email address, location of the email address, gender, and birth date.  The submission of other information such as your computer’s operating system, ranges for household income and education, and a general description of your profession is voluntary.

<br><br>


Polls. Many GTGI web channels offer polling areas, which provide users with an opportunity to vote on local and national issues of concern. When you choose to participate in a poll, we may ask you to provide your name, gender, age or birth date, zip code and/or e-mail address. This information helps us to ensure the accuracy of our polling data.

<br><br>


Surveys. GTGI web channels also may allow users to complete surveys about products or services offered by GTGI or other companies. These surveys may ask for your name and e-mail address, and/or other information, such as your gender, age or birth date and income level. This information helps us to understand our survey results.

<br><br>


Contests/Trivia. GTGI web channels also afford users many opportunities to play contests or trivia games. When you enter into a contest, trivia game or any other promotional opportunity, we may ask for your name, password information, and telephone number and address (physical and electronic) so that we can contact you if you win. Sometimes we may require you to provide additional information, such as your birth date, gender and income level. Of course, if you do not want to provide such information, you do not need to participate in the online activity.

<br><br>


Purchases &amp; Shopping. Some GTGI web channels enable users to purchase products. When you purchase products, we may request your name, billing and/or shipping address, email address, telephone number and credit card information. This information allows us to send you the items you ordered, to process payment information, and to respond to product and billing questions.  Credit card or debit card account information will be collected via a secured transmission process and will be stored in a commercially reasonable secured manner.  Alternatively, the Service may use a third party operational service provider to conduct the financial transaction in a secured manner; the third party payment website will be accessible via a hyperlink from the GTGI Network Station’s web channel and will be solely responsible for all financial transactions and the collection, use, storage and disposal of your Personal Information.

<br><br>


Chat/Message Boards/Blogs. GTGI web channels also may offer users the chance to participate in public areas, such as chat rooms, message boards, blogs and/or news groups. When you choose to participate in any of these areas, we may request your name, password information and address (physical and electronic). This information helps us respond to questions or concerns about use of these public areas.  We reserve the right to edit or delete any Personal Information disclosed to the public.

<br><br>


Comments/Questions.  We afford users an opportunity to submit comments or questions online. You must provide, at minimum, your name to submit a comment or question, in some instances email address is optional.  If you choose to provide other Personal Information with, or in your comment or question, we may retain such information in our public correspondence files unless you are identified as a person less than 13 years of age. General correspondence received from children identified as being less than 13 years of age will be deleted and destroyed consistent with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”).  However, GTGI Stations are obligated by the Federal Communications Commission to maintain certain public correspondence related to the operations of the Station in its public inspection file, which may also be available via a Station’s web channel.  Such correspondence will be maintained in the GTGI network Stations’ public inspection file and made available for review by the general public as required by the FCC, even such correspondence knowingly received from children. 

<br><br>


2.	Use and Disclosure of Personal Information 
GTGI web channels use your Personal Information for three general purposes. First, we use the information to provide you with the services you request and to respond to billing and/or other questions related to such service offerings. Second, we use the information to understand your use of our web channels and to notify you about updates to one of our web channels or to send you marketing materials or promotional offers from the Service, GTGI Network Stations, or on behalf of our advertisers, sponsors, and promotional partners (collectively, “Advertisers”)  that may be of interest to you. Third, we may use this information in aggregate form to help us evaluate and modify existing services, and to help us develop additional services that are likely to be of interest to our users. 

<br><br>


We reserve the right to collect Personal Information using any new technology yet to be developed and to use such technology to provide new services and features to you, as well as for marketing and promotional purposes.  Specific information regarding your choice to Opt-out to such use, or for sharing your Personal Information with Advertisers, will be provided once the new technology, service, or feature is introduced. 

<br><br>


On occasion, GTGI or one of its Network Stations may share your Personal Information with our Advertisers. You will have an opportunity to “Opt-out” of such sharing at the time of registration for the event or feature or by contacting the Service at [LISA – INSERT PROPER EMAIL ADDRESS FOR A PERSON TO OPT-OUT].  

<br><br>


We also provide you with an option to “Opt-out” of receiving advertising and promotional email from us about GTGI, its Stations or our Advertisers in compliance with federal law by installing an Opt-out mechanism with all such commercial email messages. You must use the designated method in the email message to notify us of your Opt-out request, as we cannot guarantee that other methods of notification will be effective or timely.  Please be aware that we may continue to contact you via email for administrative, transactional or informational purposes, including follow-up messages regarding contests you have entered or other transactions you have undertaken.  By law, such messages are not considered to be commercial email.

<br><br>


We are not responsible for removing your Personal Information from third party lists or entities which you have previously authorized us to share your information.  You will need to contact those entities directly. 
We may also share aggregate Personal Information and non-Personal Information about website usage with unaffiliated third parties, including, but not limited to, government agencies, Advertisers, and the media (i.e., __% of GTGI users are female, __% of users have visited certain sections, etc.). This aggregate information does not contain any Personal Information about a specific individual. 

<br><br>


We may share your Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties in limited instances. For example, we may share your Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties as is necessary to process or collect payments, or service registered-user accounts. We also may hire third party technology providers to host the GTGI Network and to store your Personal Information. 

<br><br>


In the event that the assets or stock of the Service, GTGI, its Network Stations, and GTGI’s parent company are sold or transferred, merged with a different company or entity, restructured, or subject to other fundamental corporate changes, we reserve the right to disclose any and all databases compiled from Personal Information.  We will seek to obligate the company’s successor to agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy, as it may hereafter be modified, but cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so or that the successor company will comply with this obligation.  

<br><br>


Finally, we may be required to disclose Personal Information by law or legal process, to protect and defend the rights or property of a GTGI web channel, to respond to or participate in a governmental inquiry or investigation, or to protect the personal safety of users of our web channels. We also reserve the right to contact appropriate authorities when activities that are illegal (or reasonably presumed to be illegal) or violate our policies is taking place on a GTGI web channel. 
Except under the limited circumstances described above, we will not disclose any of your Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties.

<br><br>


3.	How We Protect Personal Information
We take reasonable measures to protect the privacy, accuracy, and reliability of any information you choose to provide and to protect such information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Only authorized employees are permitted to access Personal Information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions. Any employee who violates our privacy access policies will be subject to disciplinary action. 

<br><br>


However, please note that this Service does not use a secured connection for the transmission of Personal Information except for the purchase of goods and services. When a user transmits Personal Information over an unsecured Internet connection, Personal Information during the transmission such as your email or registration could be copied or intercepted by unknown third parties.  Therefore, you understand, acknowledge and agree that you transmit certain Personal Information over this Service at your own risk.  

<br><br>


4.	Accessing or Deleting Your Personal information
If you have submitted Personal Information through a GTGI web channel and you would like to access that information, please send an e-mail to rstora@gcslink.com. We will use reasonable efforts to supply you with this information and to correct any factual inaccuracies that you identify. Upon your request, we also will remove your Personal Information from our active databases. Given the limitations of our computer systems, corporate business policies, and federal or state laws, we may not be able to delete all of your Personal Information. We reserve the right to deny access to any user if we believe there is a question about his/her identity. And if the burden or expense of providing access to a user’s Personal Information is disproportionate to the potential privacy risks to that user, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may chose to not provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide you with an explanation and a contact person for further inquiries. 

<br><br>


5.	Collection, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personal Information 
GTGI web channel may collect and freely disclose information about you that is not personally identifiable, as described in the next two sections below.  We reserve the right to merge any such information with your Personal Information but will do so only in accordance with GTGI guidelines and applicable law.

<br><br>


6.	Internet Protocol Addresses 
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. This number by itself does not identify your name, e-mail address or other Personal Information. If you request pages from any GTGI web channel, that web channel's server will enter your IP address into a log. To maintain user anonymity, GTGI does not associate or link IP addresses with records containing Personal Information unless it is necessary to enforce the law, our Terms of Use, protect GTGI, its users, employees, operational service providers or Advertisers, or to defend against or investigate any charges or claims against GTGI. We also do not permit IP addresses to be associated and viewed with posts to chat rooms, blogs and bulletin boards by other users. We store IP addresses for a period of time to help us to identify anyone who refuses to comply with our Terms of Service, applicable law, and to identify visitors who threaten our Service, web channel, customers or others. We also will use this information to measure web channel traffic for purposes of system administration and for our Advertisers. This aggregate data also helps us to understand how people are using the web channel and helps us improve your online experience. 

<br><br>


7.	Passive Collection of User Information via Cookies and Web Beacons 
GTGI web channels passively collect certain kinds of non-Personal information automatically through the use of "cookies."  "Cookies" are small text files that recognize repeat visitors, facilitate ongoing access and personalization to some of our features and activities and other websites, and will allow us to understand how and when pages are visited and by how many people. Cookies can store a variety of information, including IP addresses, navigational data, server information, data transfer times, user preferences, shopping cart information and passwords needed to access our web channels and Service.  We use cookies to make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not. We may also use cookies to serve customized advertising or content to you based on your geographic location, age, gender, or other demographics that you have provided to us and to ensure the accuracy of our polling data. You may configure your browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent.  If you do not want to allow our cookies on your computer, you must configure your browser to turn off all cookies used by GTGI, our system does not allow you to opt-out to them individually.  However, if you do so, you might not be able to access important functions or enjoy certain conveniences or customized features of our Service.   
A web beacon (also called a web bug, pixel tag or a clear GIF) is typically a small transparent graphic image that is placed on a web page or in an email and is used to monitor the activity of the user visiting the webpage or email. Web beacons are used for website traffic reporting, auditing and reporting user clicks on an ad, and tracking the number of unique visitors to a webpage or ad. Web beacons and cookies may also be used in combination to customize your experience on this web channel by monitoring your activity and interests. 

<br><br>


Our Advertisers and third party network advertising servers, such as Google, will also place cookies and/or web beacons on your computer to personalize your experience on this web channel. Cookies and web beacons are standard in the Internet advertising industry. Google will use the DART Double Click Cookie to use non-Personal Information about your visits to and activities on this web channel and other websites within the ad serving network in order to provide advertisements and promotions about goods and services of interest to you.  Such non-Personal Information includes your IP Address, search activity, website viewing history, purchase and transaction history, and/or advertising views.  This information is not merged, linked or associated with your Personal Information, such as an email address.  Please note that GTGI does not control Advertiser cookies or web beacons, and such technology is not subject to this Privacy Policy. Please see Google’s “Privacy Policy for Google Ads and the Google Content Network” for more information about this form of personalized advertising and learn about your opt-out choices.  <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_cookies.html">http://www.google.com/privacy_cookies.html</a>  

<br><br>


Please be aware that opting out of a network advertising server does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns. Additionally, the Google Opt-out Tool is cookie-based. In order for the Tool to work on your computer, your browser must be set to accept third party cookies. If you buy a new computer, change web browsers or delete this cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out task again. 

<br><br>


8.	Safeguarding Children's Privacy 
GTGI web channels will not knowingly collect Personal Information or any other identifying data from children under 13 years of age without first obtaining verifiable consent from a parent or legal guardian. Requests for parental consent will explain how we collect, use, and disclose children's Personal Information, and will include an opportunity for parents to prevent use of their children's Personal Information, as well as to prevent their children from participating in features which involve the collection of Personal Information. In addition, if/when we request Personal Information from children less than 13 years of age with verifiable parental consent, we will not require the child to disclose more Personal Information than is necessary in order to participate in any online feature or service. 

<br><br>


Should a child whom we know to be under 13 submit Personal Information to a GTGI web channel without first obtaining verifiable parental consent, we will immediately reject any such entry and delete that information from our database, unless such information meets an exception under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act or pertains to the programming or operations of GTGI Network Stations and therefore, will be subject to the regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  We are required by the FCC to post any such emailed comments on this web channel. (See above Comments/Question Section.)

<br><br>


Except to meet FCC, other regulatory and legal purposes, we will not use, distribute or disclose any child's Personal Information to third parties without prior parental consent. Unless we are required to retain any Personal Information for regulatory, tax or other legal purposes we will promptly remove such information from our database if a parent withdraws his or her consent to our use or maintenance of Personal Information collected from his or her child.

<br><br>


9.	External Links 
GTGI web channels may provide links to various external websites or services (collectively referred to as a “Linked Website”). (Please see the Service’s Legal Terms for Web Channel Use Agreement for more information.) When you click on one of these links, you will be transferred from a GTGI web channel and connected to the service or website of the third party organization or company that you selected. Even if an affiliation exists between GTGI and a third party Linked Website, you understand, acknowledge and agree that GTGI exercises no control and has no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or business practices of a Linked Website. Each of these Linked Websites (such as “Ask the Experts” and “My Capture”) maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures. If you visit a website that is linked to a GTGI web channel, you should consult that website's privacy policy before providing those websites with any of your Personal Information. 

<br><br>


10.	Framed Websites/Pages
The Service may also include certain pages that are “framed” and link to third party websites (“Framed Pages”). We provide these Framed Pages as a convenience to our users. A Framed Page may have the same look and feel as other pages on the Service, with a GTGI or Network Station logo and border, but Framed Pages are often merely gateways to other websites.  Even if an affiliation exists between GTGI and a Framed Page, you understand, acknowledge and agree that GTGI exercises no control over Framed Pages, and GTGI is not responsible for any content or the privacy policies or data-collection practices of a Framed Page. The privacy policy of the Framed Page, if any, will control your use of, and provision of information to or through, the Framed Page. If you visit a Framed Page, you should consult the Framed Page’s privacy policy before providing any Personal Information.  

<br><br>


11.	Terms, Changes and Questions 
By using a GTGI web channel, you signify your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the web channel or disclose any Personal Information.   
If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on the web channel’s home page. We will also notify you of significant changes via email (if we have your current email address).  If you do not agree to the changes in the Privacy Policy, you understand, acknowledge and agree that your only recourse is to stop using our Service, and your continued use of our Service constitutes acceptance of such changes in the Privacy Policy, except where further steps are required by applicable law. The effective date of this Privacy Policy is noted in the beginning of this Privacy Policy.

<li><span class="title">Posted By: Jane Doe</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Thanks Deane! That's exactly what I've been trying to say. Thanks for the kind words. May someone see your message and open up their minds a little to let God in!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: To Big Earl</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">You're losing! Ha,Ha
And to coalminerbychoice...I bet those hippies are smart enough to spell by (buy) correctly!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Sophie</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">I would like to yell about the on ramps of I-64 at Dunbar going east to Chas. &amp; the on ramp at So. Chas. heading west. There are quite a few wrecks at the Dunbar on-ramp because it is a short ramp and cars headed east don't move over &amp; make room for their entrance. Nearly every morning, it bottlenecks there and in the evening the same on the other side of the bridge where cars entering on the So. Chas side slow down the traffic. At the end of that ramp, there is no where to go. Either someone lets you in, or you've got to stop (wrong move on a ramp!). A warning "Merging Traffic Ahead" should be posted. The new bridge won't have a thing to do with eliminating this problem. The ramps are dangerously short and when congested, there is no where to go. They should have built a third lane that would have an eventual merge not a "wham bam here I am" kind of ramp. We cannot skimp on safety.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Gertrude</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">I try to stay away from Doctors and hospitals so other people won't have to pay for my care since all I have is Medicare. I can't afford other ins. and I am not able to work. If hospitals  wouldn't gouge their prices health care wouldn't be so much. It pays to ask for an itemized bill and ask questions. Is $20 for 2 Advil too much? Yes it costs to make the drugs we are given but they charge outrageous  prices. If the gov. wants to run things why don't they put the skids on hospitals and drug companies gouging prices. I am all for everyone having equal healthcare and the government wastes enough to help pay for it but not to dictate when and where we get treatment. I know of one city where you have to pay the doctor extra and make an appointment before he or she will visit you at the hospital. Is this reasonable? What's more important,the money or his or her patients? Progress now is to talk to drs through robots and not at your bedside. Will we billed extra?
Probably.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: amber</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">to: social health care: My husband works a decent job, he earns 28,000 a year, I earn around 20,000 a year, but we still do not have healthcare because we simply cannot afford it from his company. Mine does not even offer it. To get it for the entire family would cost around 800 dollars a month...maybe not bad, but once we pay that, we won't have enough money to pay the deductible and the copay, plus our other bills. We DO NOT have a big cable or television package, we have an antenna to get the locals. The only luxury we have is the internet and cell phonese, and that is because of our children and elderly parents needing to get ahold of us when we are not at home. Our jobs pay our bills, but heaven help us if we get sick. We were not lucky enough to land a job that pays extra well so we could get health insurance. Not everyone was, have some compassion for the unlucky ones.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: </span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Then tell me why....in thousands of years. NOTHING has taken place ever again supposedly like God/Jesus! MISCONCEPTION of writings. Because it was a LIE! And please don't say.."He will, in time." History repeats itself (destruction-we are ruining this life as we no it-global warming)...Bible is just a book! (Actually a good History book!) How eastern civilizations started. Nothing more, nothing less! People have made so much money off that book--gotten rich (look at all the fake spiritual leaders also). Wow; what a FANTASTIC Marketing Concept! There is no heaven or hell. We live our HELL on earth. GOD is NOT GOING to save YOU!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: </span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">"get a job that has benefits" WHERE are those jobs? MANY companies are doing away with their health care BECAUSE of the costs. Have you seen the many commercials now advertised on TV about health ins. Look at those prices! Who can afford $500.00 dollars a month just for health care. Then what about the people who work for major companies (rest., retail) will not give you health unless you are full-time. But they called their part-time (36 hrs). Believe it or not; in this state you can only receive the medical care if you are disabled. We need to have an over-haul of medicine (doctors, hospitals, etc.) WHY DOES IT COST $10.00 a pill (and that pills is an aspirin?)</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: </span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Posted by: Baptist Preacher on Jun 15, 2009 at 05:21 PM. Then that makes the Bible a History book (written by people) and not written by God. That means IT IS NOT HOLY!  There is no hell. WE live it here!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: bogus numbers</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">the numbers given out previously was about 35 million americans.well guess what informed news media,not obama media are informing american that number is a big percentage of illegals gettin free health care.so they,ve changed their words to 35million people.kinda like the gore global warming words have changed to climate change when the info.got out that its colder,that is till july and aug.then they,ll revert back to global warming.but who am i to question gore,remember he created the internet.only people who dont pay taxes and live off the fat of the land believe in more and bigger gov.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Denise</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Has anyone had painting done on the interior of their home recently?  Did they do an excellet job?  Were they reasonably priced?  If so, please let me know who they were so I can give them a call.  THANK YOU!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: RoaneCo.</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Healthcare, to answer your question "when did we become such a greedy nation?" I believe it was 1854.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Big Earl</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Hello good working people of WV this is Big Earl and have you people ever noticed how these grocery stores are tying to make nice with the hippies in there stores? Now used to be you could go to the market and get 50 pds of potatoes, lard, beans, flour, you know all the makings of a good meal. Now when you walk through the door they have these tree hugger black bags made out of recycled leaves and twigs from China where they have green slop bigger than the Blob running through the streets. Next I saw something that will no doubt make the PETA types happy “cage free chicken eggs.” Now that is what you get when you try and let a PETA type run a egg farm they don’t have any sense anyway and anybody that’s ever been around a chicken knows it needs a cage or a good wire pen. These hippies probably loose more eggs to foxes cause Henrietta hen is laying all over the place instead of in a nice box of straw like God intended. And all this so called “organic” stuff like milk juice and vegetables people you know what that means all they do is dump it full of cow manure instead of nice clean fertilizer pellets from the Bayer asprin plant and let the bugs crawl all over it. Sounds delicious don’t it.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: oh and another thing</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">do you notice when someone thinks socialized medicine is a good thing,and theydont understand why ;YOU PEOPLE;dont,wont support one more gov.failure,they always say YOU are already paying,,,,,NOT me,myself,i,are already paying,,,,living off the fat of the land language,,,,,your,our money is never enough,,,look at 3;54 a.m.comment about how selfish YOU PEOPLE are.a greedy nation,,I THINK NOT,,,,</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Keith</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Good point Gandalf, in a word horrible. I cannot imagine a worse candidate the Rs could have put up than McCain, he was O lite. I remember hearing how McCain was going to tax health benefits as income, and how bad that was. Now to pay for this monstrosity O is going to hit working people, via his stooges in the Senate, with the same tax. Working people are getting hammered by this guy. I think the person who compared ruining the health care system to the ruined education system made a great point. We are last across the board in most everything, and I don't blame the individual teacher, but the bureaucracy that runs education. If that is the most successful thing you can cite that the govt. runs, do you REALLY want them to run medical care? Dear Lord, help us please. My premiums are high due to a lawsuit happy culture and unnecessary tests performed out of fear by doctors, but most of all due to bad choices and unhealthy living by deadbeats who could care less that I have to support.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: facts about</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">the so called uninsured.people can go to the emergency room and not be turned away,taxpayers fund local health depts.medicade,medicare, veterans health care,screenings in public places like buisness,parks,the list goes on and on.there seems to be enough around if people would get off their rear ends and take control of their own destiny instead of wanting;YOU PEOPLE;as the fat of the landers call productive workers to be forced to pay more and more,it seems to never end or be enough.sell your big screen t.v.unhook your expensive cable.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: healthcare</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">i don't understand arguing against nationalized health care....quick points....you are already paying for people who don't have ins., its why your premiums are so high....pharmacuetical companies spend more in advertising than research....there are millions of people in the US without healthcare so the argument "get a job that has benefits" isn't really valid (its like saying if you want a job making 60k a year just go get one)....we have nationalized education, maybe we should privatize it was well to save a few bucks...if you can't afford it then sorry about your luck right??  it saddens me that we are a nation of people who couldn't care less if someone lives or dies if it saves them a few bucks in taxes....when did we become such a greedy nation???</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: not a fan of Charleston..</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">I am totally amazed by the amount of crime that occurs in Charleston each day. I cannot imagine living in a city where your neighbors are being killed, raped, robbed, etc. The small town is my choice over big cities anyday. Coming to my town after leaving Charleston is like stepping back in time 20 or 30 years. We may not have shopping, nightlife, etc that big cities have, but at least children can play outside without worrying about being shot, and elderly people can sit on their porch without being killed.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Gandalf</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">@ Keith; How do you think McCain would be doing in the White House about now? 4 more years of the same old sameold? Or would he have started carpet bombing Hanoi again? Look at Iran today... Young intelligent people are about to be massacred, if not already. The old school fundamentalism cannot bring about anything but death and destruction. It is the human genetic defect.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: social health care</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">its my understanding ,there are over a thousand health insurance providers.if the co.a person works for doesnt provide coverage,get a job that does.but other taxpayers shouldnt have to provide other peoples insurance.maybe that person doesnt neccerally like  the job they go to every day but does the right thing for his,her family.how big a t.v. or cable package do  people have that have no health insurance?just curious.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Deane</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">God's word says to love our neighbors as we love ourselves and also do unto others as you would have them to do unto you. You don't believe in God's word and that it is a fable? Have you really read or studied it or do you take other people's word for what it says? Don't take my word for it but read and study it with an open  mind, yourself. Scientists have been trying to disprove it for centuries but the more they try the more they prove it to be true. Yes the God inspired men that wrote the Bible wrote it for the times they lived in but it still holds true for today and the way we live. Their are two choices we have in this life and it is to live and strive for heaven or die for hell. I do not judge you for your beliefs nor should you for mine, we don't have that right. The Judge that will do that will say, you have lived according my will and now be blessed with eternal life or go, I never knew you and be lost forever. What will your choice be? I pray it will be life eternal.</span></li>

<li><span class="title">Posted By: Dear Coal Miners</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">You are beautiful people!
You work HARD for the State of West Virginia!
You make sure our lights are on!
You make sure you put food on your table!
Thank You Thank You Thank You!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Unfortunately,the extraction and burning of fossil fuels(oil and coal)are DESTROYING our planet!
PLEASE find a new career or at the very least, please tell your children and grand children to find a different career...
I have no kids, I am 39 years old, if I'm lucky I have another 39 years to live, I am gay and have absolutely no plans on having kids..my point is I have no stake in the outcome of the bad practices leading to the destruction of our world but I do want it to be able to support all forms of life forever!
If a meteorite destroys our world, then that's one thing. But If our world is destroyed because of what WE DO while were here, then that's what we deserve...
We CAN supply electricity to West Virginia WITHOUT coal mining!
I sincerely mean this!

<li><span class="title">Posted By: Vanessa</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Amy Wilcox was a friend of my daughters and what happened to her hit everyone hard.My problem is,why wasn't that monster charged with attempted murder or at least child endangerment when he left his own daughter in that house to fend for herself and to see what her own father was capable of doing.I pray that the babies who were left behind when Amy passed will find a way to get through this and maybe find some peace.My prayers are with them and the rest of Amys' family</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Jane Doe</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">I love you guys! Everyone has THEIR own opinion!! Let it go! Please!!! I have a busy life and don't have time to write everyday like some people I know! Everybody is different and interpret the Bible in different ways! But the truth is the Bible is here for us to read. Whether or not we chose to believe that's up to us! That was why it was written! For everyone to make the decision to live in Heaven forever or in a lake of fire! Good or evil? It's up to you on which path you want to take! Have a good day and God Bless you!!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Baptist Preacher</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Anonymous, It seems you have a problem with facts. The two most convincing proofs I know that testify to the existence of the God of the bible are very specific, detailed propheices and the existence and survival of the Jewish folks and the physical land of Israel. Start in Genesis and go through the Old Testament and you will find the story of these people and their country (that God dearly loves and protects) detailed in very clear terms, centuries before events happened. The birth of Israel in 1948 was a miracle, but was foretold by the prophets of old. The return of the city of Jerusalem, as well. The bible tells us that Jerusalem and the land of Israel will be the focus of the entire world in the latter days, and have you noticed that it is, daily. The bible speaks of cities, countries, political systems, personalities, currencies, languages, peoples, etc..that all existed in history and are verifiable through independent research and artifacts. You are allowing hatred to blind you</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Craveontruth</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Big Earl is not the man,he is not even a man.Big Earl is a group with an agenda.If you check other newspaper blogs,you will probably find similar post of someone named Big something.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Get Rid of the Yell!</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">WSAZ I think you should get rid of the yell!  Everytime I look at the comments on your main web page all I ever see is a bunch of comments from people who are telling each other off so to speak.  Make them exchange email addresses and they can do that in private!  I think it also takes up too much room on your main web page.  Please get rid of this nonsence!

Thank you!!!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: </span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Kieth,Ari, welfare speak,food for thought,you all are so stupid you can't see the difference between faith and facts,religion is not able to survive without faith,facts are the enemy of religion.I have more respect for a person that lives right,and is a plus in their community just because it is the right thing to do ,not because they think they are going to be rewarded with some mythical after life.Most people I have had contact with who say they are religious and live right,are the biggest hypocrites,you all want to spout off on the bible even tho it is obvious you haven't got a clue how it reads or to what time period it pertains to,the truth about believers are they have more divorces,commit more child abuse,hate more people,and act like they are some kind of special holy people while they are doing it.Hollering for their god to strike down and punish those who disagree with them.In my book thats bad people.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: </span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Posted by: food for thought on Jun 15, 2009 at 09:54 AM "About read the Bible--truths in the Bible. ALL THE BIBLE is a GOOD written  fable! Was created by MEN because of the chaotic times! I find it amazing that some many people believe that it is a real thing that supposedly written by the almighty. YES; there is written very well. But come now; things written really happened? YEAH, RIGHT! If you thing it has; then you are living the fantasy world! Jesus was just a man; married and lived a very short life. (Yes; he was a healer in a cosmic sense!) But not the son of God. He was born into this world just like everyone of us by conception!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Deane</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">So, we don't believe alike, can't we still get along with our neighbors. I say wait until you walk in each others shoes before you critisize,make fun of, or just plain don't care who you hurt.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Keith</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Jeannie, so is that the best argument you can come up with that I should buy your families heatlh care, because they don't have a job that provides it? I know this is a novel idea, but when I was in a job that I hated and had bad benefits I pursued and got another that had good ones. It is comical though that you have to remind us that the occupation in question is legitimate, like we would think anything else. Switching gears, dont those folks in Iran know that Big O went to Egypt last week and gave a speech and that everything is going to be fine in Iran? I cant understand what is wrong with those darn mullahs and why they wont make nice now that this great and noble country has been apologized for by our messiah. Love that restored prestige...Hows the hope and change working for everyone? Did you really count on 9.4% unemployment and 16,000 lost jobs per day, along with the govt. taking over banking, auto, and ruining coal, steel, dealerships, etc...Obama is a human wrecking ball.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Ugh</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Big Earl- you are NOT the man.  The bad thing is, you seem somewhat educated, yet you are bashing other human beings.  You are trying to form an army of "hippie haters" and that is just wrong!</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Coalminerbychoice</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Big earl you are the man, i'll by the cold ones anytime and we can set around over a coal burning fire and make fun of all these hippies and how smart they are.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: its late</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">where is every body at wsaz</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: jam6972</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">"Tis better to be thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt!" Does this apply to any one here?</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: food for thought</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">just would like to comment on these people who  say there is no God. this is not an attack on your posts, however get off your backsides, read or better yet have someone (preferably a preacher) and a local church read the Bible to you, and if you can think rationally pay attention to the truths in the Bible. There are many and I would love to point them out to you, yet I am afraid that you would see that this Christian would not get into a war of truth with you. I say truth because God is true. No matter how you look at it, it is appointed to man that we must die, and I pray that God continues to deal with your heart on your road to Damascus.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Jeannie</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Not having health insurance and being irresponsible are separate issues.  There are many, many responsible people out there who have NO health insurance.  With the lack of competition for health insurance policies, insurance companies charge whatever fee they wish to the private individual seeking health insurance.  If you're lucky, you can purchase a BASIC plan for a family of four for around $900/month - IF you have no pre-existing conditions, of which the definition is ever-expanding to include such minor ailments as twice monthly headaches.  I have a close family member whose occupation precludes them from ever being able to purchase health insurance.  Before you jump to conclusions, it's not a "seedy" job; it's a reputable small business.</span></li>
<li><span class="title">Posted By: Big Earl</span>:&nbsp;<span class="headlines">Hello again you good working people of WV coal mining families I seen a story what illustrates why these hippies don’t have no sense they are also inconsiderate and don’t keep there animals penned up like they should. It seems that up in Canada there are a lot of these no good killer grizzly bears on what they call “nature preserves” and no you hippies I am not talking about grape jelly in a wine garden but apparently they don’t have sense enough to not build there commune next to a train track. According to this story the Canadian version of the Wabash cannonball wiped out “Bear number 71” a she bear that was rooting around looking for food. This is a perfect example of why bear hunting should be allowed and encouraged because first off if Big Ben is stuffed and on some lodge wall above a roaring fire or a nice shaggy bear rug he wont be out roaming around on the railroad bothering the train company when they are trying to haul stuff that people use like coal. People just look in your own backyard in WV we have bear season and I am yet to hear of a bear getting run over by a train around here which is a complete waste of a good bear.</span></li>
