<b>1.	Policies for Children Under 13 Years Old</b> 
</a></p><p><a name="under13">
As described below, WNBA.com will not collect or maintain any personal information from children under 13 years old without the express consent of their parent or guardian.  
</a></p><p><a name="under13">
A number of interactive features on WNBA.com  require registration to participate. All registrants will be required to enter their full name, age, zip code and e-mail address and to select a special member name to be used as an identifier for the feature, a password and a secret hint that will help us verify their identity if they forget their password or contact us about their membership.  When a child under 13 years old tries to register for such features on WNBA.com, we also request an e-mail address of the child's parent or guardian which is only used to notify the parent or guardian of the child's attempted registration.  By following the instructions provided in the notice, the parent or guardian will be given the option to approve or decline the child's registration.  In addition, we will send a separate e-mail notification to the child's e-mail address to inform him/her that the registration will not become valid unless we receive approval from his/her parent or guardian.  If the parent or guardian declines the child's registration or fails to approve the registration within the time period specified in the notice, the registration will not be activated and WNBA.com will not retain any personal information submitted by the child. We only request the disclosure of personal information that is reasonably necessary to participate in the feature for which the child is attempting to register. Even after a child's registration is approved by his/her parent or guardian, WNBA.com will not share such information with WNBA business partners.  
</a></p><p><a name="under13">
Children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be able to make credit card purchases (e.g., the WNBA Store Online, WNBA.com Audio Season Pass) or participate in interactive features of WNBA.com that do not require registration but necessitate the collection and retention of personal information (e.g., entering some sweepstakes).  
</a></p><p><a name="under13">
WNBA.com encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on WNBA.com. 
</a></p><p><a name="under13">

</a><a name="over13">
<b>2.	Policies for Individuals 13 Years Old and Older</b> 
</a></p><p><a name="over13">
To participate in some of the interactive features on WNBA.com, you may be required to submit some personal information that allows WNBA.com to fulfill your order or process your request.  Generally, WNBA.com will not share any personal information submitted by you without posting a notification that WNBA.com intends to do so.  With your permission, WNBA.com may share information submitted by you with WNBA business partners that provide promotional material or help to publish our Web site, maintain our database and/or fulfill orders you have made.  You may opt out of receiving materials from such sources at any time by following the procedures in </a><a href="/basics/privacy_policy.html#optout">Section 4</a> below.  
</p><p>
<b>Registration.</b>  You will be required to register to take advantage of some of the interactive activities on WNBA.com . To register, you will need to submit your full name, age, zip code and e-mail address and to select a unique member name to be used as an identifier for the feature, a password and a secret hint, chosen by you, that will help us verify your identity if you forget your password or contact us about your membership. You may also be requested to provide optional information, such as your favorite WNBA team and activity. A few select features on WNBA.com may require payment (e.g., WNBA.com Audio Season Pass) and, in such cases, you will also be required to submit a credit card number and expiration date, complete mailing and/or shipping address, and phone number to be used  for billing purposes. For information about registration for children, please consult <a href="/basics/privacy_policy.html#under13">Section 1</a> in this Privacy Policy.
</p><p>
<b>Purchases.</b>  When making a purchase on WNBA.com or the WNBA Store Online, you will be requested to enter your full name, e-mail address, complete billing and/or shipping address, credit card number and expiration date so we can process and fulfill your order with the merchandise vendor and bill you for the products and/or services you requested.
</p><p>
<b>Other Services. </b> WNBA.com may offer you an opportunity to enter various contests or other promotional features, or you may sign up to receive other information from the WNBA or its teams (e.g., <i>What's Next</i>, the official online newsletter of the WNBA, notification about events in your area or merchandise specials).  The information you will be required to submit will vary, but will typically include your full name, age, and e-mail address.  You may also be requested to answer certain optional survey questions, such as your favorite WNBA team or activity. Information received through such activities will be used by WNBA.com or WNBA teams to send you the requested information or to administer contests and notify prize winners.  Such information may be shared with WNBA business partners, unless you opt out of receiving future mailings at the time you sign up, or later, by following the procedures in <a href="/basics/privacy_policy.html#optout">Section 4</a> below. Unless expressly noted otherwise and verifiable consent is received from a parent or guardian, children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be allowed to sign up for such activities.
</p><p>

<a name="chats">
<b>3.	Participating in Chats and Mailboxes</b>
</a></p><p><a name="chats">
To participate in an online chat or send e-mail to WNBA.com, we will only request a first name, city, state, province or country, and e-mail address which will only be used to acknowledge receipt of the message or to respond to the sender's request when WNBA.com determines that a response is warranted.  WNBA.com does not maintain any of the information collected through such activities in retrievable form or share the information with WNBA business partners for promotional purposes.  Please note that information or statements that are volunteered while participating in a WNBA.com chat or mailbox activity will not be treated as confidential and may be posted on WNBA.com.  You will not be able to change or remove any public postings made once posted.  All submissions will become the property of WNBA.com.  Please review the </a><a href="http://www.wnba.com/basics/termsofuse.html">Terms of Use</a> for more information about making submissions to WNBA.com.
</p><p>

<a name="optout">
<b>4.	Opting Out; Reviewing and Changing Your Information</b>
</a></p><p><a name="optout">
<b>Opting Out.</b>  When you sign up for any feature on WNBA.com, you may choose to opt out of (a) receiving communications from WNBA.com or WNBA teams about new features or services, and (b) receiving communications from third-party companies concerning their products or services.  If you would like to stop such use of your personal information at any time and for any reason, you may notify either WNBA.com or the WNBA team of that preference by modifying your preferences in the online registration area or by following the instructions outlined in any communication e-mailed to you
</a></p><p><a name="optout">
<b>Reviewing and Changing Your Information.</b>  If you wish to modify your registration information or otherwise change your preferences, just click on the "registration" link for the service or activity for which you have registered on WNBA.com or on a WNBA team's Official Web Site. Simply enter your registration member name and password and check the appropriate boxes or enter the new information to modify your registration.  By following the directions posted, you will submit your request to WNBA.com or the WNBA team, respectively, and any information maintained about you will be modified as you requested.  In limited circumstances, we may retain information that you have requested be removed but which cannot be completely deleted from our databases due to technical constraints and the backup of our computer system.
</a></p><p><a name="optout">

</a><a name="security">
<b>5.	Security Policies</b>
</a></p><p><a name="security">
Our Web site uses SSL or "Secure Sockets Layer", an industry standard security protocol. When you place an order on WNBA.com and your credit card information is transmitted, you will connect with our secure server. SSL sends your browser information that encrypts your order, changing all the information that you send back into a code that is extremely difficult to decipher. 
</a></p><p><a name="security">
Please keep in mind that whatever you publicly disclose online - for example in a chat or through e-mail - can be collected and used by others or unlawfully intercepted by third parties.  No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information, WNBA.com cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us  and you do so at your own risk.  In addition, WNBA.com may disclose information to law enforcement or other government officials if we determine such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate, or if we are compelled to disclose it by court order or operation of law.
</a></p><p><a name="security">
Your WNBA.com registration account is password protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to your account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.  Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or account information.  Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.
</a></p><p><a name="security">

</a><a name="cookies">
<b>6.	Use of Cookies</b>
</a></p><p><a name="cookies">
Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to a user's computer hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you are at our site. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. Accepting a cookie does not give anyone access to your computer or to any personal information. It is simply a small file in which we keep information that identifies you as a unique user.  For example, we may use a cookie to indicate when you have already voted in an online poll to prevent multiple voting and a distortion of results.
</a></p><p><a name="cookies">
The use of cookies is an industry standard - you'll find them at most major Web sites. Most browsers are initially configured to accept cookies. However, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.  Although you will still be able to enjoy many of the features on WNBA.com if you disable your browser from accepting cookies, some parts of the WNBA.com service will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, entering contests or playing games.  
</a></p><p><a name="cookies">

</a><a name="surveys">
<b>7.	About IP Addresses and Surveys Used for Research Purposes</b>
</a></p><p><a name="surveys">
An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers - the computers that "serve up" Web pages - automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When users request pages on WNBA.com, our servers log their IP addresses. Some activities within WNBA.com, such as posting a chat message, may display IP addresses along with the user's first name and message.  Please review each activity prior to use and only participate in those that involve the disclosure of  information you are comfortable with sharing.
</a></p><p><a name="surveys">
WNBA.com will also occasionally ask users to complete surveys which we use for general research purposes to improve our site and serve you better.  These surveys are optional and you do not have to answer any survey question to enjoy WNBA.com.
</a></p><p><a name="surveys">
WNBA.com analyzes research statistics compiled from surveys and IP addresses on an aggregated, anonymous basis, for system administration and site usage patterns and may share that analysis with advertisers and WNBA business partners.  However, in rare circumstances, we will use such information to identify a user when necessary to enforce compliance with our </a><a href="http://www.wnba.com/basics/termsofuse.html">Terms of Use</a> or to protect WNBA.com, its users or others.  
</p><p>

<a name="othersites">
<b>8.	Links from WNBA.com to Other Web Sites</b> 
</a></p><p><a name="othersites">
The WNBA.com Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information we 
collect from you on WNBA.com. You may occasionally get cookies from businesses that advertise on WNBA.com which WNBA.com does not control and when you link to the Web sites of third party advertisers, for example through an advertising banner, your use of those sites will be subject to the privacy policies of such third parties, which may differ from WNBA.com's Privacy Policy.  
</a></p><p><a name="othersites">

</a><a name="accept">
<b>9.	Your Acceptance of These Terms</b>
</a></p><p><a name="accept">
By using WNBA.com, you signify your consent to the collection and use of personal information by WNBA.com as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our site.   If we make any material changes to the WNBA.com Privacy Policy, those changes will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of what personal information WNBA.com collects, how that information is used, and under what circumstances WNBA.com discloses that information.  Since this policy may change from time to time, you should check back periodically.  Your continued use of WNBA.com following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
