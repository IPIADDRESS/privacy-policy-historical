At WNBA.com, we are committed to safeguarding your privacy online. We want to assure our 

users that WNBA.com will not willfully disclose any specific individual information about 

you to any third party unless you give us your express permission to do so. <br>
<br>

WNBA.com does not solicit any personally identifiable information from children under the 

age of 13.  Accordingly, children under 13 years old may be restricted from participating in 

certain activities and transactions on WNBA.com (including the WNBA Store on WNBA.com at 

store.WNBA.com). WNBA.com works with (and may provide links to) third party sites that offer 

features described on WNBA.com (e.g., official fantasy games, chatrooms, message boards).  

Such third parties may permit children under the age of 13 to register for these features on 

their sites in accordance with their respective privacy policies. However, WNBA.com does not 

knowingly obtain, retain or use information from anyone who indicates that they are under 13 

years old.  If you would like more information about WNBA.com's policy for collecting 

information from children, please read our <a href="/basics/privacy_policy.html#note">Note to Parents</a> below.<br>
<br>
Please read this Privacy Policy ("Policy") for an explanation of how we will treat 

your personal information.  By using WNBA.com, including any of the Official Team Sites of 

the teams of the Women's National Basketball Association ("WNBA") and the WNBA 

Store on WNBA.com, you consent to the collection and use of personal information as outlined 

in this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use our site. If we make 

any material changes to the Policy, those changes will be posted here so that you are always 

aware of what personal information is collected, how that information is used, and under 

what circumstances that information may be disclosed.  Since this Policy may change from 

time to time, you should check back periodically. Your continued use of WNBA.com following 

the posting of changes to the Policy will signal your acceptance of such changes. <br>
<br>

If you have any questions or comments regarding this Policy, please <a href="/basics/contact.html">Contact the WNBA</a>. <br>

information is collected from you through the site;

<br><b>
1. What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identifiable 

information is collected from you through the site
</b><br><br>

As stated above, WNBA.com does not solicit any personally identifiable information from 

children under the age of 13.  Please review our <a href="/basics/privacy_policy.html#note">Note to Parents</a>, if you have 

any questions regarding our Policy with respect to children. <br>
<br>
WNBA.com does not collect personally identifiable information through the site unless you 

provide that information during registration for various features on the site (e.g., 

newsletters, purchases on the WNBA Store on WNBA.com, etc.).  Information required to 

participate in such features may vary but will typically include your first and last name; 

address including city, state, zip code and country; complete date of birth; and e-mail 

address; and, in the case of making purchases, a credit card number and expiration date.  

You may also be requested to provide a username and password for certain features.  WNBA.com 

will maintain all of the personal information submitted by you in secured servers behind 

corporate firewalls.<br>
<br>
<b>2. The organization collecting the information</b><br>
<br>

WNBA.com is operated by WNBA Enterprises, LLC. WNBA Enterprises, LLC is located at 450 

Harmon Meadow Boulevard, Secaucus, New Jersey, 07094.  Please <a href="/basics/contact.html">Contact the WNBA</a> for more 

information. You can also learn more about any of the 16 teams of the WNBA by referring to 

their respective Official Web Sites located on WNBA.com. 
<br><br>
<b>3. How the information is used</b>
<br><br>
WNBA.com may use information provided at registration or information obtained through third 

parties to offer better targeted products and services to you.  We use targeting to 

customize and enhance your online experience on the site.  The use of information provided 

at registration or obtained through third parties will not be provided to advertisers or 

partners, except in aggregate form, unless you have consented to such use at registration.  

An WNBA.com user may change or update his or her personal information at any time by 

visiting the registration area. <br>
<br>
WNBA.com uses "cookie" technology. Cookies are pieces of information transferred 

to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Such technology is an industry standard and 

is used by most major Web sites. WNBA.com will never use cookies to retrieve information 

from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. In order to effectively use the 

site and some of its features (e.g., WNBA Store on WNBA.com), your 

browser must accept cookies. <br>
<br>
Users should be aware that WNBA.com cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting 

information by advertisers or third parties hosting data for WNBA.com.  If a user does not 

want information collected throught the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most 

browsers that allows the user to deny or accept cookies; however, users should note that 

cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features available on WNBA.com.
<br>
<br>
WNBA.com tracks certain general usage pattern information, including what pages people visit 

and how long they have been registered users.   WNBA.com may log users' IP addresses (the 

group of four numbers separated by periods, such as 123.45.64.89, that identifies a 

particular host computer) for the purposes of system administration, site tracking and 

reporting of aggregate usage information to our marketing and product development teams. 

<br>
<br>
From time to time, WNBA.com may solicit your opinion to determine your preferences and 

dislikes in order to provide you with a better product. These surveys are always optional to 

the user and your decision not to participate in a survey will not affect your status as an 

WNBA.com user. Should you choose to participate, any information you give us may be used in 

aggregate form for marketing purposes, and to enhance your overall experience on our site. 

<br>
<br>
<b>4. With whom the information may be shared</b>
<br><br>
Once again, WNBA.com will not provide any personally identifiable information, other than to 

its affiliates, about you to advertisers or other partners without your consent. As stated 

above, WNBA.com may, however, provide advertisers and/or other partners with anonymous 

aggregated information about our users to illustrate trends and patterns.  All third parties 

with whom we share such information will have independent privacy and data collection 

practices and WNBA.com has no responsibility or liability for their policies or 

actions.<br><br> 
We will never give out any information linking your real name to your screen name unless you 

authorize us to do so, or unless required to do so by law. <br>
<br>
WNBA.com has several partners that can offer valuable products and services to our members. 

From time to time, WNBA.com may give or sell a list from our database of users to these 

third party vendors. These lists will consist of only those users that have "opted 

in" to receiving special offers and promotions during the initial registration process. 

WNBA.com will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that every marketing offer sent 

to an WNBA.com user as a result of the provision of such information contains a link for 

that user to no longer receive such offers. In addition, we may share your information with 

a company that acquires all or substantially all of WNBA.com's assets or in a merger or 

acquisition, but only if such company agrees to abide by this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
While WNBA.com is careful in choosing its partners and advertisers, we are only responsible 

for content on our own site. All third parties associated with WNBA.com (including, but not 

limited to, advertisers, sponsors and other Internet sites) with whom we share information 

have independent privacy and data collection practices. WNBA.com does not control this 

collection of information and is neither responsible nor liable for their independent 

policies or actions. <br>
<br>
<!--
WNBA.com uses DoubleClick, a reputable third party vendor, to serve the advertisements that 

you see on the pages of our site. If you would like to know more about the information 

gathering practices and &quot;opt-out&quot; procedures of our third party ad server, please 

<a
class="aLAFeature" 

href="/redir.html?nav=ArticleList&href=http%3A//www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/">c

lick here</a>.  <br>
<br>-->
<b>5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the 

information</b>
<br><br>
You are not required to receive any mailings that you do not wish to receive. During the 

registration process, you will have the option to sign up to receive newsletters and 

selected sponsor offers and discounts.  You will not receive such information if you do not 

select such options.  If, after you choose to receive such information, you wish to 

discontinue receiving these items, you may change your subscription preferences by visiting 

the registration area or by indicating your preference by following the instructions 

provided within the e-mails received.  If a username and password is required to access the 

feature, you will need to provide such information to update your registration preferences. 

If you have forgotten your password, you may obtain it by visiting the registration area and 

requesting it to be sent to you at the e-mail address you originally provided during 

registration. <br>
<br>
<b>6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or 

alteration of information under our control</b>
<br><br>
WNBA.com has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration 

of the information under its control. The servers for WNBA.com are stored in a physically 

secure and climate controlled off-site facility. Beyond the physical protection of the 

servers, we protect against data loss by regularly backing up data, performing consistency 

checks with independently recorded log files to prevent tampering, and restricting access to 

information on our servers via several user authentication technologies. Our site uses SSL 

or "Secure Sockets Layer", an industry standard security protocol. When you place 

an order on the site and your credit card information is transmitted, you will connect with 

our secure server. SSL sends your browser information that encrypts your order, changing all 

the information that you send back into a code that is extremely difficult to decipher. 

<br><br>
Only those employees needed to carry out the business functions will have access to 

information on individual WNBA.com customers. We train each such employee with respect to 

the WNBA.com Privacy Policy, and those violating these policies will be subject to 

disciplinary action. <br>
<br>
It is important to remember that whatever you transmit or disclose online can be collected 

and used by others or unlawfully intercepted by third parties. No data transmission over the 

Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal 

information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. In 

addition, we may disclose information to law enforcement or other government officials if we 

determine such disclosure to be appropriate, or if we are compelled to disclose it by court 

order or operation of law. <br><br>
<!--
Your myWNBA personalization account is password protected so that only you can access it and 

view the user information relevant to your account. We recommend that you do not divulge 

your password to anyone. At no time will any WNBA.com employee or company representative ask 

for your password via e-mail. If you ever receive such an inquiry, please <a
 href="/basics/contact.html">Contact the WNBA</a> 

immediately.  

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your screen names, 

passwords and/or other account information.<br>
<br>--->

Any information voluntarily disclosed by users and posted on our site (on message boards 

and/or in chat areas) may be viewed and used by others. If users post personal information 

that is accessible to the public online, the user does so at his or her own risk. Users 

accept that they may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. <br><br>
<b>7. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information</b>
<br><br>
You will also have the option to correct any inaccuracies in any registration on WNBA.com by 

returning to the registration area and updating your profile and preferences. If a username 

and password is required to access the feature, you will need to provide such information to 

update your registration information. If you have forgotten your password, you may obtain it 

by visiting the registration area and requesting it to be sent to you at the e-mail address 

you originally provided during registration. <br>

<br>
<a name="note"><center><b>WNBA.COM NOTE TO PARENTS</b></center></a>
<br>
It is WNBA.com's policy not to solicit any personally identifiable information from 

children. A number of interactive features on WNBA.com require registration to participate 

(e.g., e-mail newsletters). All registrants will be required to enter their full name, age, 

zip code and e-mail address.  In some cases, users will be required to select a special user 

name to be used as an identifier for the feature and must also enter a password and a secret 

hint that will help us verify their identity if they forget their password. If WNBA.com 

determines that a person is under the age of 13, based on the information provided during 

the registration process, that person will not be permitted to register for features 

requiring the submission of personal information, in accordance with the Children's Online 

Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Instead, when a child under 13 years old tries to register 

for such features on WNBA.com, he or she will be directed to content which does not involve 

the submission of personal information.  Any personally identifiable information that the 

child may have attempted to enter during the registration process will not be collected or 

maintained by WNBA.com. Children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be 

able to make credit card purchases or participate in interactive features on WNBA.com that 

involve the collection and retention of personal information (e.g., entering a sweepstakes). 

<br><br>
WNBA.com works with (and may provide links to) third party sites that offer features 

described on WNBA.com. Such third parties may permit children under the age of 13 to 

register for these features on their sites in accordance with their respective privacy 

policies. Features that permit registration by children under 13 years old include WNBA 

official fantasy games (e.g., WNBA Virtual GM) hosted by ESPN.com and chatrooms hosted by 

Yahoo.com.  Registration for these features is pursuant to the privacy policies of the third 

parties operating the websites on which registration occurs.  For more information, please 

review the privacy policies of each respective third party site.  WNBA.com does not 

knowingly obtain, retain or use information from anyone who indicates that they are under 13 

years old.<br><br>

At WNBA.com, we are committed to safeguarding your privacy online. We want to assure our 

users that WNBA.com will not willfully disclose any specific individual information about 

you to any third party unless you give us your express permission to do so. <br>
<br>

WNBA.com does not solicit any personally identifiable information from children under the 

age of 13.  Accordingly, children under 13 years old may be restricted from participating in 

certain activities and transactions on WNBA.com (including the WNBA Store on WNBA.com at 

store.WNBA.com). WNBA.com works with (and may provide links to) third party sites that offer 

features described on WNBA.com (e.g., official fantasy games, chatrooms, message boards).  

Such third parties may permit children under the age of 13 to register for these features on 

their sites in accordance with their respective privacy policies. However, WNBA.com does not 

knowingly obtain, retain or use information from anyone who indicates that they are under 13 

years old.  If you would like more information about WNBA.com's policy for collecting 

information from children, please read our <a href="/basics/privacy_policy.html#note">Note to Parents</a> below.<br>
<br>
Please read this Privacy Policy ("Policy") for an explanation of how we will treat 

your personal information.  By using WNBA.com, including any of the Official Team Sites of 

the teams of the Women's National Basketball Association ("WNBA") and the WNBA 

Store on WNBA.com, you consent to the collection and use of personal information as outlined 

in this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use our site. If we make 

any material changes to the Policy, those changes will be posted here so that you are always 

aware of what personal information is collected, how that information is used, and under 

what circumstances that information may be disclosed.  Since this Policy may change from 

time to time, you should check back periodically. Your continued use of WNBA.com following 

the posting of changes to the Policy will signal your acceptance of such changes. <br>
<br>

If you have any questions or comments regarding this Policy, please <a href="/basics/contact.html">Contact the WNBA</a>. <br>

1. What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identifiable 

information is collected from you through the site
</b><br><br>

As stated above, WNBA.com does not solicit any personally identifiable information from 

children under the age of 13.  Please review our <a href="/basics/privacy_policy.html#note">Note to Parents</a>, if you have 

any questions regarding our Policy with respect to children. <br>
<br>
WNBA.com does not collect personally identifiable information through the site unless you 

provide that information during registration for various features on the site (e.g., 

newsletters, purchases on the WNBA Store on WNBA.com, etc.).  Information required to 

participate in such features may vary but will typically include your first and last name; 

address including city, state, zip code and country; complete date of birth; and e-mail 

address; and, in the case of making purchases, a credit card number and expiration date.  

You may also be requested to provide a username and password for certain features.  WNBA.com 

will maintain all of the personal information submitted by you in secured servers behind 

corporate firewalls.<br>
<br>
<b>2. The organization collecting the information</b><br>
<br>

WNBA.com is operated by WNBA Enterprises, LLC. WNBA Enterprises, LLC is located at 450 

Harmon Meadow Boulevard, Secaucus, New Jersey, 07094.  Please <a href="/basics/contact.html">Contact the WNBA</a> for more 

information. You can also learn more about any of the 16 teams of the WNBA by referring to 

their respective Official Web Sites located on WNBA.com. 
<br><br>
<b>3. How the information is used</b>
<br><br>
WNBA.com may use information provided at registration or information obtained through third 

parties to offer better targeted products and services to you.  We use targeting to 

customize and enhance your online experience on the site.  The use of information provided 

at registration or obtained through third parties will not be provided to advertisers or 

partners, except in aggregate form, unless you have consented to such use at registration.  

An WNBA.com user may change or update his or her personal information at any time by 

visiting the registration area. <br>
<br>
WNBA.com uses "cookie" technology. Cookies are pieces of information transferred 

to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Such technology is an industry standard and 

is used by most major Web sites. WNBA.com will never use cookies to retrieve information 

from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. In order to effectively use the 

site and some of its features (e.g., WNBA Store on WNBA.com), your 

browser must accept cookies. <br>
<br>
Users should be aware that WNBA.com cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting 

information by advertisers or third parties hosting data for WNBA.com.  If a user does not 

want information collected throught the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most 

browsers that allows the user to deny or accept cookies; however, users should note that 

cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features available on WNBA.com.
<br>
<br>
WNBA.com tracks certain general usage pattern information, including what pages people visit 

and how long they have been registered users.   WNBA.com may log users' IP addresses (the 

group of four numbers separated by periods, such as 123.45.64.89, that identifies a 

particular host computer) for the purposes of system administration, site tracking and 

reporting of aggregate usage information to our marketing and product development teams. 

<br>
<br>
From time to time, WNBA.com may solicit your opinion to determine your preferences and 

dislikes in order to provide you with a better product. These surveys are always optional to 

the user and your decision not to participate in a survey will not affect your status as an 

WNBA.com user. Should you choose to participate, any information you give us may be used in 

aggregate form for marketing purposes, and to enhance your overall experience on our site. 

<br>
<br>
<b>4. With whom the information may be shared</b>
<br><br>
Once again, WNBA.com will not provide any personally identifiable information, other than to 

its affiliates, about you to advertisers or other partners without your consent. As stated 

above, WNBA.com may, however, provide advertisers and/or other partners with anonymous 

aggregated information about our users to illustrate trends and patterns.  All third parties 

with whom we share such information will have independent privacy and data collection 

practices and WNBA.com has no responsibility or liability for their policies or 

actions.<br><br> 
We will never give out any information linking your real name to your screen name unless you 

authorize us to do so, or unless required to do so by law. <br>
<br>
WNBA.com has several partners that can offer valuable products and services to our members. 

From time to time, WNBA.com may give or sell a list from our database of users to these 

third party vendors. These lists will consist of only those users that have "opted 

in" to receiving special offers and promotions during the initial registration process. 

WNBA.com will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that every marketing offer sent 

to an WNBA.com user as a result of the provision of such information contains a link for 

that user to no longer receive such offers. In addition, we may share your information with 

a company that acquires all or substantially all of WNBA.com's assets or in a merger or 

acquisition, but only if such company agrees to abide by this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
While WNBA.com is careful in choosing its partners and advertisers, we are only responsible 

for content on our own site. All third parties associated with WNBA.com (including, but not 

limited to, advertisers, sponsors and other Internet sites) with whom we share information 

have independent privacy and data collection practices. WNBA.com does not control this 

collection of information and is neither responsible nor liable for their independent 

policies or actions. <br>
<br>
<!--
WNBA.com uses DoubleClick, a reputable third party vendor, to serve the advertisements that 

you see on the pages of our site. If you would like to know more about the information 

gathering practices and &quot;opt-out&quot; procedures of our third party ad server, please

<br>-->
<b>5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the 

information</b>
<br><br>
You are not required to receive any mailings that you do not wish to receive. During the 

registration process, you will have the option to sign up to receive newsletters and 

selected sponsor offers and discounts.  You will not receive such information if you do not 

select such options.  If, after you choose to receive such information, you wish to 

discontinue receiving these items, you may change your subscription preferences by visiting 

the registration area or by indicating your preference by following the instructions 

provided within the e-mails received.  If a username and password is required to access the 

feature, you will need to provide such information to update your registration preferences. 

If you have forgotten your password, you may obtain it by visiting the registration area and 

requesting it to be sent to you at the e-mail address you originally provided during 

registration. <br>
<br>
<b>6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or 

alteration of information under our control</b>
<br><br>
WNBA.com has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration 

of the information under its control. The servers for WNBA.com are stored in a physically 

secure and climate controlled off-site facility. Beyond the physical protection of the 

servers, we protect against data loss by regularly backing up data, performing consistency 

checks with independently recorded log files to prevent tampering, and restricting access to 

information on our servers via several user authentication technologies. Our site uses SSL 

or "Secure Sockets Layer", an industry standard security protocol. When you place 

an order on the site and your credit card information is transmitted, you will connect with 

our secure server. SSL sends your browser information that encrypts your order, changing all 

the information that you send back into a code that is extremely difficult to decipher. 

<br><br>
Only those employees needed to carry out the business functions will have access to 

information on individual WNBA.com customers. We train each such employee with respect to 

the WNBA.com Privacy Policy, and those violating these policies will be subject to 

disciplinary action. <br>
<br>
It is important to remember that whatever you transmit or disclose online can be collected 

and used by others or unlawfully intercepted by third parties. No data transmission over the 

Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal 

information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. In 

addition, we may disclose information to law enforcement or other government officials if we 

determine such disclosure to be appropriate, or if we are compelled to disclose it by court 

order or operation of law. <br><br>
<!--
Your myWNBA personalization account is password protected so that only you can access it and 

view the user information relevant to your account. We recommend that you do not divulge 

your password to anyone. At no time will any WNBA.com employee or company representative ask 

for your password via e-mail. If you ever receive such an inquiry, please <a
 href="/basics/contact.html">Contact the WNBA</a> 

immediately.  

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your screen names, 

passwords and/or other account information.<br>
<br>--->

Any information voluntarily disclosed by users and posted on our site (on message boards 

and/or in chat areas) may be viewed and used by others. If users post personal information 

that is accessible to the public online, the user does so at his or her own risk. Users 

accept that they may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. <br><br>
<b>7. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information</b>
<br><br>
You will also have the option to correct any inaccuracies in any registration on WNBA.com by 

returning to the registration area and updating your profile and preferences. If a username 

and password is required to access the feature, you will need to provide such information to 

update your registration information. If you have forgotten your password, you may obtain it 

by visiting the registration area and requesting it to be sent to you at the e-mail address 

you originally provided during registration. <br>

<a name="note"><center><b>WNBA.COM NOTE TO PARENTS</b></center></a>
<br>
It is WNBA.com's policy not to solicit any personally identifiable information from 

children. A number of interactive features on WNBA.com require registration to participate 

(e.g., e-mail newsletters). All registrants will be required to enter their full name, age, 

zip code and e-mail address.  In some cases, users will be required to select a special user 

name to be used as an identifier for the feature and must also enter a password and a secret 

hint that will help us verify their identity if they forget their password. If WNBA.com 

determines that a person is under the age of 13, based on the information provided during 

the registration process, that person will not be permitted to register for features 

requiring the submission of personal information, in accordance with the Children's Online 

Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Instead, when a child under 13 years old tries to register 

for such features on WNBA.com, he or she will be directed to content which does not involve 

the submission of personal information.  Any personally identifiable information that the 

child may have attempted to enter during the registration process will not be collected or 

maintained by WNBA.com. Children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be 

able to make credit card purchases or participate in interactive features on WNBA.com that 

involve the collection and retention of personal information (e.g., entering a sweepstakes). 

<br><br>
WNBA.com works with (and may provide links to) third party sites that offer features 

described on WNBA.com. Such third parties may permit children under the age of 13 to 

register for these features on their sites in accordance with their respective privacy 

policies. Features that permit registration by children under 13 years old include WNBA 

official fantasy games (e.g., WNBA Virtual GM) hosted by ESPN.com and chatrooms hosted by 

Yahoo.com.  Registration for these features is pursuant to the privacy policies of the third 

parties operating the websites on which registration occurs.  For more information, please 

review the privacy policies of each respective third party site.  WNBA.com does not 

knowingly obtain, retain or use information from anyone who indicates that they are under 13 

years old.<br><br>
