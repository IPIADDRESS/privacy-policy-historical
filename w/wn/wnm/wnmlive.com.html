                <p>
                    We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we
intend to always keep that trust. This starts with making sure you understand
the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices
regarding your information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in
plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.
                </p>

                <h3>1. WHO WE ARE</h3>

                <p>
                    <b>Social Foundry, LLC</b><br>
                    16192 Coastal Highway<br>
                    Lewes, Delaware 19958<br>
                    United States
                </p>

                <h3>2. WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES</h3>

                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and
other services operated by Social Foundry, such as Nearby. For simplicity, we
refer to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. To make it
extra clear, we’ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable
services.
                </p>

                <h3>3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

                <p>
                    It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful
connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details
and your location. We also collect information generated as you use our
services, for example access logs, as well as information from third parties,
like when you access our services through a social media account. If you want
additional info, we go into more detail below.
                </p>

                <p><i>Information you give us</i></p>

                <p>
                    You choose to give us certain information when using our
services. This includes:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p style="">
                            <span><span></span></span>When you create an account, you provide us with at least your
login credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to
work, such as your name and location.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="">
                            <span><span></span></span>When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional
information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and
other details about you, as well as content such as photos. To add certain
content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or
photo album. Some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered
“special” or “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or
ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. By choosing to
provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="">
                            <span><span></span></span>When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly
from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us
or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit
card number or other financial information.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                            <span><span></span></span>If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information
you give us during the interaction. Sometimes, we monitor or record these
interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="">
                            <span><span></span></span>Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as
the content you publish, as part of the operation of the services.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><i>Information we receive from others</i></p>

                <p>
                    In addition to the information you provide us directly, we
receive information about you from others, including:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p style="">
                            <span><span></span></span>Other users may provide information about you as they use our
services. For instance, we may collect information about you from other users
if they contact us about you.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                            <span><span></span></span>You may be able to use your social media login (such as Facebook
Login or Google Login) to create and log into your Nearby account. This saves
you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you
to share some information from your social media account with us.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    When you use our services, we collect information about
which features you’ve used, how you’ve used them and the devices you use to

how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you’ve been
using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring
webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other
users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your

service and device you’re using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.
If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not
collect it, but your ability to use and enjoy our Services may be limited as a
result. Similarly, if you consent, we may collect your photos and videos (for
instance, if you want to publish a photo, video or streaming on the services).
                </p>

                <h3>4. COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES</h3>

                <p>
                    We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar
technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your
device(s). We use these for the purpose of authenticating you, remembering your
preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and
measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, and allowing you to use
social features. You can learn how you can better control their use, through
your browser settings and other tools.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer,
Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“<b>DNT</b>”) feature that tells a
website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked.
If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser
can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s
user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.
For this reason, many businesses, including Social Foundry, do not currently
respond to DNT signals.
                </p>

                <h3>5. HOW WE USE INFORMATION</h3>

                <p>
                    The main reason we use your information is to deliver and
improve our services. Additionally, we use your info to help keep you safe and
to provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you. Read on for a
more detailed explanation of the various reasons we use your information,
together with practical examples.

                <h3>6. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</h3>

                <p>
                    Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections,
the main sharing of users’ information is, of course, with other users. We also
share some users’ information with service providers and partners who assist us
in operating the services, and, in some cases, legal authorities. Read on for
more details about how your information is shared with others.
                </p>

                <p><i>With other users</i></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You share information with other users when you voluntarily
disclose information on the service (including your public profile). Please be
careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff
that you’re comfortable being viewable by anyone since neither you nor we can
control what others do with your information once you share it.
                </li>
                </ul>

                <p><i>With our service providers and partners</i></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We use third parties to help us operate and improve our
services. These third parties assist us with various tasks, including data
hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising,
payment processing and security operations.
                </li>
                    <li>We may also share information with partners who distribute
and assist us in advertising our services. For instance, we may share limited
information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising partners.
                </li>
                    <li>We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any
service provider or working with any partner. All of our service providers and
partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.
                </li>
                </ul>

                <p><i>For corporate transactions</i></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether
in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture,
restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of
ownership or control.
                </li>
                </ul>

                <p><i>When required by law</i></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary:
(i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search
warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal
requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject
in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.
                </li>
                </ul>

                <p><i>To enforce legal rights</i></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would
mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to
protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or
other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to
investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity,
suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.
                </li>
                </ul>

                <p><i>With your consent or at your request</i></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We may ask for your consent to share your information with
third parties. In any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the
information.
                </li>
                    <li>Your profile data is generally public and available to be
viewed by anyone, including search engines, who might index your information for
display in their search results. We may use and share non-personal information
(meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as
device information, general demographics, general behavioral data, geolocation
in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human
readable form, under any of the above circumstances.
                </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>7. CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS</h3>

                <p>
                    Sharing of information laid out in&nbsp;Section 6&nbsp;sometimes
involves cross-border data transfers, for instance to the United States of
America, Canada, and other jurisdictions. As an example, where the service
allows for users to be located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), their
personal information is transferred to countries outside of the EEA. We use
standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission or other suitable
safeguard to permit data transfers from the EEA to other countries. Standard
contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal
data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data
                </p>

for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and
location services as well as push notifications. You can change your settings
on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding

                    If you are a California resident, you can request a notice
disclosing the categories of personal information about you that we have shared

                <p>
                    We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or
alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all
technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do
not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always
remain secure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We regularly monitor our systems for possible
vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection,
storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and
organizational security measures.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We may suspend your use of all or part of the services
without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe
that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us
immediately.
                </p>

                <h3>11. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

                <p>
                    We keep your personal information only as long as we need it
for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in&nbsp;Section 5) and as permitted
by applicable law. To protect the safety and security of our users on and off
our services, we implement a safety retention window of 30 days following
account deletion or twelve months following account suspension. During this
period, account information will be retained although the account will of
course not be visible on the services anymore.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon
deletion or suspension of your account (following the safety retention window),
unless:
