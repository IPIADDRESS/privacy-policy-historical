<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="box-content">The visitors (the "User") of the <strong>W3links.net</strong> websites are in control of the use of information they provide to <strong>W3links.net,</strong> or one of its current or future affiliate members ("Affiliate Members"). <strong>W3links.net </strong>is committed to respecting the privacy rights of Users to the <strong>W3links.net </strong>website (the "Site"). While visiting the Site, we may ask Users to provide personal information ("Personal Information") for purposes of interacting with the Site. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.<br>
<br>
Please see the Effective Date stated at the conclusion of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and dissemination of information that we collect from Users. To the extent that Users disclose any such information to other parties, through other web sites on the Internet linked to this site or otherwise, THIS PRIVACY POLICY SHALL NOT APPLY TO SUCH DISCLOSURE.

Therefore, we encourage Users to ask questions before they disclose Personal Information to other parties.<br>
