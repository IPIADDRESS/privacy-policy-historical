      "Cookies" are more than just tasty desserts. We use cookies to help give

    </p>

    <p>
      Cookies fall into four categories: Strictly Necessary, Performance
      or Analytical, Functionality, and Targeting.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also use Google Analytics, a third-party tracking service, which uses

        If you have told us you are happy for us to process your personal information
        for a specific purpose.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong>
        If the processing is necessary for us to conduct our business, but not
        where our interests are overridden by your interests or rights.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong>
        If we must process your personal information in order to be able to provide
        you with one of our products or services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prevention of Fraud:</strong>

        <strong>Public Information:</strong>
        Where we process personal information which you have already made public.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal Claims:</strong>
        The processing of your personal information is necessary for the establishment,
        exercise or defense of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their
        judicial capacity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal Obligation:</strong>
        We are required to process your personal information by law.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-3 mb-1">
      When You Submit an Offer or Inquiry Through Our Website or the Venture System
    </h2>

    <p>
      When you submit an offer or inquiry via our Site or the Venture.com system,
      we ask you for your name, contact telephone number and email address.
    </p>

    <p>
      We use this information to respond to your offer or inquiry, including
      among other things, providing you with any requested information about the
      requested domain name and our services. We may also email or call you several
      times after your inquiry in order to follow up on your interest and ensure
      that we have answered it to your satisfaction. We will do this based on our
      legitimate interest in providing accurate information prior to a lease or transaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your inquiry is processed and logged on a CRM system on a cloud server based
      in Canada; a country, which the EU says has adequate data protection laws
      in place to protect your data.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not use the information you provide to make any automated decisions that might affect you.
    </p>


    <h2 class="mt-3 mb-1">When You Lease a Domain Name through Venture</h2>

    <p>
      To fully use our services, you will need to register for an account. During
      this process, you are required to provide us with your contact information
      and other personal information such as your name, email address, and billing address.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you lease a Domain Name online, we ask you for your name, address,
      contact telephone number, email address and credit card information or
      banking information. We also record your IP (Internet Protocol) address,
      which is the address of your computer on the Internet.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will use your information to verify your credit card details to process
      your order and may provide certain information to a third-party escrow provider
      to handle the financial transaction. We may use your telephone number to
      contact you regarding your lease fee. We require this information in order
      to process your payment, deliver your products or services and fulfil our contract with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you successfully lease a domain name, we may also collect some additional
      information including name servers, administrative contacts, business identification,
      and other information for registrars.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your information is stored on our website and on our cloud server, both of
      which are based within the European Union. Your credit card details are passed
      to a third-party payment processor which is based in the USA and is certified to
      the EU-US Privacy Shield (which requires effective safeguards for your information).
      We do not retain your credit card information.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not use the information you provide to make any automated decisions that might affect you.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-3 mb-1">When You Submit a Review</h2>

    <p>
      When you submit a review about us we record your name, your email address
      and your IP (Internet Protocol) address, which is the address of your computer
      on the Internet.
    </p>

    <p>
      We use this information to provide verified independent views about our
      services to potential customers. Your name and the content of your review
      (but not your email address or IP address) may be publicly displayed on
      our website. We will do this based on our legitimate interest in marketing
      our services.
    </p>

    <p>
