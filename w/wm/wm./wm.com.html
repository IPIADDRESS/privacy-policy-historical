<br><div class="content"> 
  <p> </p>
  <p>Waste Management (“Waste Management”, “we”, “us” 
    or “our”) respects the preferences of our customers and other users 
    that access this Internet site to learn about or interact with us concerning 
    the collection, storage, access and use of their personal and business information. 
    Waste Management is continually developing mechanisms to enhance the user 
    experience on this web site and to provide our users with greater choice related 
    to information use and disclosure. By accessing the Waste Management web site 
    (the “Site”), you agree to the Waste Management Privacy Policy. 
    It is important that you review this Privacy Policy prior to registering on 
    or using the Site. </p>
  <p>Waste Management reserves the right to add to, update or otherwise modify 
    this Privacy Policy at any time and we will post the revision date on this 
    Privacy Policy page. If we make material changes to this policy, we will post 
    notice of the change on our Home Page. The most current Privacy Policy will 
    apply to all data and other information collected on the Site, no matter what 
    version of the Privacy Policy was in effect when the information was collected. 
  </p>
  <p>In general, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing 
    any information about yourself. Our Web servers may collect the domain names, 
    not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. This information is aggregated to measure 
    the number of visits, average time spent on the Site, pages viewed, and similar 
    data. Waste Management uses this information to measure the use of our Site 
    and to improve the content of our Site. There are times, however, when we 
    may need personal information from you, for instance: to process an order, 
    to correspond with you, to provide a service, or in connection with a job 
    application. However, we will only collect this information when it is voluntarily 
    submitted to us. When any personal information is collected, we will let you 
    know, at the time of collection, how we will use the information you give 
    to us by reference to this Privacy Policy. </p>
  <p>Your Personal Information: <br>
    Waste Management will use personally identifiable information voluntarily 
    submitted to us to respond to requests you make of us or to contact you in 
    connection with your requests. Additionally, Waste Management may use that 
    information to determine how we can improve our Site, business and services. 
    Any and all uses will comply with applicable law. </p>
  <p>In addition, we may use a technology called “cookies.” A cookie 
    is a tiny element of data that a Web site (including our Site) can send to 
    your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize 
    you when you return. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive 
    a cookie. </p>
  <p>As a general rule, we do not sell or rent your personal or business information 
    to any third party, except as described below or in connection with effectively 
    maintaining and operating the Site. However, Waste Management cooperates with 
    law enforcement and judicial inquires and other third parties to enforce laws, 
    intellectual property and other rights. It may be necessary to furnish your 
    information to third parties in connection with these objectives. </p>
  <p>If you are using features of the Site available exclusively for Waste Management 
    shareholders, we may request your social security number or tax id to verify 
    your identity and share ownership. </p>
  <p>If you are using the Site to access our electronic payment system, we may 
    request certain financial information so that we may effect the payment transaction. 
    Our payment system may collect, store and use non-public personally identifiable 
    information such as your name, address, credit card number, bank routing and 
    account number, Waste Management account number and e-mail address to process 
    your payments. In addition, the payment system will also collect information 
    regarding the actual bill payment transactions, including the dates and amounts 
    paid. Waste Management will store and protect this information in the same 
    manner we store and protect other personal customer information, and this 
    is true both for our current customers as well as our former customers. We 
    will only disclose information to third parties about your account or the 
    transfers you make: </p>
  <p>Where it is necessary for completing transactions you authorize (for example, 
    to an outside service provider that operates the electronic payment system 
    for us), or <br>
    In order to verify the existence and condition of your account for a third 
    party, such as a credit bureau or <br>
    In order to comply with government agency or court orders, or <br>
    If you give us your written permission. <br>
    We may disclose the information we collect about you to our affiliates who 
    offer you waste management and disposal services, and to nonaffiliated third 
    parties that perform services on our behalf, including marketing services, 
    or parties with whom we have joint services and/or joint marketing agreements. 
    We reserve the right to provide non-personal identifying information, such 
    as aggregate data, to third parties. </p>
  <p>Waste Management is concerned with the security of the data and information 
    we collect and we use commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural 
    safeguards to help ensure the security, integrity and privacy of all personal 
    information. However, due to the inherent insecurity of the Internet, no security 
    measures should be viewed as one hundred percent effective in all circumstances. 
    Waste Management cannot absolutely guarantee against a breach of its security 
    or the actions of third parties that may seek to obtain unauthorized access 
    to personal information. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>In the event of a security breach in which personal information has been 
    acquired, or is reasonably believed to have been acquired, by an unauthorized 
    person, and where applicable law requires notification, Waste Management will 
    notify the affected individual of the breach electronically, by email or fax, 
    or if unable to contact the individual electronically, then by US Mail. This 
    notice will be given in a timely manner, consistent with legitimate needs 
    of law enforcement and any measures necessary for Waste Management or law 
    enforcement to determine the scope of the breach and to restore and assure 
    the integrity of the data system. <br>
    <br>
    In the case where law enforcement determines that notification will impede 
    a criminal investigation, Waste Management may delay notification until law 
    enforcement or we determine that notification will not compromise the investigation.</p>
