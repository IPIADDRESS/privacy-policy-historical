<h2 id="Section1">1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h2>
<p>We collect several types of information about visitors and/or users of our Services. We may collect this information either directly when you provide it to us or automatically as you navigate through the Websites or App.</p>
<p>(a) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personally Identifiable Information</span>. ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ refers to information by which you may be personally identified, such as your name, email address, or school. We will collect and process such data about you when you register for a Service/create an account, subscribe to a newsletter, submit feedback, enter a contest, fill out a survey, or send us a communication. When ordering products or services on the Websites or App, you may also be asked to provide a credit card number and other payment-related information. You may also provide information to be published or displayed <strong>(“posted”)</strong> on public areas of the Websites (such as blogs, forums, message boards, and the like), or transmitted to other users of the Websites using ‘sharing’ features <strong>(collectively, “User Contributions”)</strong>. Your User Contributions are posted and transmitted to others at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of the Websites with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.</p>
<p>We may also collect your Internet Protocol (‘IP’) address. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Services and to gather demographic information.</p>
<p>We do not collect more Personally Identifiable Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity on the Websites. If you are a school and you use a lynda.com service within the United States for children under the age of 13, you are responsible for obtaining consent from the parents/legal guardians of each child you wish to allow to participate in using any of our Services. A child using our Services will be able to participate in certain activities such as taking online educational and informational courses.</p>
<p>(b) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-Personally Identifiable Information</span>. We may collect, or our third party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information, that does not by itself identify a specific individual. Such information tells us about your equipment, browsing actions, the resources that you access and use through the Services, your operating system and browser type. Our third party ad servers will provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at our Websites. The information that we collect automatically is ‘statistical’ in nature. It helps us to deliver a better and more personalized service to users, by enabling us to estimate usage patterns, customize our Services according to your individual preferences, and speed up your searches.</p>
<p>(c) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Device Information</span>. When you download our App and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use and the operating system version, so we know the best application version to provide you with. We do not ask you for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our App or Services.</p>
<h2 id="Section2">2. WHERE WE STORE DATA</h2>
<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area <strong>(“EEA”)</strong>. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. lynda.com will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2 id="Section3">3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="privacy-policy">
<li>To ensure that content from our Services is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer or mobile device</li>
<li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes</li>
<li>To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection</li>
<li>If you pay for Services using a credit card, we will transmit your credit card data to the appropriate credit card company and/or credit card payment processing company</li>
<li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our Services, when you choose to do so</li>
<li>To notify you about changes to our Services</li>
<li>In any other way we may describe when you provide the information</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you.</p>
<p>If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this.</p>
<p>If you use the <em>Contact Us</em> form on our site, we will respond to your inquiry and delete the information provided after your request has been fulfilled.</p>
<h2 id="Section4">4. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We will share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. Parents have the right to allow the collection and use of Personal Information from a Child without also consenting to its disclosure to Third Parties. We do not sell, trade, rent or disclose your information to others, except as provided herein:</p>
<p>(a) We provide some of our Services through contractual arrangements with service providers and other third parties. We and our service partners use your Personally Identifiable Information to operate our Websites and to deliver Services. For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on our Websites; release your address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered; and provide order information to third parties that help us deliver the services.</p>
<p>(b) We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in the following circumstances: (i) if it is required by law enforcement or judicial authorities, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation; (ii) if we have a good faith belief that we are required or permitted to do so by law or legal process; (iii) to protect the rights, reputation, property or safety of lynda.com or others; (iv) to defend or enforce our rights or your obligations; (v) if the disclosure is required by mandatory professional standards; (vi) to a 3rd party with your prior consent to do so; or (vii) if we are under a duty to disclose or share your Personally Identifiable Information in order to enforce or apply, or any contracts or agreement that may exist between you and lynda.com including this Privacy Policy and our Website Use Policy. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p>(c) In the event that lynda.com decides to sell all or part of its stock or assets or enter into a merger, we reserve the right to include Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information among the assets transferred to the acquiring or surviving company.</p>
<p>(d) We may provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers’ sales, traffic patterns, and related Website information to third party advertisers.</p>
<p>(e) Parents are able to consent to the use of their child’s Personally Identifiable Information without having to consent to the Website’s disclosure of the child’s Personally Identifiable Information to third parties, as we do not share Personally Identifiable Information of children under the age of 13 with any third parties (other than those service partners who help us provide the lynda.com service to you).</p>

<h2 id="Section8">8. INFORMATION RELATED TO DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THE LYNDA.COM PLATFORM SERVICE</h2>
<p>For certain services lynda.com collects information under the direction of its clients (e.g., an entity that subscribes to the Services for use by the entity’s personnel). In this respect, lynda.com acts as a data processor and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personally Identifiable Information it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his or her query to the relevant lynda.com client (the data controller). If the client makes a request to us to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 days.</p>
<p>lynda.com will retain Personally Identifiable Information we process on behalf of our clients for as long as needed to provide our services to our client. We will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<h2 id="Section9">9. DATA SECURITY</h2>
<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.</p>
<p>To make online purchases you must use an SSL-enabled browser in order to protect the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.</p>
<p>Access by you to your account is available through a password and/or unique user name selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone, that you change your password often using a combination of letters and numbers, and that you ensure you use a secure web browser. We cannot be held accountable for activity that results from your own neglect to safeguard the secrecy of your password and user name. If you share a computer with anyone, you should always log out of your account after you are finished, in order to prevent access to your information from subsequent users of that computer.</p>
<p>Please notify us as soon as possible if your user name or password is compromised. Call 1 (888) 335-9632 or +1 (805) 477-3900 for assistance, or email <a href="mailto:businessaffairs@lynda.com">businessaffairs@lynda.com</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Website cannot be guaranteed and we shall have no liability to you or any third party for loss, misuse, disclosure or alteration of such information; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personally Identifiable Information in our control may have been compromised, we will notify you as promptly as possible under the circumstances. To the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification</span>. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:businessaffairs@lynda.com">businessaffairs@lynda.com</a> with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.</p>
<h2 id="Section10">10. COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
<p>When you use our Websites we may use cookies and other technologies in order to facilitate and customize your use of our Services.</p>
<p><strong>What is a cookie?</strong> A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer or mobile device (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us.</p>
<p>Our cookies store randomly assigned user identification numbers, the country where you are located, and your first name to welcome you back to our Websites. The cookies make your use of the Websites easier, make the Websites run more smoothly, and save your logged-in state so that you do not have to log in each time that you visit the Websites.</p>
<p>The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers, is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, and service providers, use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, in order for you to use the shopping cart, etc.</p>
<p>You can disable and/or delete all types of cookies by using your browser settings. Cookies are generally easy to disable and/or delete but how you do so varies from browser to browser. The “help” function within your browser should tell you how to do it. The best way may be to close your browser and then search for “cookie folder” or “cookie manager” or simply “cookie”. Please also visit www.allaboutcookies.org for more information about cookies and how to disable them. If you do disable cookies, our Websites will not recognize you and you may not have access to all portions of the Websites.</p>
<p><strong>What are clear gifs?</strong> Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the full-stop or period at the end of this sentence.</p>
<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites. As part of their service, they use cookies and clear gifs. We will not provide any third-party ad server with any of your Personally Identifiable Information or information about your purchases. We and our third party ad server will collect and use your IP address and certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information about you, such as your browser type, the server your computer is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your server and whether you responded to a particular advertisement. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/" target="_blank">clicking here</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Flash cookie?</strong> Local storage objects, also known as “Flash cookies”, are similar in function to browser cookies in that they store some information about you or your activities on our Websites. We use Flash cookies in certain situations where we use Flash to provide some content such as video clips or animation. The options within your browser may not prevent the setting of Flash cookies. To manage Flash cookies please click here: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</a>.</p>
