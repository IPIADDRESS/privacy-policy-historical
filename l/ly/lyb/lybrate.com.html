		<strong class="capitalize">A. What personally identifiable information is collected from You through this Site.</strong><br>
		<ol class="nested">
		  <li class="nested mfirst">
			<strong>Information collection and use</strong><br>
		    Lybrate is the sole owner of the information collected on this Site. We will not sell, share, transfer or 
			rent any personal information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement and 
			the Terms of Use. Lybrate collects information from You on the Sign Up and Registration pages ("Profile 
			pages") on our Site. Lybrate reserves the right to collect, disseminate, sell or otherwise disclose nonpersonal information provided by You.	
		  </li>
		  <li class="nested mfirst">
			<strong>Registration</strong><br>
		    During the collection of information at the Sign Up pages on the Site, You are required to give your 
			contact information (such as name, physician license information, e-mail address and the like). A 
			mobile verification code and Registration Number is used to confirm Your identity. An email address is 
			also used to contact You about the materials and information on the Site. When the Site requests Your 
			identity, the Site will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. All 
			of your professional information will be authenticated against a third party provider.
		  </li>
		  <li class="nested mfirst">
			<strong>Personal Profile</strong><br>
		    Once a registered participant, You may provide additional information in Your personal profile 
			describing your credentials, professional experiences, academic background, biography and the like. 
			Your personal profile shall be available for viewing by other registered participants of Lybrate and will 
			be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. Providing additional information in Your personal 
			profile beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional and can be altered or removed by 
			You at any time.
		  </li>
		  <li class="nested mfirst">
			<strong>IP Addresses</strong><br>
		    Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as 
			that computer's Internet Protocol or "IP" address. When You request a page from any page within the 
			Site, our Web servers automatically recognize Your domain name and IP address. The domain name 
			and IP address reveal nothing personal about You other than the IP address from which You have 
			accessed the Site.
		  </li>	
		  <li class="nested mfirst">
			<strong>Third Party Email Addresses</strong><br>
		    For the purposes of inviting and introducing third parties to Lybrate, You will be given the option to 
			import or otherwise provide email addresses of third parties to Lybrate. On so doing, Lybrate will not 
			store your username or affiliated password.
		  </li>	
		  <li class="nested mfirst">
			<strong>Children's and Minor's Privacy</strong><br>
		    Lybrate strongly encourages parents and guardians to supervise the online activities of their minor 
			children and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software 
			manufacturers to help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools also can prevent minors
			from disclosing their name, address, and other personally identifiable information online without 
			parental permission. Although the Site is not intended for use by minors, Lybrate respects the privacy 
			of minors who may inadvertently use the Internet.
		  </li>	
		  <li class="nested mfirst">
			<strong>Opt Out Procedures</strong><br>
		    Upon initial communication from Lybrate, You may opt-out of receiving further communications from 
			Lybrate. To be completely removed from the Lybrate mailing list, You may 
			contact <a href="mailto:hello@lybrate.com">hello@lybrate.com</a>. If You are using an e-mail forwarding service or other similar service 
			please make sure to include the correct e-mail address or addresses.
		  </li>
		</ol>
		<strong class="capitalize">b. how the information is used</strong><br>
		<ol class="nested">
		   <li class="nested mfirst">
			<strong>Use of Personal Health Information</strong><br>
		    Lybrate does not collect personal health information about individuals. Lybrate does not collect or 
			maintain information that would associate this submission with a specific patient or individual. The 
			Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) privacy rule, which took effect on 
			April 14, 2003, allows for the use of de-identified health information so long as identifiers have been 
			"stripped" and a key is not disclosed that would allow the information to be re-identified. Lybrate does 
			not possess a key to re-identify patient data.
		  </li>
		   <li class="nested mfirst">
			<strong>Sale of Assets, Merger, Acquisition, Bankruptcy</strong><br>
		    Information collected from You may be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale or acquisition, 
			merger or bankruptcy involving Lybrate.
		  </li>	
		   <li class="nested mfirst">
			<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
		    A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to Your browser from a Web server and stored on Your 
			computer's hard drive. A cookie cannot read data off Your hard disk or read cookie files created by 
			other sites. Use of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on the 
			Site. Once You close Your browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on 
			Your browser, You would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on 
			the Site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of Your browser. You can 
			reset your browser to refuse all cookies or allow Your browser to show You when a cookie is being sent.
			If You reject the cookies on the Site, You may still be able to use the Site, but it shall be limited to 
			certain minimal functionality. The only drawback to this is that the user may be limited in some areas 
			of our Site or limited to certain functions of the Site. Some of our business partners may use cookies on
			our Site. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. Lybrate and our business 
			partners may use cookies to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that You see on 
			the Site.
