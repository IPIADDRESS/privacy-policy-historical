<h2 class="heading-3">i. Personal Data You Provide to Us</h2>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">We receive and store any information you enter on the Services or provide to us in any other way. The types of personal data collected include your full name, email address, IP address, browser information, username, password, home and billing address, shipping address, credit card information and any other information necessary for us to provide the Services, including the usernames and passwords for your accounts and profiles on third-party sites with which the Services interoperates. You may also choose to provide us with a profile photo.</p>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">We use the information we collect from you to provide the Services to you and improve the Services and the Content. The personal data you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, developing new products, completing transactions on your behalf, protecting Lyst and our users and communicating with you about Lyst’s products and services, including special and new features.</p>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">We also use the information we collect to send you product news and updates (such as when items or brands you have told us that you following or are interested in become available), newsletters, marketing materials and other information that may be of interest to you. For example, depending on your email notification settings, we may send you instant, daily or weekly "sale alert" updates that include new products you may like. You can decide to stop getting these updates by updating your account settings (or through other settings we may provide).</p>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">We will collect details of transactions you carry out through our Services and of the fulfilment of your orders.  Saved card details will never be shared with third parties unless we need to in order to process your order, and only using our secure systems. These details will be fully encrypted and only used to process card transactions which you have initiated. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that third party business partners' to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of that personal data.</p>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</p>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features (see section 9 below for further information on the choices you have).</p>

<h2 class="heading-3">ii. Personal data Collected Automatically</h2>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">a. We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use another feature of our Service. Lyst automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information (please see our <a href="/help/cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a> for further information, and the page you requested.</p>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">b. More generally, our Services automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Services and its components, similar to user music preference data or to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Lyst only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Services or another feature of the Content so that we can make the Services appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve the Content. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Content. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our Content, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Lyst never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, unless it needs to in order to complete a transaction on your behalf. Lyst only discloses information to third parties it trusts.</p>

<h2 class="heading-3">iii. E-mail Communications</h2>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Lyst if your computer supports this type of program. Lyst uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.</p>

<h2 class="heading-3">iv. Mobile Apps</h2>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">When you download or use apps created by Lyst or its affiliates or subsidiaries and, where applicable, have requested or consented to location services, we may receive information about your mobile device and your location, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with personalised content and location-based services, such as search results. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services.  To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</p>

<h2 class="heading-3">3. What About Cookies?</h2>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">Please see our <a href="/help/cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a> for information as to how we use cookies in relation to our Services.</p>

<h2 class="heading-3">4. Where Will We Store Your Personal Data?</h2>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed and use by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or by one of our suppliers.  Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your request, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.  We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">All information you provide to us is hosted and stored on Amazon Web Services cloud-based services (for further information on the measures taken by Amazon to protect the security of their servers and your personal data, please see: http://aws.amazon.com/security/).  If you are not satisfied with the levels of security offered by our cloud provider, you should restrict the nature and amount of personal data or confidential information which you include in your log data or not use the Services. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.   Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.  You must not to share a password with anyone.</p>

<h2 class="heading-3">5. Will Lyst Share Any Of The Personal Data It Receives?</h2>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">Personal data about our customers is an integral part of our business. We neither licence nor sell your personal data to anyone. We share your personal data only as described in this Policy.</p>

<h2 class="heading-3">i. Lyst Partner Websites We Do Not Control</h2>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">Lyst works with a variety of merchants (“Lyst Partners”) in order to offer you the widest possible choice of fashion items through the services.  We promote and sell the items offered by the Lyst Partners through the Services.  When you choose to buy an item, you may be taken directly to their online store. You can easily recognise when a third-party business is associated with your transaction, and we will share your personal data that is related to such transactions with that business. Please note that: (i) the third-party business will use and share your personal data in accordance with its privacy policy; (ii) you should check its policy before completing any transaction involving such third-party business; and (iii) such third-party business is solely responsible for its use and sharing of your personal data.</p>

<h2 class="heading-3">ii. Stripe</h2>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">We use a third party payment process provider called Stripe to process certain credit card and debit card transactions you make through the Services via our Integrated Checkout service (please see section 5(ix) below).  Please note that we will share your personal data with Stripe that it is related to such transactions and Stripe may collect personal data from you directly via cookies or other means in order to process such transactions. Stripe does not sell or rent your personal Information to marketers or third parties. Please note that Stripe may transfer, process and store your personal data that it collects outside of EU member states.  Stripe has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles agreed upon by the U.S. and the E.U. The Safe Harbor certification for Stripe, Inc. can be viewed on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Web Site.  Your personal data may be subject to disclosure by Stripe as required by applicable law.  You can find out more about how Stripe collects and uses your personal data by clicking https://stripe.com/gb/privacy if you are a UK customer or https://stripe.com/us/privacy if you are a US customer, or by selecting the relevant privacy policy for your country by following these links.  By using the Services and making payments through the Services, you are agreeing to Stripe's use of your personal data in accordance with their privacy policy.</p>

<h2 class="heading-3">iii. Other Third Parties</h2>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">We may share your personal data with selected third parties including advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others. We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.</p>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">We may also share your personal data to analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our site. We have implemented the Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting feature. Click <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/">here</a> for information on opting out of Google Analytics features.</p>

<h2 class="heading-3">iv. Agents</h2>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, Lyst’s agents do not have any right to use personal data we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>

<h2 class="heading-3">v. User Profiles and Other Information You Post</h2>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">User profile information including your username, name, email address, and other information you enter (“User Submissions”) may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services and allow you to follow other users, and them to follow you. Email addresses are used to add new User Submissions to user profiles and to communicate through User Submissions. Any personal data or content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, through reviews in product pages, etc.), as well as the items and "Lysts" you compile on the Services, become publicly available and can be viewed, collected and used by others. Any images, captions, physical descriptions, personal interests or other content that you submit to the Services may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.</p>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post information to public areas on the Services or any other public forums, such information can be accessed by the public.</p>

<h2 class="heading-3">vi. Communication in Response to User Submissions</h2>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">As part of the Services, you will receive from Lyst email and other communication relating to your User Submissions. You acknowledge and agree that by posting such User Submissions, Lyst may send you email and other communication that it determines in its sole discretion relate to your User Submissions. Lyst may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your Lyst account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.</p>

<h2 class="heading-3">vii. Business Transfers</h2>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Lyst, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Lyst goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred to or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Lyst may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h2 class="heading-3">viii. Protection of Lyst and Others and a Transfer in the Ownership of Lyst</h2>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">We may release personal data when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law, regulation or legal request; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Lyst, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. You agree that we may also share your data with entities where Lyst is engaged in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy.</p>

<h2 class="heading-3">ix. Integrated Checkout</h2>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">We allow you to purchase items from different multiple different Lyst Partners via the Services through our Integrated Checkout service. Lyst Partners that are part of our Integrated Checkout marketplace (please see the <a href="/help/terms-and-conditions/">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> for more information on the Integrated Checkout service) promote and market their items to you through the Services.</p>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">When you make a purchase through our Integrated Checkout services, we will share your personal data that is related to such transactions with the relevant Lyst Partner from whom you have purchased the item(s), but only using our secure systems. These details will be encrypted and used to process card transactions which you have initiated and may be used by the Lyst Partner, along with other personal data, as set forth in such Lyst Partners’ privacy policies for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, for keeping you up to date with their latest products, developments, and trends. We require the Lyst Partners to honor your opt-out requests if you elect to stop receiving these marketing e-mails. Please be advised that you cannot opt-out of receiving emails related to your transactions. If, for whatever reason, a Lyst Partner does not honor your opt-out request, please let us know and we will attempt to resolve the issues. Again, these Lyst Partners are solely responsible for their use and sharing of your personal data, and you should carefully review their privacy policies before completing a transaction on our Integrated Marketplace.</p>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">We may also share your data with Lyst Partners in connection with certain promotions and competitions.  These will be subject to additional rules and conditions which will be made available at the time of any such competition or promotion. You should carefully review the rules and conditions relating to such competitions and promotions.</p>

<h2 class="heading-3">x. With Your Consent</h2>

You need to ensure that there is no unauthorised access to your account and personal data by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your password. Lyst encourages you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. Lyst cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.</p>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Lyst endeavors to protect personal data but Lyst cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Services. Unauthorised entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our platform; any transmission of data is at your own risk.  Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">The Services contain links to other sites. Lyst is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site you should read the privacy policy stated on that site. This Policy only governs information collected on the Services.</p>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">We will take care to maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided us with. We encrypt your information to protect it from unauthorised use. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that third party business partners' to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of that personal data.</p>
<p class="text-paragraph mt0 mb15">To help ensure that your shopping experience is safe, simple, and secure, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p>

We may also use your data to provide you with information about products and services which may be of interest to you, directly or on behalf of one of our business partners. You can however change the type and frequency of the emails you receive from us at any time by changing your email settings here or by unsubscribing from such emails.</p>
