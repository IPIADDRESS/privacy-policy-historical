Information Collected</b></p><p>This privacy policy applies only to information collected on the Sites and does not apply to information collected by RB through any other means.</p><p>We collect two types of information from visitors to the Sites: (1) Personally Identifiable Information; and (2) Non- Personally Identifiable Information, such as your IP address or cookies.</p><p>(1) Personally Identifiable Information</p><p>"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, or company name. RB collects and stores the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us on the Sites, including as follows::</p><p>We may collect your first and last name and product or service details if you contact us with a question related to our products or services;&nbsp;We may collect your first and last name, mailing address and billing information if you purchase a product or service on the Sites;&nbsp;We may collect registration details about a product that you purchase from RB and this information may be tied to your name and mailing address;&nbsp;We may collect your first and last name, mailing information, email address and billing information if you download information from a Site;&nbsp;We may collect your name, email address or phone number if you contact us with a question; We may collect your first and last name, date of birth and email address if you choose to participate in a contest or sweepstakes; and/or&nbsp;We may collect your name and mobile phone number if you consent to receive autodialed and/or pre-recorded telemarketing messages from or on behalf of us at your mobile number. If you do not want RB to collect your personally identifiable information, please do not provide it to us.</p><p>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p><p>"Non-Personally Identifiable Information" can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, location, gender or interests. Non-personally identifiable information does NOT identify you personally. Here are some examples of the non-personally identifiable information that is collected via the Sites:</p><p>Internet Protocol (IP) address -- Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the webpages you view.</p><p>Cookie -- A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on the Sites. For example, when someone visits a page within the Sites, a cookie is placed on the user's machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the Sites previously. Cookies may also be used to track users across the Web. We use the information we collect from cookies for marketing and product planning purposes. Collected data may also be shared, in aggregate form, with third-parties (e.g., dealers, marketers, distributors, Shopify, and Google Analytics). We do not currently honor any “do-not-track” signal sent by browsers. However, you may opt-out of targeted advertising from National Advertising Initiative members by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. You may also set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users to our Sites. Additionally, some of the cookies we use may be flash cookies or Adobe cookies. While they are harmless, they may contain non-personally identifiable information and depending on your browser these cookies may not normally be deleted when your cookies are deleted. Please check your browser to determine where these types of cookies are stored and how they may be deleted.</p><p>Some cookies may, when combined with other information, constitute Personally Identifiable Information. These cookies are subject to the same protections found in this Privacy Policy. You can find more information about our use of cookies in our Cookie Policy.</p><p>Cookies -- Third-Party Online Advertising. To understand your interests and deliver advertisements that are tailored to your interests, we may work with third parties that use their own cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect Information about Site Visitors’ online activities, either on our Sites and/or other websites across the Internet. These third parties include advertisers and ad networks that may collect information about when you view or interact with one of their advertisements and may collect information regarding your activities on our Sites and your online activities over time and across different websites. Like most advertisers, we work to place our advertisements where we think they will be most interesting and relevant to the recipient. One way we do this is by allowing ad networks to place their own cookies when an individual visits our Sites. This enables the ad network to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Sites. Then, if the ad network has purchased ad space on a third-party website, and recognizes that same individual visiting that third-party website, the ad network can deliver one of our advertisements, knowing that this individual has already expressed interest in our Sites, products, and/or services by visiting our Sites. To learn more about third parties who collect Site Visitor Information, please review our Cookie Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Web Beacons (also known as "clear gifs," "web bugs" or "pixel tags") -- "Web Beacons" are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Sites and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages.</p><p>Product Information -- We may collect registration information or other details about your product or service. Unless this information is tied to your name or address, it is not considered personally identifiable. We may collect the above non-personally identifiable information from all visitors to our Sites. If you do not want RB to have access to this information, please do not visit our Sites.</p><p><b>B. Use of Information Collected Via the Sites</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(1) Personally Identifiable Information</p><p>We use your personally identifiable information that is collected on these Sites primarily for the following purposes:</p><p>To deliver services; To alert you to special offers, updated information and other new products or services from RB, or other third parties, or to forward promotional materials to you (subject to your right to opt out of receiving such alerts or promotional materials as outlined in Section G below); To complete a transaction or service requested by you; To ensure the Sites are relevant to your needs; To help us create and publish content most relevant to you; To notify you about a material change to this privacy policy or our Terms of Use, if necessary; To allow you access to limited-entry areas of the Sites; and To contact you in response to sign up forms such as Contact Us or other inquiry. In addition, if you email us a question, we may use your email address to process your request and respond to your question. Also, if you are entering a sweepstakes or contest, we may use your personally identifiable information in order to fulfill the terms of that promotion.</p><p>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p><p>Non-personally identifiable information is used as described above and in other ways as permitted by applicable laws, including combining non-personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information.</p><p><b>C. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</b></p><p>(1) Personally Identifiable Information</p><p>We may share or disclose your personally identifiable information in the following instances:</p><p>To our parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates in order to better serve you. RB may have to share your data with these parties in order to provide you with services that have been requested by you, or so that we can ensure our services and products are meeting your needs.</p><p>To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or independent contractors who help us maintain our Sites and provide other administrative services to us (including, but not limited to, order processing and fulfillment, providing customer service, maintaining and analyzing data, sending customer communications on RB's behalf, and entry collection, winner selection and prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes and other promotions). We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties will not use the personally identifiable information for any other purpose than to provide the administrative services for which they are responsible. Because such unaffiliated third-party service providers that help us administer our Sites will have access to users' personally identifiable information, if you do not wish for our unaffiliated third-party service providers to have access to your information, please do not register or submit any personally identifiable information to us.</p><p>To complete your purchase. If you choose to make a purchase on the Sites, we may collect from you your credit card number, billing address and other information related to such purchase, and we may use such collected information in order to fulfill your purchase. We may also provide such information, or other personally identifiable information provided by you, to unaffiliated third parties as necessary to complete your purchase (for example, to process your credit card).</p><p>To comply with the law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the requirements of law or comply with legal process or other government requests served on us (including in response to lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), protect and defend our rights or property, including the rights and property of RB, or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our end users.</p><p>To third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.</p><p>To track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.</p><p>To protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information collected from these Sites. In the course of such verification, we may receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit card or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.</p><p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy or at the time we request the information, we do not otherwise use, share or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information to any third parties.</p><p>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p><p>We use non-personally identifiable information collected on the Sites in the manner disclosed above, in the Section A (2). We may share this non-personal information with our fulfilment partners for research and statistical purposes.</p><p><b>D. Google Analytics</b></p><p>Our Sites use Google Analytics, a web analytic service provided by Google, Inc.

Tags are small code elements that, among other things, are used to measure traffic and visitor behavior; to understand the effect of online advertising and social channels; to set up remarketing and orientation towards target groups; and to test and optimize websites. GTM makes it easier for us to integrate and manage our tags.&nbsp;We use GTM on our Sites to include the Google Analytics tracking tool.&nbsp;</p><p><b>E. Collection and Use of Information from Children Under the Age of 13</b></p><p>RB does not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use the Sites.
