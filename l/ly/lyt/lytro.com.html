    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h4 class="subNote">(effective October 19, 2011)</h4>
    <p>Lytro, Inc. ("<span class="bold">Lytro,</span>" "<span class="bold">we</span>" or "<span class="bold">us</span>") continually strives to improve the experience of using Lytro products and services and to offer compelling and innovative ways to take and experience pictures. These are the primary goals in collecting information from our customers and web and mobile visitors ("<span class="bold">you</span>").</p>
    <p>This policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose information we receive from you. We may update it from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new policy and a redline of the changes on our website.</p>


    <p class="title">Information We Collect</p>
    <p>Information about you that can be used to contact or identify you, or that can be used to identify you when combined with other information, is "personally identifiable information." Some of the information that we collect from you is personally identifiable information, and some isn’t.</p>
    <p class="italic">Lytro.com</p>
    <p>Upon reserving a Lytro camera, you give us your email address. When you purchase a Lytro camera from Lytro.com, you provide information including your name, email, phone number, shipping and credit card information, and other information you affirmatively provide. We record the serial number of the Lytro camera that has been shipped to the purchaser. When you register as a user of Lytro.com, you provide your name and email address and create a password and a public username. If you elect to register via a social media platform such as Facebook, we will request your name, email, and username from such platform and will prefill them for you on Lytro.com, but you can change them on Lytro.com. When you register via Facebook, we automatically associate your Lytro.com account with your Facebook account to facilitate your logging in on Lytro.com. You may disassociate the accounts by changing your Lytro.com settings to remove your Facebook account or by removing Lytro from your list of applications on Facebook.</p>
    <p>If you are a registered user, you may upload pictures on Lytro.com as "public" or "unlisted." Public pictures can be viewed and shared by all Lytro.com visitors and users and are searchable on Lytro.com and by third-party search engines such as Google. Unlisted pictures can be viewed and shared by the user who uploaded them and by others who know the link to the pictures. The recipients of a link from the user can further forward it or publicly post it. Anyone who knows the link is able to access the unlisted pictures on Lytro.com and can further "like" or share them on third-party sites such as Facebook. Unlisted pictures exposed in this way may show up in search indices and become easily discoverable by people who do not have the link to them. As such, the privacy of unlisted pictures is not in our control, and users should take reasonable precautions with posting and sharing their pictures.</p>
    <p>Pictures taken with the Lytro camera may contain metadata such as camera settings, caption, and the camera’s serial number. When you upload pictures to Lytro.com, this data is transmitted to us and may be available to viewers of the pictures.</p>
    <p>When you delete your pictures from Lytro.com, we will remove them from your account view as soon as possible, and in any event within 48 hours unless there are unforeseen circumstances. Residual copies may remain on our servers for up to 90 days. After such period, we may retain copies only if we are required by law, regulation or legal process.</p>
    <p>Your comments on Lytro.com display your profile picture (if available) and user name or name.  Comments to public pictures and in other public areas on our website are public and searchable on Lytro.com and by third-party search engines such as Google. Comments to unlisted pictures can be viewed by Lytro.com visitors with a link to the pictures. We treat deleted comments and comments to deleted pictures the same way we treat deleted pictures.</p>
    <p>When you visit our website, certain information is automatically recorded.  Generally, we use this information in an aggregated and anonymized way. If we need to combine it with personally identifiable information, we treat it as such. Automatically collected information includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Statistical or technical information such as, for example, your computer’s Internet Protocol address, operating system and browser type, time and date, and how you navigate through and interact with the website.
      </li>
      <li>
        Information collected via "cookies," which are small data files that we transfer to your computer for record-keeping purposes. We primarily use cookies for login session management.  You can change the options on your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before&nbsp;accepting a cookie from a website.  If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or functionality of our website.
      </li>
      <li>
        We use third parties to collect anonymized and aggregated demographic and website use information such as, for example, type of browser and operating system, location, Internet service provider (or, in the case of mobile devices, mobile carrier, UDID), and type of device.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We use Adobe Flash shared object (commonly known as "Flash cookies") to assist our visitors with seeing new features and to facilitate the use of Flash player on our website. We do not collect information back from Flash cookies. You can manage Flash cookies by using Adobe’s tool found <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p class="italic">Lytro Desktop Application</p>
    <p>We collect the following data through the Lytro desktop application:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>technical and statistical data about the usage of the Lytro desktop application and on-camera software;</li>
      <li>technical information about the Lytro camera such as serial number, firmware version, and product version; and</li>
      <li>technical information about your computer such as hardware specifications and operating system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="italic">Emails and Other Communications</p>
    <p>From time to time, we send marketing or research emails. They may contain "beacons," which are small images that inform us about recipients’ receptiveness to our emails. Our third-party mail service provider also provides us with anonymized and aggregated demographic information about the respondents to our emails. In our emails, we may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with additional information about you. Generally, we use information from our marketing and research communications in an aggregated and anonymized way. When our business needs require, we combine it with personally identifiable information, and in such cases we treat it as such.  You can unsubscribe from our marketing and research emails by following the instructions included in them.</p>
    <p>We may also communicate with you about your order or account, or to address your questions.</p>
    <p class="italic">Social Media</p>
    <p>We have a presence on various social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.  We receive from them anonymized and aggregated demographic and use information related to our presence on the respective social media platform.</p>


    <p class="title">How We Use This Information</p>
    <p>We continually strive to improve the experience of using Lytro products and services and to offer compelling and innovative ways to take and experience pictures. These are the primary goals in collecting information from our customers, users and visitors.</p>
    <p>We use collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>complete our transactions with you and keep a record of our dealings with you;</li>
      <li>offer, facilitate, personalize, and improve our products and services;</li>
      <li>provide you customer support;</li>
      <li>perform quality assurance and business analyses;</li>
      <li>communicate with you about our products and services;</li>
      <li>better understand your Lytro experience and your needs and interests;</li>
      <li>develop new products and services; and</li>
      <li>comply with legal process and for enforcement purposes as described below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may combine information we collect through our website with information we collect from other Lytro sources and from third parties.</p>


    <p class="title">Information Sharing and Disclosure</p>
    <p>In our ordinary course of business, we do not sell or provide your information to unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. We may share information in the following circumstances:</p>
    <p class="italic">Service Providers and Partners</p>
    <p>We may employ or partner with third parties to facilitate our services or provide them on our behalf, to perform website-related services (for example, data storage, maintenance, database management, web analytics and improvement of our website’s features), to integrate their services with ours (such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.), to assist us in communicating with you, or to assist us in analyzing how our website and services are used.  These third parties have access to your information solely for the purpose of performing these respective tasks.</p>
    <p class="italic">Affiliated Parties</p>
    <p>We may share your information with our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or business partners with whom we jointly offer products and services.</p>
    <p class="italic">Compliance with Legal Requirements; Enforcement
    </p><p>We also may disclose your information if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with any law, regulation, legal process, administrative or other government proceeding, (2) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our website, products, or services, (3) prevent and address fraud or technical issues; (4) enforce our rights, policies and agreements or defend ourselves in legal or government proceedings; or (5) protect our and our customers’ rights, property, and safety.</p>
    <p class="italic">Business Transactions</p>
    <p>We may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including your information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or if we dissolve, reorganize our business, or cease operating as a going concern (for example, in the event of a bankruptcy).</p>


    <p class="title">Security</p>
    <p>Safeguarding your information is important to us.  We employ reasonable measures designed to protect personally identifiable information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. These measures include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>performing internal and external review of security measures and practices;</li>
      <li>implementing industry-recognized security safeguards such as encryption of data transmitted over the Internet and use of "secure cookies";</li>
      <li>using PCI-compliant vendors for processing credit card payments;</li>
      <li>anonymizing and aggregating data when business needs permit; and</li>
      <li>entering into confidentiality agreements with employees and service providers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While we are striving to protect your information, there are no impenetrable security measures. We cannot guarantee the protection of information from accident, interception, or misappropriation.</p>


    <p class="title">Information from Children</p>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.  If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@lytro.com">legal@lytro.com</a>.  If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such information from our files.</p>


    <p class="title">Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites</p>
    <p>Our website may contain links to or integrations with other sites such as social media websites, community feedback platforms, etc., whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is collected by these third parties.</p>


    <p class="title">Contacting Us</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@lytro.com">legal@lytro.com</a> or by writing to Privacy Officer, c/o Lytro, Inc., 1300 Terra Bella Avenue, Mountain View, CA 94043-1820.</p>
