<b><u>VISITOR AGREEMENT</u></b>
<br><br>
Welcome to <b>International Lyrics Playground</b>. Please read this visitor
agreement; by using this service, you accept its terms.  
<br><br>                    
The Web is an evolving medium; we may change the terms of this agreement
from time to time. By continuing to use the service after we post any such
changes, you accept this agreement, as modified.

<u><b>Privacy</b></u>
<br><br>
<u>The Information We Collect</u>
<br><br>
The information gathered through this website falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our website through optional registration or e-commerce transactions, and (2) tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through our site. Third party service providers on or linked to by our website, such as vendors of products and services offered through our site, may be gathering information, as well.
<br><br>                    
International Lyrics Playground respects the privacy of our users. Under no circumstances will International Lyrics Playground, it's host or it's owners ever willfully divulge user information to any third parties. This includes user/viewer email address or any other personally identifiable information.
<br><br> 
<u>Cookies</u>
<br><br>
To help make our site more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we invoke a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique number, a sort of user ID, if you will, that resides on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can't read unrelated data off your hard drive. Our advertisers and third party service providers may also assign their own cookies to your browser, a process that we don't control.
<br><br>
<u>Browser level information</u>
<br><br>
Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer configuration when you visit our site, including the type of browser software you use and your IP address. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our site.
<br><br>
<u>Information Collected By Third Parties</u>
<br><br>
We may use a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our website. Advertiser does not use your name, address, email address, or phone number to deliver Internet ads. Advertiser does use information about your browser and Web surfing to determine which ads to show you.
