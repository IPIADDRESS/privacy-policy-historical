geographicals reports. Google Analytics processes all data in an aggregated and anonymous form that

The Service does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Service and after you leave our Service. We collect certain persistent identifiers from your browser or mobile device to assist us with providing and improving the Service. Because we collect browsing and persistent identifier data (only for analytic and internal purposes), your selection of the "Do Not Track" option provided by your mobile browser will not have any effect on our collection of analytics information or the collection of a persistent identifier.</li>

The GDPR states that IP addresses should be considered personal data as it enters the scope of \x91online identifiers'. Of course, in the case of a dynamic IP address \x96 which is changed every time a person connects to a network \x96 there has been some legitimate debate going on as to whether it can truly lead to the identification of a person or not. The conclusion is that the GDPR does consider it as such. The logic behind this decision is relatively simple. The internet service provider (ISP) has a record of the temporary dynamic IP address and knows to whom it has been assigned. A website provider has a record of the web pages accessed by a dynamic IP address (but no other data that would lead to the identification of the person). If the two pieces information would be combined, the website provider could find the identity of the person behind a certain dynamic IP address. However, the chances of this happening are small, as the ISP has to meet certain legal obligations before it can hand the data to a website provider. The conclusion is, all IP addresses should be treated as personal data, in order to be GDPR compliant."});
