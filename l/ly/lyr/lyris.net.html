</ul>
<h5>6. Legal Basis for Processing your Personal Data (EEA and Switzerland only)</h5>
<p>With respect to personal data collected from individuals from the European Economic Area or Switzerland, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. Aurea will generally collect personal data from you only where: (a) we have your consent to do so, (b) where we need the personal data to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the services you have requested), or (c) where the processing is in our or a third party‚Äôs legitimate interests (and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms).</p>
<h5>7. Limiting Use, Disclosure, Retention</h5>
<p>Whenever applicable, Aurea identifies the purposes for which the information is being collected before or at the time of collection. The collection of your personal data will be limited to that which is needed for the purposes identified by Aurea. Unless you consent, or we are required by law, we will only use the personal data for the purposes for which it was collected. If Aurea will be processing your personal data for another purpose later on, Aurea will seek your further legal permission or consent; except where the other purpose is compatible with the original purpose. We will keep your personal data only as long as required to serve those purposes. We will also retain and use your personal data for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements</p>
<h5>8.&nbsp;International Transfers of your Personal data</h5>
<p>Aurea is a global company. Information about you may be stored and processed in the European Economic Area, the United States or any other country in which Aurea or agents or contractors maintain facilities, and by accessing our websites and using our mobile apps, software and services, you consent to the transfer of your information outside of your country. Such countries may have laws which are different and potentially not as protective as the laws of your own country.</p>
<p>Whenever we share personal data originating in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, we will rely on lawful measures to transfer that data, such as the Privacy Shield or the EU standard contractual clauses. If you reside in the EEA or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal data to the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. By providing your personal data, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<h5><strong> 9. Accuracy of Personal data</strong></h5>
<p>We do our best to ensure that the personal data we hold and use is accurate. We rely on the customers we do business with to disclose to us all relevant information and to inform us of any changes.</p>
<h5>10. Your Access to and Updating of your Personal data</h5>
<p>Reasonable access to your personal data may be provided upon request made to Aurea at the contact information provided below. If access cannot be provided within that time frame, Aurea will provide the requesting party a date when the information will be provided. If for some reason access is denied, we will provide an explanation as to why access has been denied. We may charge a reasonable fee in advance for copying and sending the information requested.</p>
<p>If you would like us to delete any personal Data held about you, we will do so on request unless we need to hold the information as part of the provision of products and services to you.</p>
<h5>11. Marketing Communications</h5>
<p>We offer those who provide personal contact information a means to choose how we use the information provided. You may manage your receipt of marketing and non- transactional communications by clicking on the ‚Äúunsubscribe‚Äù link located on the bottom of our marketing emails.</p>
<h5>12. Additional Rights (EEA and Switzerland only)</h5>
<p>If you reside in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, you may have the right to exercise additional rights available to you under applicable laws, including:</p>
<ul class="default">
<li><strong>Right of erasure.</strong> You may have a broader right to erasure of personal data that we hold about you. For example, if it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was originally collected. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations, among other things.</li>
<li><strong>Right to object to processing.</strong> You may have the right to request that we stop processing your personal data or to stop sending you marketing communications.</li>
<li><strong>Right to restrict processing.</strong> You may have the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. For example, where you believe that the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate or unlawfully held.</li>
<li><strong>Right to data portability.</strong>&nbsp;In certain circumstances, you may have the right to be provided with your personal data in a structured, machine readable and commonly used format and to request that we transfer the personal data to another data controller without hindrance.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to exercise any of the above rights, please contact our support team or contact our Data Protection Officer (see our contact details in Section 17 below). We will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws. To protect your privacy and security, we may take steps to verify your identity before complying with the request.</p>
<p>You may also have the right to make a GDPR complaint to the relevant Supervisory Authority. A list of Supervisory Authorities is available here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>. If you need further assistance regarding your rights, please contact us using the contact information provided below and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable law. In some cases, our ability to uphold these rights for you may depend upon our obligations to process personal data for security, safety, fraud prevention reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or because processing is necessary to deliver the services you have requested. Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.</p>
<h5>13. Notice to End Users</h5>
<p>Most of our services are intended for use by organizations. Where the services are made available to you through an organization (e.g. your employer), that organization is the administrator of the services and is responsible for the accounts and/or service over which it has control. Please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the services is subject to that organization‚Äôs policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator‚Äôs organization, which may be different than this policy.</p>

<li>allow you to reset your account password;</li>

If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us immediately.</p>
<h5>15. Your California Privacy Rights (United States only)</h5>

<h5>B). Principles</h5>
<p>The Aurea U.S. Corporate Group may receive Personal Data from its own personnel as well as from its affiliates, resellers, customers, end-users and other parties located in the EEA or Switzerland.</p>
<p>Such information may contain, but is not limited to name (first and last name), position,&nbsp; address, email address, phone number, login credentials, human resources data and transaction information and may be about customers, clients of customers, business partners, acquisition targets, potential buyers consultants, employees, and candidates for employment and includes information recorded on various media as well as electronic data.

<p>The Aurea U.S. Corporate Group is the controller of its own human resources data. In addition, the Aurea U.S. Corporate Group acting as a data processor or sub-processor may receive Personal Data via its customers. The Aurea U.S. Corporate Group executes data processing agreements with such customers which set out the parties‚Äô obligations and responsibilities to comply with the Principles. The COMPANY U. S. Corporate Group will cooperate with its customers to enable them to comply with the Principles.</p>
<p>Whenever the Aurea U.S. Corporate Group processes Personal Data, the Aurea U.S. Corporate Group complies with the Principles (as each Principle is applicable to the Aurea U.S. Corporate Group‚Äôs role):</p>
<ol class="default">
<li>
<p><strong>Notice.&nbsp;</strong>Whenever we collect Personal Data directly from individuals, we shall inform an individual of the purpose for which we collect and use their Personal Data and the types of third parties to which the Aurea U.S. Corporate Group discloses or may disclose that Personal Data. Please refer to our main <strong>Privacy Policy Statement</strong> for more information regarding our data handling practices.&nbsp; The Aurea U.S. Corporate Group shall provide the individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Data. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Data to the Aurea U.S. Corporate Group, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before the Aurea U.S. Corporate Group uses or discloses the Personal Data for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected. The Aurea U.S. Corporate Group may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choice.</strong> Whenever we collect Personal Data directly from individuals for marketing purposes, those individuals have the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their Personal Data is (1) to be disclosed to a third party or (2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual by contacting our Data Protection Officer via email at privacy@aurea.com. For Sensitive Personal Information, The Aurea U.S. Corporate Group will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively or explicitly (opt in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-Agent third party or for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. We shall treat Sensitive Personal Information received from an individual the same as the individual would treat and identify it as Sensitive Personal Information. Agents, technology vendors and contractors of the Aurea U.S. Corporate Group or affiliated companies may have access to an individual‚Äôs Personal Data on a need to know basis for the purpose of performing services on behalf of the Aurea U.S. Corporate Group or providing or enabling elements of the services. All such agents, technology vendors and contractors who have access to such information are contractually required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for the Aurea U.S. Corporate Group or as otherwise required by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accountability for Onward Transfer.</strong> Whenever we collect Personal Data directly from individuals, prior to disclosing Personal Data to a third party, we shall notify the individual of such disclosure and allow the individual the choice (opt out) of such disclosure. We shall ensure that any third party to which Personal Data may be disclosed agrees in writing to provide the same level of privacy protection as set forth in this policy.</p>
<p>The Aurea U.S. Corporate Group‚Äôs accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Aurea U.S. Corporate Group remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Aurea U.S. Corporate Group proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Security.</strong> We shall take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. The Aurea U.S. Corporate Group has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Personal Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.

</li>
<li>

To the extent necessary for those purposes, the Aurea U.S. Corporate Group shall take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access.</strong> We acknowledge the individual‚Äôs right to access their Personal Data. We shall allow an individual access to their Personal Data and allow the individual the opportunity to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. Individuals may contact our Data Protection Officer via email at privacy@aurea..com to request to access, correct, amend, or delete the personal information Aurea U.S. Corporate Group holds about you. In cases where the Aurea U.S. Corporate Group is a Data Sub-Processor or Processor, individuals must contact the Data Processor or the Data Controller, as applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enforcement and Dispute Resolution.</strong> With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, the Aurea U.S. Corporate Group is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. </p>
<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, the Aurea U.S. Corporate Group commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.

</ol>
<p>If your Privacy Shield complaint was not resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See Privacy Shield Annex 1 at <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction</a></p>
<h5>C). Amendments</h5>
<p>This Privacy Statement may be amended from time to time consistent with the requirements of the Shield Frameworks. We will post any revised policy on this website.</p>
<h5>D) Information Subject to Other Policies</h5>
