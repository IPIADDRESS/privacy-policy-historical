                <p>
                    When you visit this Service, certain non-personally identifying information is recorded
                    automatically by the standard operation of our Internet servers. Information such as the type of
                    browser being used, its operating system, and your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a
                    number that your Internet service provider assigns to your computer whenever you surf the Internet)
                    is gathered in order to facilitate our online operations and to assure an efficient online
                    experience for you. If you access our Service from a mobile or other device, we may collect
                    information for that device (including operating system, browser, type of device) in order to
                    facilitate our mobile operations and to assure an efficient mobile experience for you. We may use or
                    share this information for security purposes, to generate group statistics about our user community,
                    or as required by law.

                    information about you from the social network automatically. The information we receive depends on
                    the Service, the social network, and your privacy settings and your friends' privacy settings on
                    that social network.

                    If you access our Service from a social network, you should also read that social network's Terms of

                <p>
                    Among the purposes for which we may use such generally non-personally identifying information is for
                    identification purposes in the event of an emergency threatening life or property, or where proper
                    legal process allows using such information. For instance, we may use your IP address or other
                    automatically recorded information, in cooperation with your Internet provider, to attempt to
                    identify you if it is necessary to contact you or to bring legal action against you because you are
                    violating the Terms of Service for use for this Service, may be causing injury to or interference
                    (intentionally or unintentionally) with our company's rights or property, or may be adversely
                    affecting other users of this Service or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities.

                <p><b>Personal Information You Provide To Us</b></p>
                <p>
                    We may request personally identifying information from you in a variety of contexts. For example,
                    you may provide such data to us if you: (1) complete an online registration form (e.g., registering
                    for an account, various sign-up forms for receiving email newsletters, registering for special
                    offers, entering a contest/sweepstakes or responding to a survey); (2) fill out an order form to
                    request information; (3) register to participate in message boards and chat rooms (if any) and other
                    community features; or (4) purchase any products or services from us or another LyricsMode business.
                    Additionally, when you ask for help from our Customer Support team, we will collect and store the
                    contact information you give them (generally, your name and e-mail address), information about your
                    activity on our Services, and your user name. We will also store the communications you have with
                    the Customer Service team and any information in those communications in order to provide support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In such cases, the personally identifying information we request may include your name, email
                    address, mailing address and zip code, phone number, and, where appropriate, a valid credit card
                    number with expiration date (collectively, "Personal Information"). In addition, we may collect
                    other non-personally identifying information such as your date of birth, gender, country of
                    residence, language preference, hobbies and other information regarding your interaction with our
                    Service such as your viewing and listening habits, preferences and other customized activities in
                    which you participate. Of course, you never have to answer any of the questions we ask you (nor
                    choose to view or listen to any multimedia content or otherwise interact with our Service), but
                    refusal to do so may limit the products or services we can offer or provide to you.

                <p>
                    When you provide Personal Information to us, we may use that data to create a <b>"My Profile"</b>
                    page for you, which will be held in a database using reasonable security measures to protect the
                    data from unauthorized access. Others outside LyricsMode.com will not be allowed to see the data on
                    your <b>My Profile Page</b> except with your consent (see below). If you register to set up an
                    account, you will be able to access your <b>My Profile</b> page at any time in order to update your
                    individual Personal Information listed therein (see below under "How Can You Correct or Review Your

                    transaction (e.g., fulfillment, billing, mailing, storage or delivery services). We will not share
                    your credit card information with any third party unless that company needs the number for the
                    fulfillment or delivery of your order. We do not rent, sell or share credit card information with

                    . To safeguard against unauthorized access to personal information by third parties, all electronic
                    personal information held by LyricsMode is maintained on systems that are protected by up-to-date
                    secure network architectures that contain firewalls and intrusion detection devices. The data saved
                    in servers is "backed up" (i.e. the data are recorded on separate media) to avoid the consequences
                    of any inadvertent erasure, destruction or loss otherwise. The servers are stored in facilities with
                    high security, access restricted to unauthorized personnel, fire detection and response systems.

                    Children under 13 are not allowed to use LyricsMode. If you are based in the EEA you may only use
                    LyricsMode if you are over the age at which you can provide consent to data processing under the
                    laws of your country or if verifiable parental consent for your use of LyricsMode has been provided

                    LyricsMode is a worldwide service. By using LyricsMode, you authorize us to transfer and store your
                    information outside your home country, including in the United States, for the purposes described in
                    this policy. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your information in

                </p>
                <p>
                    We take additional measures when information is transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA).
                    This includes having standard clauses approved by the European Commission in our contracts with
                    parties that receive information outside the EEA. We also rely on European Commission adequacy
                    decisions about certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers to countries outside the EEA.

                <p><b>Cookies</b></p>
                <p>
                    A "cookie" is a small text file that an Internet Service can place on your computer's hard drive for
                    record-keeping purposes. Cookies make using this Service easier by, among other things, saving your
                    passwords and preferences for you, keeping track of your shopping cart when you visit an online
                    store or other similar purposes, and to help identify you whenever you return to our Service, so you
                    do not need to reenter your identification information. Most Internet browsers are initially set up
                    to accept cookies. However, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to alert you when a
                    cookie is being sent (note: you may need to consult your browser's "Help" area for instructions on
                    how to do that). If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie, some
                    parts of this Service will not function properly or may perform considerably slower. For example,
                    without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences or you may have difficulty
                    downloading tablatures, watching videos or utilizing the Community Forums. Some of our web pages may
                    contain electronic images (called "Clear GIFs", "Single-Pixel GIFs", or "Web Beacons") that allow us
                    to count page views or to access cookies. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web
                    page, including an ad banner, can act as a Clear GIF. Typically, though, Clear GIFs are very small
                    (1-by-1 pixel size) files. They are often invisible on a web page, but their presence can be
                    detected within many Internet browsers by setting your browser to view web page "sources". Clear
                    GIFs are so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is better used to
                    display helpful content. We may also include Clear GIFs in our email products in order to determine
                    information about the opening and reading of such emails. In addition, some advertising networks
                    that serve ads on our web Service may occasionally use Clear GIFs within banner advertisements.
                    Clear GIFs set by LyricsMode generally are not used to collect, gather, monitor, or share personal
                    information about our users, though they can be used in conjunction with cookies to record
                    particular actions. We use Clear GIFs primarily to compile aggregated, anonymous statistics about
                    web Service or email product usage.
