<p>Layered Technologies, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, “Layered Tech”) respects the privacy and security of its customers and users of its website. Layered Tech strives to provide you with a personalized internet experience that delivers to you the information, products and services that you need. In order to achieve this goal, Layered Tech sometimes collects information during your visits to our website. Layered Tech promises that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not and will not offer for sale, share, or lease any information given to us by you, except as disclosed in this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”).</li>
        <li>Our Privacy Policy applies to prospective, current, and former customers and users. </li>
    </ul>
<p><span>We have prepared this Privacy Policy to enable you to understand which personal information of yours is collected, how and when we might use your information, how we protect your information, who has access to your information, and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. This Privacy Policy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.</span></p>

<h2 class="subhead"><span>Adherence to Safe Harbor Privacy Principles</span></h2>
	<p><span>Layered Tech adheres to the Safe Harbor requirements published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, including the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, pertaining to Personal Information (as defined below and as delineated by the EU Directive under the term “Personal Data”) of customers and users that Layered Tech receives from the European Economic Area. Layered Tech’s Safe Harbor certification can be found at <a href="http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webPages/safe+harbor+list" target="_blank">http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webPages/safe+harbor+list</a>. 
    As such, Layered Tech’s Privacy Policy and procedures for handling Personal Information are adequate for purposes of receiving personal data transfers from the European Union in compliance with Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 24, 1995 On the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data (“EU Directive”). However, customers and users should understand that adherence to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles may be limited to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest, law enforcement, or judicial process requirements; or if the effect of the EU Directive or European Union Member State law is to allow exceptions or derogations, provided such exceptions or derogations are applied in comparable contexts.</span></p>
	<p><span>For more information about the Safe Harbor Principles, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Website at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/sh_overview.html" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/sh_overview.html</a>.</span></p>

<h2 class="subhead"><span>Information We Collect </span></h2>
	<p><span>Layered Tech collects certain information from and about its users in three ways: (i) from our web server logs, (ii) with cookies and (iii) directly from the user. </span></p>
	<p><span>Web server logs: When you visit our website, Layered Tech may collect “Non-Personally Identifiable” information to administer the site and analyze its usage, such as: </span></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your Internet protocol address (explained below); </li>
            <li> The type of browser or computer you use; </li>
            <li> The number of links you click within our website; </li>
            <li> The state or country from which you accessed our website; </li>
            <li> The date and time of your visit; </li>
            <li> The name of your Internet service provider; </li>
            <li> The Web page from which you linked to our website; and </li>
            <li> The pages you viewed on our website </li>
        </ul>

<p><span><strong>Internet Protocol (“IP”) Address</strong><br>
	An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer while using the Internet from which Web servers can automatically identify your computer. Layered Tech servers gather your IP address and the webpage from where you linked to our website. Your IP address assists Layered Tech in administering and optimizing the website for you, analyzing website usage, and diagnosing problems with the website.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Cookies</strong><br>Our website uses cookies (i.e., small bits of text that our servers place into a file on your computer’s hard drive). We use cookies to save your preferences and login information, and provide personalized functionality. Cookies may also store Personal Information (defined below) you have entered so that you do not have to continually reenter the same information. You can reject cookies by changing your browser settings, but be aware that this will disable some of the functionality on the Layered Technologies’ website.</span></p>

<p><span>Layered Tech may also allow third party advertisers on our website to send cookies, but these advertisers do not have access to read Layered Tech’s cookies. Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Personal Information</strong><br>On some pages of our website, users can register to purchase products or services, receive personalized content and participate in surveys or forums. When you register, Layered Tech may ask you for some “Personal Information” which may include, but may not be limited to, your full name, postal address, phone number and email address. We may then contact you with information about Layered Tech products and services.</span></p>
	<p><span>If you purchase products or services, we may also request financial information such as credit card or bank account information. Any financial information we collect is used only to bill you for the products and services you purchased. If you purchase by credit card, this information may be forwarded to your credit card provider.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Additional Information</strong><br>As a security measure and to ensure that our website and computer network remain available to all customers, Layered Tech may use software programs to monitor network traffic or to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. These software programs may also collect information regarding your use of our website and computer network.</span> </p>
	<p><span>You may also be asked to disclose Personal Information to us so that we can provide technical support assistance and information to you. For example, we may collect Personal Information from you (such as an e-mail address, system information and problem descriptions) in order to provide online technical support and troubleshooting. If you choose to correspond with us through electronic communication (e.g. email, online chat or instant messaging), we may retain a copy of the electronic communication together with your email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone. </span></p>

<p><span><strong>Server Hosting Data Collection</strong><br>As a server hosting service provider, Layered Tech provides access to servers (which are located in the United States) for customers around the globe to store and manage their data and applications. Layered Tech does not own this specific data and is not a “controller” as outlined in the EU Directive. To the extent that Layered Tech is exposed to customer or user data, Layered Tech adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.</span></p>

<h2 class="subhead"><span>How We Use Your Information</span></h2>
	<p>Layered Tech uses the information we collect to notify you about your account and to notify you about changes to the terms and conditions governing your use of our website, products and services. We may also use the information we collect to notify you about other products and services we think you will find valuable and about special offers. You may notify us of your desire not to receive notifications relating to new products and services and special offers by “opting-out” as provided for below.</p> 
	<p>Our employees, contractors, or Agents will at times require access to your Personal Information. Layered Tech permits access to such information only for business purposes, such as administration and developing our products or servicess.</p>
	<p>In no instance will Layered Tech use your Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with the purposes described herein without your prior consent pursuant to the Opt-In and Opt-Out Provisions below.</p>

<h2 class="subhead"><span>Information Released</span></h2>
<p><span>Layered Tech may release some customer Non-Personally Identifiable information, this website’s traffic patterns, and related website usage information to our affiliates and reputable third parties on an aggregated basis. We take measures to select product or service providers that are responsible and afford similar privacy protections to their customers. However, we do not make any representations about the practices and policies of these companies.</span></p>
<p><span>Layered Tech may share or disclose Personal Information with Agents (“Agents” are persons or companies who act on behalf of or under the instructions of Layered Tech) in connection with administering or delivering Layered Tech products and services. Prior to disclosing Personal Information to its Agents, Layered Tech will either: (a) ensure that the Agent subscribes to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, (b) assess whether the Agent is subject to the EU Directive, (c) determine that the Agent complies with another “adequacy” finding or (d) execute a written agreement with the Agent requiring the Agent to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. Layered Tech will not otherwise disclose your personally information to third parties without first obtaining your consent pursuant to the Opt-In and Opt-Out Provisions below.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>SPECIAL CASES OF RELEASE</strong><br>
	Both Personal Information and Non-Personally Identifiable information may be transferred to a third party:</span></p>
    <ol>
        <li>As required by law, in a matter of public safety or policy, or as compelled by a court of law</li>
        <li>In the event of a change of ownership or assets; and</li>
        <li>To affiliated entities of common control, such as subsidiaries and parent companies. The use of  your information by these affiliates of common control will comply with this Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ol>

<h2 class="subhead"><span>Contacting You Directly</span></h2>
<p><span>Layered Tech may contact you directly through the email address or other information you provide to confirm information or purchases we have successfully received from you. Layered Tech will also contact you to respond to your questions, to provide the services you request, to manage your account, and/or to inform you of any service announcements.</span></p> 

<h2 class="subhead"><span>Opt-Out Provision </span></h2>
<p><span>If you don’t want to receive promotional materials from Layered Tech or our marketing partners, you may opt out at any time. You may “opt out” by clicking on the box marked “I DO NOT WISH TO RECEIVE SPECIAL COMMUNICATIONS FROM LAYERED TECHNOLOGIES” when you register for an account or at any time afterwards by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@layeredtech.com">info@layeredtech.com.</a> Upon properly opting-out, Layered Tech will take reasonable efforts to delete a user’s Personal Information from its database. However, please note that it may be impossible to entirely delete a user’s Personal Information because some residual information may reside on backups or records of deletions.</span></p> 
<p><span>Layered Tech will always offer you the opportunity to opt out before your Personal Information is:</span></p>
    <ol>
        <li>disclosed to a third party that is not an Agent of Layered Tech; or</li>
        <li>used for a purpose that is inconsistent with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected (as we have explicitly described to you in this Privacy Policy or at the time you provided such information) or as you subsequently authorized.</li>
    </ol>
<p><span><br>Additionally, if a user’s Personal Information to be disclosed or used in the above situations is “Sensitive Information” (i.e. Personal Information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of the individual), Layered Tech will first obtain your explicit consent by requiring you to “opt in” prior to such uses or disclosures of Sensitive Information.</span></p> 

<h2 class="subhead"><span>Third Party Sites</span></h2>
<p><span>The Layered Technologies’ website includes links, ad banners, etc. to other websites which may or may not be affiliated with Layered Tech. Notwithstanding any affiliation, Layered Tech does NOT control and is NOT responsible for the information and/or content you provide to and transactions you engage in with such third party sites. Please be aware that the operators of these other websites may collect and use different information about you that is not consistent with Layered Tech’s Privacy Policy. For any concerns as to the privacy of your information on these websites, please refer to their respective privacy policies.</span></p>  


<h2 class="subhead"><span>Children</span></h2>
<p><span>In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), Layered Tech does not knowingly collect or solicit any Personal Information from children under the age of thirteen (13)</span>.</p>

<h2 class="subhead">How We Protect Your Information </h2>
<p><span>Layered Tech has employed the use of electronic security measures to protect against the loss, theft, misuse, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure of your information submitted to our website. These measures include firewalls, use of passwords, anti-virus and detection software.</span></p>
<p><span>When we ask customers or users to provide financial information (such as a credit card number) that data is protected using Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) technology. However, please note that electronic communication (e.g. email, online chat or instant messaging) that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you in advance that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as financial information, social security numbers or passwords to us through unsecured electronic communication.</span>  </p>

<h2 class="subhead">Content Placed In Public</h2>
<p><span>Some pages of the Layered Technologies’ website may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups or instant messaging available to you. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas is public. You should exercise caution when disclosing Personal Information in these areas. Don’t disclose information in these public forums that might be considered confidential – such as financial information, social security numbers, passwords or email addresses. Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose Personal Information on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas, that information and any substantive information disclosed in the communication can be collected and used by third parties. This could result in unsolicited messages from others who post on such sites and are beyond the control of Layered Tech.</span></p>
<p><span>You represent and warrant that posting content to any public area of the Layered Technologies’ website will not infringe or violate the rights, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, such as copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets and rights of privacy and publicity of any third party.</span></p>

<h2 class="subhead">Transfer of Data Abroad</h2>
<p><span>If you are visiting Layered Technologies’ website from a country other than the countries in which our servers are located (currently the United States), the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting our website and communicating electronically with us, you consent to the processing and transfer of your data as set out in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>

<h2 class="subhead">Access to Your Personal Information and Correction of Inaccuracies</h2>
