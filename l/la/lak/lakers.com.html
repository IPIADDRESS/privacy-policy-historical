In case you are making purchases online, a credit card number (including CID number) and expiration date may be required as well as shipping, billing and other information you provide to purchase or ship an item and other transactional information based on your purchase activities through the NBA.com Network. You may also be requested to provide a unique member name and password to access and use certain features of the site. You may elect to provide us with other personal information, such as in your profile, or when you post comments or content to our public forums. If you provide personal information in these ways, please note that such information may be available to the general public. In order to better customize and enhance your membership experience, we may combine the information that you provide with supplemental information (including mailing address updates and demographic data) that we obtain from public sources or reputable third parties. Information combined with personally identifiable information becomes, and is treated as, personally identifiable information under this Policy.
							     <br><br>
							     The NBA.com Network also may collect non-personally identifiable information, including traffic statistics regarding page views, and other technical information, including IP address and standard web log information. The NBA.com Network also uses web beacons and other similar technology to track certain general usage pattern information, such as the web pages people visit within the NBA.com Network. The NBA.com Network also may log users' Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (the group of four numbers separated by periods, such as 123.45.67.89, that identifies a particular host computer) for the purposes of system administration, providing certain site functionality and content, site tracking and collecting and reporting aggregate usage information. We may combine this and other non-personally identifiable information with the personally identifiable information that we have collected, including to customize a user's membership experience.
							     In addition, the NBA.com Network may solicit from time to time your opinion (e.g., to determine your preferences and dislikes in order to provide you with a better product or offering). These surveys are always optional, and your decision not to participate in a survey will not affect your status as an NBA.com Network user.
							     <br><br>
							     <b>Use of Cookies.</b> The NBA.com Network uses "cookie" technology (including browser and flash cookies) and users' IP addresses to customize and enhance your online experience on the site. Cookies are pieces of information transferred to your hard drive when you visit our site that automatically identify your browser to our server whenever you interact with our site. Such technology is a common feature of many web sites and is necessary in order for certain features of our site to function properly or in order to provide an online service to you (e.g., membership enrollment, NBA/WNBA Store). We do not combine information that we obtain through the use of cookies with personally identifiable information, but we may combine information which we obtain through the use of cookies with other anonymous data, including a unique ID number we have assigned to you. You may customize the browser settings of your computer to notify you when a browser cookie is sent or to refuse browser cookies altogether. Please check your browser for instructions on how to make these adjustments.
							     <br><br>
							     <b>Third Party Cookies.</b> You also should be aware that the NBA.com Network cannot generally control the use of cookies (or the resulting use of information obtained from cookies) by third parties that host or provide data, content and services for, or advertise on, the NBA.com Network. The NBA.com Network uses reputable third party vendors, such as DoubleClick, to serve most of the advertisements that you see on the pages of our site. If you would like to know more about the information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures of DoubleClick, please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx">click here</a>.
							     <br><br>
							     <b>Contextual Advertising.</b> The NBA.com Network also engages a third party ad serving company, Dotomi, to display contextual advertisements about NBA products and services to you while you are visiting other sites on the Internet.  To do this, Dotomi uses cookies to collect anonymous information about your activity on the NBA.com Network.  No personally identifiable information is collected in this process.  If you do not want Dotomi to collect this information, you may customize your browser settings to reject "third party" cookies.
							     <br><br>
							     In some cases, other websites of which you are a user or member may use cookies or other technologies to collect information about your activities on the NBA.com Network (e.g., participation in NBA.com fantasy games), which such websites may then use or disclose as described on their websites. Please review the privacy policies of other websites of which you are a user or member to learn more about those sites' practices.  As noted above, you may customize your browser settings to match your comfort level with regard to the use of cookies.  If you reject all cookies, you may not have access to certain features on the NBA.com Network, including certain personalized content.  If you reject "third party" cookies, you have the ability to opt out of receiving certain contextual advertising while you are on third party websites.

									 <br><br>
									 As indicated above, the NBA.com Network may disclose personally identifiable information to those within the NBA Family. From time to time, the NBA.com Network may also share personally identifiable information with third parties we have engaged to perform certain services in connection with the operation of certain aspects of the NBA.com Network, including to customize, measure, and improve our services, content, and layout. These third party service providers are authorized to use this information only in a manner consistent with this Policy.
									 <br><br>
									 The NBA Family has several sponsors and other business partners that can offer valuable products and services to our users. Except as indicated otherwise on the NBA.com Network, the NBA.com Network will not disclose your e-mail address to these partners if you have indicated that you do not wish to receive information, special offers or promotions from third parties via e-mail. From time to time, the NBA.com Network may share or provide non-identifiable aggregated information to these partners, and, in addition, the NBA.com Network may provide them with mailing address and other information so that they may extend offers to you. If you do not want your personally identifiable information shared with these partners, you may make such a request by sending us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:FanRelations@NBA.com">FanRelations@NBA.com</a> or writing to 477 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10022, Attn: NBA.com Network Fan Relations. Your information also may be provided to an entity that acquires all or any part of the NBA.com Network's assets or in a merger or acquisition, in which case, you will be notified of such transaction and advised of any change in the applicable privacy policy. Further, we may disclose information in our discretion to cooperate with law enforcement or other government officials, or if asked to disclose information by subpoena, court order or other legal process.
									 <br><br>
									 While the NBA Family is careful in choosing its partners and advertisers, we are only responsible for content on our own sites and for use of your personally identifiable information by us. All third parties associated with the NBA.com Network and/or to which the NBA.com Network may link (including, but not limited to, advertisers, sponsors and other Internet sites) with whom we share information have independent privacy and data collection practices. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of every web site that you visit.

									 <br><br>
									 Subject to the limitations described below, if you elect to be an NBA All-Access member, you will periodically receive emails regarding your membership (e.g., emails containing or describing membership benefits, informing you of changes to your membership benefits, or providing other information about your membership). In addition, as an NBA All-Access member or as a customer at the NBA/WNBA Store, you will have the opportunity to receive newsletters, selected sponsor offers, and other promotions by e-mail.

									 <b class="nbaPPTitle">7. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control</b>
								 	 <br><br>
									 The NBA.com Network has generally accepted security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its control. The servers for the NBA.com Network that contain personally identifiable information are stored in a physically secure and climate controlled off-site facility. Beyond the physical protection of the servers, we protect against data loss by backing up data, performing consistency checks, and restricting access to information on our servers. When receiving financial information (e.g., credit card number, credit card expiration date) for completing certain online transactions, including those in connection with the NBA.com/WNBA Store, the NBA Photo Store, and NBA League Pass, our site uses SSL or "Secure Sockets Layer," an industry standard security protocol. Other features, like email and contact us, are not encrypted. When providing sensitive information on the Internet, you should also look at your browser to determine whether SSL technology is being employed (usually indicated by an image of a lock in the browser frame). In addition, only those trained employees needed to carry out our business functions will be authorized to have access to information on individual NBA.com Network customers.
									 <br><br>
									 It is important to remember that whatever you transmit or disclose online can be collected and used by others or unlawfully intercepted by third parties. No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
									 <br><br>
									 Your site membership account is password protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. At no time will any NBA.com Network employee ask for your password via e-mail. If you ever receive such an inquiry, please notify the NBA.com Network immediately at <a href="mailto:FanRelations@NBA.com">FanRelations@NBA.com</a>. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your member names, passwords and/or other account information.
									 <br><br>
									 Any information voluntarily disclosed by users and posted on our site (on message boards, web logs, and/or in chat areas) may be viewed and used by others. If users post personal information that is accessible to the public online, the user does so at his or her own risk. Users accept that they may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

You also will have the option to correct any inaccuracies in your site membership account or other registration by returning to the membership area and updating your profile and preferences or re-registering. If a member name and password are required to access the feature, you will need to provide such information to update your membership information.

									 <b>NBA.COM NETWORK NOTE TO PARENTS</b>
									 <br><br>
									 It is the NBA.com Network's policy not to knowingly solicit any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. A number of interactive features on the NBA.com Network require registration to participate (e.g., e-mail newsletters, membership). All registrants will be required to enter their full name, date of birth, e-mail address and, in some instances, zip code. If the NBA.com Network determines that a person is under the age of 13, based on the information provided during the enrollment process, that person will not be permitted to register for such features on the NBA.com Network. Instead, when a child under 13 years old tries to register, he or she will be directed to content which does not involve the submission of personal information. Children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be able to make credit card purchases or participate in interactive features on the NBA.com Network that involve the collection and retention of personal information (e.g., entering a sweepstakes) and they will not be contacted about special offers or promotions.
									 <br><br>
									 The NBA.com Network works with (and may provide links to) third party sites that offer features described on the NBA.com Network. Registration for these features is pursuant to the privacy policies of the third parties operating the web sites on which registration occurs. Such third party sites may permit children under the age of 13 to register for these features on their sites in accordance with the privacy policies posted on those sites. The operators of those third party sites are responsible for ensuring that their sites comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules. For more information, please review the privacy policies of each respective third party site.
