          is part of the VNU ("VNU") network of web sites.
        Please note that VNU does not pass personally identifiable information
        of our users to DoubleClick.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At VNU we take your privacy very seriously. Because of this we want
        to provide you with explicit information on how we collect, gather, and
        identify information during your visit to our site. This information
        may be expanded or updated as we change or develop our site. For this
        reason, we recommend that you review this policy from time-to-time to

        your acceptance of our privacy policy.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that tells
        us specifically who you are, such as your name, phone number, email or
        postal address. In many cases we need this information to provide the
        personalized or enhanced service that you have requested. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The amount
          of Personally Identifiable Information that you choose to disclose
          to VNU is completely up to you. The only way we know something
        about you personally is if you provide it to us in conjunction with one
        of our services.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">        <b>What information do we collect and how do we use it?</b></font></p>      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">VNU collects information on our users in three ways: by your voluntary
        submissions (for instance, if you sign up for one of our email newsletters)
        and/or surveys; sweepstakes and/or contest entries; and through cookie
        technology.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In our effort to provide personalization and opportunities for prizes
        and services, we may at times ask you to submit information such as your
        name or email address, or to share your interests and hobbies with us.
        You never have to answer these questions, and you can decline this exchange
        of information on any site on the Internet - not just ours - at any time.
        However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may
        not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the
        collection of this information, such as a personalized stock portfolio,
        a sweepstakes entry, or the purchase and shipment of products and prizes
        to people who visit our network.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The information VNU collects is used in a variety of ways: for internal
        review; to improve the content of the </font></p>
      <font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">site, thus making your user experience more valuable; to notify you about
      updates to the service; and to let you know about products and services
      that you may be interested in.
      </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="-1">Email: If you have provided us your email address, VNU periodically
