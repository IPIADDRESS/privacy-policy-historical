<br>
<p>LAZADA ("Company," "we," "our," "us") understands that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the LAZADA, and any further linked pages, features, content, or application services offered from time to time by Company in connection therewith (collectively, the "Website"), or using any of our services, you recognize and accept the practices and policies stated in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<br>
<p><b>What does LAZADA’s privacy policy cover?</b></p>
<br>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers LAZADA's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that the Company gathers when you access LAZADA's Website and when you use the Company’s services. This policy does not apply to practices of the companies that LAZADA does not own or control, or to individuals that the Company does not employ or manage.</p>

<br>
<p>The data we gather from clients enables us to personalize and improve our services, and allows users to set up an account and profile to make purchases via the Website.</p>
<br>

You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to benefit of many of our special features, and you may not be able to check out with your purchase through the Website. The Personal Information is used for such purposes as allowing you to purchase items, improving the content of the Website, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and the latest features.</p>
<br>

Furthermore, if we learn that a user is under 13 years of age, it is our right to promptly delete any Personal Information we have acquired about the under aged user.</p>
<br>

<ul>
<li><p>We accept and store certain types of information when you interact with our Website or services.

This information may be used to customize content or to connect with you about specials and new features.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage information, such as numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components may also be used in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.

As part of this use of data, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, en masse, use our site. We share this type of statistical information so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they, too, may deliver an optimal online experience. LAZADA never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</p></li>
<li><p>The tracking we implemented is based on Display Advertising (e.g., Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting) and can collect information such as age, gender, interests and interaction with ads impressions.
Using the Ads Settings, visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads.

</ul>

<br>
<p><i>What About Cookies?</i></p>
<ul>

We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Website's most attractive features.</p></li>
<li><p>We may use cookies to gather usage or "clickstream" data about you or others who use your computer. This information allows us to deliver targeted content that we believe will be of most interest to potential customers and/or clients.</p></li><p></p>
</ul>
<br>

<br>
