            <div class="g--whole"><p style="text-align: center;">NOTICE: This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 1, 2018.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Laserfiche.com website (the “Site”). This Site is operated by Compulink Management Center, Inc. doing business as Laserfiche and its affiliates (“Laserfiche”, “we”, “us”, “our”). This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how information is collected and used by Laserfiche. We refer to all products and services offered by Laserfiche and the Site, including its content and functionality, as the “Services.” We are committed to taking appropriate steps to help protect the privacy of visitors to our Site or users of our Services.</p>
<p><strong>By accessing or using the Site or our Services, you agree to be bound by this Policy and are accepting and consenting to the collection, use, disclosure, and other handling of your information as described below.</strong> If you are entering into the terms of this Policy on behalf of a company, organization or another legal entity (an “<strong>Entity</strong>“), you are agreeing to this Policy for that Entity and representing to Laserfiche that you have the authority to bind such Entity and its affiliates to this Policy, in which case the terms “<strong>you” </strong>or related terms herein shall refer to such Entity and its affiliates. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this Policy, you must not accept these terms and may not use the Site or Service.</p>
<p>EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”). Laserfiche may act as either a controller or a processor in respect of your personal data, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>Laserfiche, located at the address in the section entitled “Contact Us” below, is the controller with respect to information you provide through the Site.</p>
<p>Sometimes Laserfiche operates as a processor on behalf of a customer, a separate legal entity, which is the data controller. For example, Laserfiche provides cloud services to its customers and processes personal data on their behalf to provide those services. Please visit the applicable customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. Any questions that you may have relating to such personal data and your rights under data protection law should therefore be directed to the customer as the controller, not to Laserfiche.</p>
<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>When you visit or use the Site and/or Services, we collect and retain information that you, as a customer or potential customer, provide through the Site or Services, as well as information that is automatically or passively collected from you, your device or your browser.</p>

<p>We collect information that you provide directly to us. For example, when you manage your user profile, participate in interactive features (such as the Contact page), request newsletters or other marketing communications, request customer support, provide other information in connection with a job opening, enter login information, or otherwise communicate with us.</p>

</ul>
<p>If you post information on the Site, including on a bulletin board, or in a chat room or community forum, it becomes generally available to the public. Laserfiche does not control or limit the use by visitors of the Site. By posting information on the Site, you are agreeing that Laserfiche may use the information in connection with its business. Therefore, you should not post any information you consider private or sensitive.</p>
<h3>Information We May Collect</h3>

<li>We use various current – and later – developed technologies to collect this information (“Tracking Technologies”), as further discussed below.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Information We Collect From Other Sources</h3>
<p>We provide products and services for our customers, and collect and process information about individuals (including through Tracking Technologies) at the direction of our customers (“Customer Data”). Customer Data has historically included contact data, demographic data, content, service use data, device connectivity and configuration data, and location data, among other information. Our processing of Customer Data is governed by the terms of our Cloud Service Agreements with our customers. To the extent we combine Customer Data with information we have collected about you through the Site, we will treat the combined information in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by our customers. We are not responsible for how our customers treat the information we collect on their behalf, and we recommend you review their own privacy policies.</p>
<h3>Information We Collect From Other Sources</h3>
<p>We may obtain information from other third party sources that we combine with information collected through the Site. These third party sources vary over time, but have included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data brokers from which we purchase demographic data to supplement the data we collect.</li>
<li>Social networks when you reference our Service or grant permission to Company to access your data on one or more of these services.</li>
<li>Partners with which we offer co-branded services, sell or distribute our products, or engage in joint marketing activities.</li>
<li>Publicly-available sources such as open government databases or other data in the public domain.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you log into a social media website through our Site, we may have access to certain information from that website, in accordance with the procedures and practices of that social media site.</p>
<p>You should carefully review the privacy policies and terms of use of these third parties.</p>

<ul>
<li>Serve advertising tailored to your interests on our Service and Third Party Services; and</li>
<li>Fulfill any other purpose disclosed to you and with your consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of our lawful bases for processing your information stem from our customers on whose behalf we provide services.</p>
<p>We may use information that does not identify you (including information that has been de-identified) without obligation to you except as prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<p>The information we collect may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Laserfiche maintains business operations. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and as permitted under applicable law.</p>
<h3>Service Providers</h3>
<p>We will occasionally hire other companies or contract with third-party consultants to provide limited services on our behalf. Laserfiche will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver services, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>We may share your information with approved third parties for marketing purposes; this may include our authorized resellers, user group training partners, and cloud solution providers. We may also share your information with third parties who provide services to assist us with our business activities.</p>
<p>Some information about your use of the Site and Services and certain Third Party Services may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by us and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Site, Services, and certain Third Party Services.</p>
<h3>Sharing with Others</h3>
<p>We also share information about you as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may share your information with our related entities including our parent and sister companies. For example, we may share your information with our affiliates for customer support, marketing, and technical operations.</li>
<li>We share your information with our customers in connection with us processing your information on their behalf. For example, we share your information with our customers in order to facilitate your orders, maintain and administer your online accounts, respond to your questions and comments, comply with your requests, market and advertise to you, and otherwise comply with applicable law.</li>
<li>Business Partners. We may share your information with our business partners in connection with offering you co-branded services, selling or distributing our products, or engaging in joint marketing activities. For example, we may share information about you with a retailer for purposes of providing you with product support.</li>
<li>Our Promotions may be jointly sponsored or offered by third parties. If you voluntarily choose to enter a Promotion, we may share your information with third parties a set forth in the official rules that govern the Promotion as well as for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners list). By entering a Promotion, you agree to the official rules that govern that Promotion, and may, except where prohibited by applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.</li>
<li>Third Parties. We may share your information with third parties for purposes of facilitating your requests (such as when you choose to share information with a social network about your activities on the Site or Services) and in connection with tailoring advertisements, measuring and improving our Service and advertising effectiveness, and enabling other enhancements.</li>
<li>We may share your information for any other purpose disclosed to you and with your consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>We reserve the right to share your information to respond to duly authorized requests from governmental authorities as required by law, or in circumstances in which we believe disclosure is necessary or reasonably appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or others. Please note that Laserfiche is required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>Some of the hyperlinks on our Site may lead to third-party websites that are not controlled by or affiliated with Laserfiche (“Third Party Services”). These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by Laserfiche of the content on such third-party websites. If you use our Services, which include third-party integration(s), such Services are also subject to the terms of use and privacy policy of each applicable third-party entity. For example, Office Online is a Microsoft service and use of Office Online is subject to Microsoft’s terms of use and privacy policy. Laserfiche is not responsible for and does not endorse, guarantee or monitor the content, availability, viewpoints, products or services that are offered or expressed on such third-party websites and does not make any representations or warranties regarding the content or accuracy of any content on these third-party websites, including third-party privacy policies.</p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, in our sole discretion, we may share aggregated information which does not identify you or de-identified information about you with third parties or affiliates for any purpose except as prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<p>Except as described in this Policy and our Cloud Services Agreement, we will not sell, rent, or in any way intentionally disclose personal information that you provide to us on the Site to any third party (other than a Service Provider or agent acting on our behalf as described above), unless: (a) we are required to do so by law, regulation, warrant, subpoena or court order, (b) we are required in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Laserfiche employees, users of Laserfiche products or services, or members of the public, or to enforce the Terms of Use; or (c) such disclosure is part of a sale of all (or substantially all) of the assets of one or more divisions or affiliates of Laserfiche.</p>
<h2>3. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</h2>
<p>Do-Not-Track (DNT) is a preference that can be set in your browser to notify websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you. Laserfiche does not respond to DNT signals at this time. As discussed in this Policy, we and third parties may track your visits to our Site to provide targeted advertising.</p>
<h2>4. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies And Choices Regarding the Same</h2>
<p>We use Tracking Technologies to collect information, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may send cookies to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that act as a unique tag to identify your browser. These cookies help us to improve our Services and your experience. These cookies allow our Site to recognize your device to save preferences and settings for you, such as your session information. We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies help with personalizing your experience, remembering your preferences, and supporting security features. Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Service. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and generally may be controlled through your browser settings. Most browsers accept cookies by default. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to decline or delete cookies. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately. Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</li>
<li>Log Files. A log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your use of the Service, such as your service use data.</li>
<li>A pixel (also known as a web beacon) is code embedded in a website, video, e-mail, or advertisements that sends information about your use to a server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a website, video, e-mail, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a third party to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We may incorporate pixels from third parties that allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account.</li>
<li>Device Fingerprinting. Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device and apps.</li>
<li>App Technologies. There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in our apps, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. For example, our apps may include third party SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server, and is in effect the app version of a pixel. These SDKs allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account.</li>
<li>Location-Identifying Technologies. GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies may be used to collect precise location data when you enable location-based services through your device. Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your device’s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and advertising based on that location.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use tools such as “Google Analytics” and others to track the usage of this Site. Google Analytics collects information, which may include, but is not limited to, what pages are visited on the Site or what browser is used to view the Site. We use the information provided by Google Analytics to improve our Site and services. You may view how Google uses data when you use our Site by visiting Google’s Terms of Service located at: www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you by disabling cookies on your browser. You can opt-out of your data being used by Google Analytics through cookies by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.</p>
<p>We also work with ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Site, Services, and/or on Third Party Services. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our Sites, Services, and Third Party Services (including in e-mails and advertisements) to track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Site, Services, and Third Party Services or third party devices after you have left the Service (“Interest-based Advertising”).</p>
<p>We serve ads on and through Third Party Services, such as Facebook. LinkedIn and Google, that are targeted to reach people (or people similar to people) who have visited our Site or are identified in one or more of our databases (“Matched Ads”). This is done by us uploading a customer list to the Third Party Service or incorporating a pixel from the Third Party Service on our Site, and the Third Party Service matching common factors between our data and their data. To opt-out of receiving Matched Ads, please contact the applicable Third Party Service. If we use Facebook Custom Audiences to serve Matched Ads on Facebook services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such Facebook ads and find out how to opt-out. We are not responsible for such Third Party Service’s failure to comply with your opt-out instructions.</p>
<p>You can reset your device advertising Id at any time through your device settings, which is designed to allow you to limit the use of information collected about you. For information on how to do this on Apple devices, visit Apple.com. For information on how to do this on Android devices, visit Google.com. You can stop all collection of information via an app by uninstalling the app.</p>
<p>The location data collected through an app depends on your device settings and app permissions. You can exercise choice over the location data collected through our apps by (i) for GPS data, disabling location in your device settings or disabling location permissions to that app; (ii) for Bluetooth data, disabling Bluetooth and any Bluetooth scanning option in your device settings; or (iii) for WiFi data, disabling WiFi and any WiFi scanning option in your device settings. You can stop collection of all location data via an app by uninstalling the app.</p>
<p>Some of the third parties that collect information from or about you on the Site or Services in order to provide more relevant advertising to you participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. This program offers a centralized location where users can make choices about the use of their information for online behavioral advertising. To learn more about the DAA and your opt-out options for their members, please visit (i) for website opt-out, https://www.aboutads.info/choices; and (ii) for mobile app opt-out, https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices. In addition, some of these third parties may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, please visit https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
