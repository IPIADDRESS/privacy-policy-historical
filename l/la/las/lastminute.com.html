					<p><b>Terms and Conditions </b>
</p><p>This is the user agreement which governs your use of this website or, if relevant, 
one of our other distribution channels (such as Interactive TV ("IDTV"), 
mobile telephone commerce ("WAP") or interactive voice technology ("IVT") 
(the "Channels") and the purchase by you of the services and products 
we provide. Each Channel is owned and operated by a member of the lastminute.com 
limited group ("lastminute.com", "we", "us") however 
not all of the products or services we provide are supplied by us, therefore the 
contract for the product and/or service will be between you and that third party.
</p><p><b>General Section - please note that this section relates generally to your 
use of any Channel and to all products purchased.</b>
</p><ol>
<li> Please take time to read these terms and conditions it is important for both 
of us that you understand our contractual relationship relating to your use of 
the Channels. We will not allow you to purchase any products from any of the Channels 
unless you have confirmed that you have read these terms.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Except for the sale of a very small number of products (such as, for some 
entertainment tickets) our Channels operate to an agency model. This means that 
we act as a disclosed agent for third party suppliers, such as a tour operator, 
hotel or a restaurant. What this means is that the contract for the product is 
between you and the supplier. In most cases this will mean that there are additional 
terms and conditions governing the contract as each supplier will have terms and 
conditions relating to that product. Please make sure that you have read these 
terms and conditions before completing your transaction with us. You can easily 
request them from our Customer Services by using one of the methods detailed at 
the end of these terms. Where we act as agent this will mean that we have no contractual 
liability to you in respect of that product. However, we may still be liable to 
you if we have been negligent, we have misrepresented important information or 
have been in breach of any other relevant law. On the other hand, for some products, 
we act as principal. This means that the contract for the product is between you 
and us. Don't worry we will let you know where we act as principal and where we 
act as agent.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>All products sold through lastminute.com's Channels are not an offer by lastminute.com 
to sell any product, but an invitation to you to make an offer to our suppliers. 
We are free to accept that offer on behalf of those suppliers or to reject it. 
We will send you an e-mail confirming the contract if you are purchasing from 
the website, from other Channels the confirmation may be different. For example 
when purchasing via WAP we will send you an SMS or via IVT our acceptance will 
be communicated when the product is delivered. The method of concluding a contract 
will be made clear on the relevant Channel. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Because the contract for the product is between you and the supplier any queries 
or concerns relating to the product should be addressed to them. You will see 
the name and address, plus contact details, for most suppliers at the bottom of 
the more info section for each product and for all suppliers in any confirmatory 
e-mail we send you. We will of course assist you with this if you wish - please 
contact Customer Services. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Where your contract is not with lastminute.com but with a third party supplier 
such as a tour operator or hotel, lastminute.com may pass your credit card (or 
details of any other payment method allowed) and any other essential booking details 
to that third party. The placing of an order for any goods and services by you 
will constitute consent to us passing on such details. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Please make sure that you have read and understood the more info sections 
on the Channels, it is your responsibility to make sure you have done so. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>You undertake to us that the details you give to us while using the Channels 
are correct in particular that the credit or debit card you are using is your 
own and that there are sufficient funds to cover the cost of the product or service. 
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>If there are any changes to the details supplied to us by you it is your responsibility 
to inform lastminute.com via our web form or by contacting our Customer Services 
as soon as possible. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>We won't send you e-mails which you do not want but we can't guarantee that 
third parties to whom your details are sent won't do so. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Our Channels will not stop you from making impossible bookings such as two 
flights to the same place at the same time or a flight to one place and theatre 
tickets to another at the same time. If you make that kind of booking we won't 
give you a refund. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>We will do our best to correct errors and omissions as quickly as practicable 
after being notified of them. However because of the sophisticated technology 
that is required in operating lastminute.com there may be times when obvious errors 
occur. For example, very occasionally, this may result in a price, product or 
service or other detail displayed or presented on a Channel being incorrect. In 
this case we reserve the right to cancel that contract, but this of course will 
be without any liability to you. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>lastminute.com does not make any warranty that the website is free from infection 
by viruses or anything else that has contaminating or destructive properties. 
</li>

  <li><b>Cookies </b><br>
    <br>
    Each web site owned and operated by the lastminute.com group uses cookies. 
    A cookie is a small text file of which there are three types:<br>
    Session cookies: These are used to maintain something called session state. 
    If you consider your journey through the site to be a conversation with us 
    and this cookie just reminds the site where we were in that conversation (for 
    instance if at some point in the conversation you asked us to add a hotel 
    to your basket, next time you click on the basket it is still there). These 
    are required for the site to function but are not used in any way to identify 
    you personally. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Permanent cookies:</b> These store a few numbers on your hard drive. You 
    can view them by looking in the cookies directory of your browser installation 
    if you are interested. They last for a long time and each time you come to 
    our site you send us a copy of them. We use them to identify you between visits. 
    For instance if you were looking at hotels in London last time you were on 
    the site and we have a great hotel deal we may use this cookie to recognise 
    you and show you our great deal. They are not required for the site to work 
    but may enhance your experience. We do not store any personal data in these 
    cookies, just a unique number that identifies you to us. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Third Party Cookies:</b> You may have noticed that we carry advertising 
    from third parties on our site. Occasionally they may send you a cookie. We 
    have no control over these. <br>
    <br>
    Although you cannot block "session" cookies as they are required 
    for our site to function correctly you can configure your internet browser 
    so that it can reject both "permanent" and "third party" 
    cookies. How you do this will depend upon the internet browser you use (for 
    example, Internet Explorer 5, Netscape 4 or Opera etc) and it is therefore 
    impractical for us to detail here how you can reject those cookies. Please 
    refer to the relevant internet browser manufacturer's website where you should 
    be able to receive all the information you need." <br>

  <li><b>Third Party Advertising</b> <br>
    The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you, on our behalf, by 
    our Web advertising partner. Information about your visit to this site, such 
    as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or any

<p><b>(i) Regular Flights</b>
</p><ol>
<li> When you purchase a flight from lastminute.com you are using a service provided 
by Globepost Limited, a company which is a member of the lastminute.com limited group. 
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Globepost Limited is registered in England and Wales with registered number 
01700807. Its registered address is 39 Victoria Street, London, SW1E 6JP. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Generally, the more flexible the ticket the more expensive it is likely to 
be and you need to take various points into consideration before deciding between 
the fares on offer. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Bookings made online through our secure server are bonded by Globepost Limited 
under their Air Travel Organisers Licence (ATOL) 2897. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>To help you, below are Globepost Limited's general booking conditions. Please 
read them carefully. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b> Contract<br>
</b><br>
Any booking made or order placed by you, whether through the lastminute.com website 
or otherwise, shall be deemed an offer by you to purchase the relevant items subject 
to these booking conditions. Note that Globepost Limited are selling the tickets 
as agents for the airlines, which means the contract for the flight product will 
be between you and the airline.<br>
<br>
<b> Please note that for each ticket there are additional terms which are specific 
to that fare. They may, for example, state that the ticket is non-cancellable 
or non - refundable, and have other information relating to itinerary and refunds. 
You must read the FLIGHT RULES for each ticket. You can find the relevant FLIGHT 
RULES on the lastminute.com website when you progress through the purchase path.<br>
</b><br>
You are responsible for complying with any airline's terms in relation to check-in 
times, reconfirmation of flights or other matters. In relation to flight tickets, 
you are required to use all flight coupons in order of sequence. If this requirement 
is not met the airline may void the ticket.<br>
<br>
A contract arises between you and the airline when we send you a confirmation 
e-mail on behalf of Globepost Limited confirming that they have accepted your 
booking. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Fares <br>
</b><br>
All fares are quoted exclusive of taxes, plus the tax amount and then a total. 
These are added together to form your final quotation. Fares are subject to change 
without prior notice and are only guaranteed when following confirmation of the 
contract.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Reservations<br>
</b><br>
In the vast majority of cases Globepost becomes aware of the availability of flights 
tickets for sale because it connects to large databases operated by third parties, 
which contain that availability. These databases are commonly called General Distribution 
Systems (GDS) or Central Reservation Systems (CRS), and it is through these GDS/CRS 
that Globepost purchases the relevant ticket. <br>
<p>Be aware that certain airlines do not maintain "real time" seat availability 
in the GDS/CRS. Whilst every effort is made to reflect the true situation, instances 
may occur when airlines cancel sales. Globepost Limited will advise you within 
48 hours if this is the case and will do all they can to reinstate your booking. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Further, there are a tiny number of airlines which participate in the GDS/CRS, 
but do not participate in the UK Ticketing plan. In the unlikely event that you 
purchase tickets from an airline that does not participate in the UK Ticketing 
Plan, Globepost will be unable to issue the relevant tickets, and will have to 
terminate the reservation. 
</p><p> 
</p><p>In either instance we will not be liable for any additional costs incurred 
in having to purchase new tickets at a higher fare. Payment for tickets will of 
course be refunded to you if the reservation is terminated by the airline or us. 
<br>
</p></li>
<li><b>Tickets<br>
<br>
</b>If it is not possible to get your flight tickets to you (eg because your travel 
date is imminent) we may insist that you have an "e-ticket" generated. 
This means that you will have to pick up your ticket at your point of departure. 
Don't worry, Globepost will make sure you know exactly where to pick up your tickets. 
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Flight Reconfirmation<br>
</b><br>
All onward , outward and return flights must be reconfirmed with the relevant airlines at 
least 72 hours prior to the commencement of that leg of the journey. 
Globepost Limited accepts no responsibility for bookings cancelled due to non-compliance 
with rules set by that particular airline. Globepost also take no responsibility 
for any flight rescheduling en route.<br>
<br>
In the event of a schedule change it is not always necessary to have your tickets 
revalidated, however in the event that this is necessary we will inform you in 
due course and issue new tickets for you to use on your journey. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Passports/Visas/Health Requirements<br>
</b><br>
Globepost and lastminute.com are very happy to inform you of current documentation 
requirements if you so require. It is incumbent upon you to ensure that you meet 
the passport, visa, health requirements of the countries you wish to visit and 
those that you transit (even if it is for a plane change). Many countries require 
that your passport should be valid for a period of (a minimum) six months from 
the date of arrival into that country. Neither Globepost nor lastminute.com accept 
any responsibility if you should be denied boarding or deported due to non-fulfilment 
of the above. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b> Insurance<br>
</b><br>
Globepost strongly urges you to carry appropriate travel insurance to cover you 
for cancellation, health, baggage etc. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b> Airline regulations/conditions of carriage<br>
</b><br>
Please note that in all transactions Globepost acts as agents of the airlines 
you have chosen to book on. Please read your ticket wallet for their conditions 
of carriage.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Cancellation / Amendments<br>
</b>If you need to change or cancel your travel plans, it is your responsibility 
to notify Globepost in writing of such request. Some tickets are non-refundable, 
but can be applied (for a limited time) toward future travel, less any applicable 
penalties. Some tickets do not allow changes.<br>
<br>
Globepost applies an administration fee of £45 per person for any modifications, 
changes or cancellations to fares. This will be regardless of the price or face 
value of the fare.<br>
<br>
In addition to the Globepost charges, most airlines also have a penalty or cancellation 
fee for any changes or cancellations to fares. Please ensure you read the FLIGHT 
RULES for the fare selected as airline charges are notified in those rules depending 
on whether you wish to cancel or change your flight. If you are holding a booking 
for which a ticket has been arranged and you do not notify us in writing of your 
desire to cancel, this will be treated as a "no show" and could result 
in you losing all that you paid. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b> Refunds<br>
</b><br>
If you want to cancel your journey it is important that you notify us in writing 
with utmost urgency. This enables us to cancel your reservation with the airline. 
If you already have your ticket please submit it to us. Tickets must be sent to:<br>
<br>
Returns<br>
PO Box 866<br>
Crawley<br>
RH10 1UD<br>
<br>
On receipt of the ticket we will send you an acknowledgement that we have received 
it. Those tickets which are refundable or cancelled by us will be processed and 
refunded back to your credit card in approximately 16 weeks from our receipt of 
the ticket. Some tickets may need to be submitted to the airline for the cancellation 
and/or refund to be authorized. In this event your refund request may take longer, 
but we will advise you in our acknowledgement of the expected turnaround period. 
Please note that most airlines do not refund on part used tickets. Tickets which 
are returned more than 1 year from date of issue are classified as expired tickets 
and must be submitted to the airline for their authority to refund. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Lost Tickets<br>
<br>
</b>If you lose your tickets, it may be possible to re-issue them for a fee. The 
amount payable will depend on the circumstances of the loss and how close to the 
travel date you discover it. However, not all tickets can be re-issued; which 
is another good reason for ensuring you have sufficient insurance cover. Tickets 
will be dispatched to you in accordance with your instructions and we accept no 
responsibility for their delivery. Lost tickets which cannot be re-issued are 
refunded at the sole discretion of the airline, these refunds can take up to one 
year to be authorized. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Liability<br>
<br>
</b>As Globepost acts as agent this will mean that it will have no contractual 
liability to you in respect of the flight product. However, it may still be liable 
to you if it has been negligent, it has misrepresented important information or 
has been in breach of any other relevant law. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b> Unreasonable behaviour<br>
<br>
</b>If in the reasonable opinion of a person acting in authority you are not fit 
to travel, he or she may refuse to let you board the aircraft. Normally this happens 
if such person thinks you are likely to disturb or harm other passengers. In this 
case your contract with Globepost will end immediately and we will no longer be 
responsible for you. <br>

    <p> <b>(ii) Charter Flights</b> 
</p></li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li> In the sale of charter flights Globepost Limited (part of the lastminute.com 
    plc group) acts as agent for various third party suppliers. The contract for 
    the charter flight will be between you and the relevant supplier and you will 
    be subject to their terms and conditions. To read those terms and conditions 
    please <a href="/lmn/banner/flights/terms/charterterms.htm" target="_blank"><b><font color="#000000">click 
    here</font></b></a>. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>In addition as we incur cost in administrating cancellations and modifications, 
if you ask us to administer any relevant cancellation and/or amendment on your 
behalf we will charge an administration fee of £45. Please be aware that 
this fee will be in addition to any charge you may have to pay the supplier. 
<p><b>(iii) No Frills Flights</b>
</p><p>Note: the service we provide for you in respect of the purchase of standalone 
(ie not part of a package holiday) no frills flights (eg from BMI Baby etc) is 
a different service than the service we provide for the sale of other airline 
tickets. These special terms apply to that service:
</p><p>1. In the sale of stand alone no frills flights (eg from BMI Baby etc) we will 
search the relevant no frills database, and then, if you choose to buy, will purchase 
the flight seats on your behalf directly from the airline. We will receive an 
itinerary/confirmation email from the no frills airline which we will forward 
directly to you by email. This service is provided by our Flights subsidiary company 
Globepost Limited.
</p><p>2. If you have any query in respect of the flight, please contact our customer 
services who will approach the relevant airline on your behalf. We will, of course, 
use our best endeavours to ensure that all of your requests are complied with, 
however, if the no frills airline imposes any fee or charge on us to effect these 
changes, we reserve the right to pass on the charge to you. 
</p><p>3. You will be subject to the terms and conditions of the relevant no frills 
flights which will be deemed to be incorporated into this contract. They can be 
accessed from the relevant no frills website.
</p><p>4. Remember if you purchase the no frills flight through our dynamic packaging 
technology to create a holiday package, your holiday will be governed, not by 
these terms, but by our dynamically packaged holiday terms and conditions <a href="##linkhols"><b>below</b></a>.

these terms, you will be subject to the terms and conditions of the third party 
supplier, such a supplier could include a tour operator or an airline. Please 
contact our Customer Services who will be able to provide those terms and conditions 
to you. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Where the supplier of the Holiday Product allows you to cancel or modify a 
Holiday Product or service you must contact lastminute.com in writing of such 
a request. Unless we receive such a written request lastminute.com will be unable 
to effect that request. Please note that because the contract for the Holiday 
Product is between you and the supplier, lastminute.com have no discretion in 
deciding whether the Holiday Product can be cancelled or modified.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> Any visa, passport and inoculation requirements are your responsibility and 
failure to obtain the relevant documentation is not the responsibility of lastminute.com. 
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Please note, some of our Holiday Products are sold "subject to availability" 
what this means is that we do not confirm your order immediately (your first confirmation 
e-mail will just be an acknowledgment of order) but we will pass your details 
onto our suppliers who will check to see if the Holiday Product is available, 
if it is they will book it for you, if its not they will revert to you directly. 

Please see the 'More Info' text for each "subject to availability" Holiday 
Product for more details" <br>

of departure. Don't worry, we will make sure you know exactly where to pick up 
your tickets. <br>

</li>
  <li>When you create your own package holiday (for example when you package together two or more of a flight, hotel or carhire) on the lastminute.com site (or any other site using the lastminute.com dynamic packaging technology) your contract will be with LM Travel Services Limited ("we", "us") which is part of the Travelocity group. LM Travel Services Limited holds an Air Travel Organisers License (ATOL 3970) for your financial security and are members of ABTA (E7760).

<li><b>A.B.I. code of practice <br>
<br>
</b>Under the Association of British Insurers General Business Code of Practice, 
we must draw your attention to some important features of your insurance including:<br>
<br>
<b>1. Insurance document.</b> You should read this carefully. It gives full details 
of what is and is not covered and the conditions of the cover. <br>
<br>
<b>2. Conditions and exclusions.</b> Specific Conditions and Exclusions apply 
to individual Sections of your insurance, whilst General Exclusions and Conditions 
will apply to the whole of your insurance. <br>
<br>
<b>3. Health.</b> This insurance contains restrictions regarding pre-existing 
medical problems concerning the health of the people travelling and of other people 
upon whose health the trip depends. You are advised to read the document carefully. 
<b><br>
<br>
4. Property claims. </b>These claims are paid based on the value of the goods 
at the time you lose them and not on a 'new for old' or replacement cost basis. 
<br>
<br>
<b>5. Limits.</b> This insurance has limits on the amount we will pay under each 
Section. Some Sections also include other specific limits, for example, for any 
one item or for valuables in total. <br>
<br>
<b>6. Excesses.</b> Under some sections of this insurance, claims will be subject 
to an excess. This means you will be responsible for paying the first part of 
the claim. The excesses apply separately to each section and to each person claiming, 
unless otherwise stated. <br>
<br>
<b>7. Date change exclusion.</b> Changes in dates could see widespread failures 
of computer and other systems containing computer chips, which depend on date-related 
information in order to work properly. Your policy excludes anything directly 
or indirectly caused by failure of any computer hardware or software or other 
electrical equipment to recognise or process any date as the true calendar date.<br>
<br>
<b>8. Reasonable care.</b> You need to take all reasonable care to protect yourself 
and your property, as you would if you were not insured. <br>
<br>
<b> 9. Dangerous sports and pastimes. </b>If you are going to take part in dangerous 
sports or pastimes where there is a risk of injury, check that this insurance 
covers you. <br>
<br>
<b>10. Customer service. </b>We always try to provide a high level of service. 
However, if you think we have not lived up to your expectations, please refer 
to the Complaints Procedure. <br>
<br>
<b>11. Cooling-off period.</b> This insurance contains a 14 day 'cooling off' 
period during which you can return it and get a refund if you have a justifiable 
reason for being dissatisfied with the cover, provided no claims have been made 
and you have not travelled.<br>

<ol>
<li> In most cases for the sale of Gifts lastminute.com is acting as a disclosed 
agent for a third party supplier. You will usually be able to find the name and 
address of the relevant supplier on the more info sections relating to each product, 
and in all cases in your confirmation e-mail. <br>
<br>
</li>
  <li>Remember the contract governing the purchase of the Gift will contain the 
    terms and condition of the supplier. This will mean that ultimately any decision 
    on cancellation, returns etc will belong to the supplier. <b>Please <a href="/site/help/contact-us.html" target="_blank">contact 
    Customer Services</a> for details of relevant terms and conditions. </b><br>
<br>
</li>
<li>In addition to the above, however, we have agreed with our suppliers to offer 
you a 10 day no quibble returns policies for certain Gifts and products. Please 
note a description of which products are included and which are excluded from 
this policy is given at paragraph 5 of this section C. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The returns policy is as follows: <br>
<br>
(i) We will arrange a full refund of the full price you paid (including outward 
delivery charges) if you contact our Customer Services explaining that you wish 
to cancel the contract within 10 days of your receipt of the product. Please make 
sure that you inform us of the order number, product description, reason for return 
and whether you require a replacement or refund; <br>
<br>
(ii) Paperwork will be sent out with your gift which will give you more information 
on how to effect a return, including where to send the product. Remember because 
in many cases we are agent and do not control any stock, this may not be lastminute.com 
but the supplier from whom you purchased the product; <br>
<br>
(iii) On the earlier of the receipt by the supplier or 30 days after notification 
of cancellation we will effect refund; <br>
<br>
(iv) If you request a replacement product our Customer Services will attempt to 
arrange this for you but whether this option is available remains at our supplier's 
discretion; <br>
<br>
(v) Remember to keep the product reasonably safe and to return them in a reasonably 
good condition. Please use recorded delivery in order to minimise the risk of 
the refunded item not being returned safely; and <br>
<br>
(vi) If you do not send it back the supplier can arrange to have in picked up 
from your address, in this case you will be charged the cost of this pick up. 
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> Please note that that this policy does not affect your statutory rights which 
you may have, including the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 
2000. If you would like any further information please contact your local Trading 
Standards Office on (020) 7641 1111 or access their website at www.tradingstandards.gov.uk. 
Alternatively, please contact your local Citizens Advice Bureau on 020 7385 1322 
or access their national website at www.nacab.org.uk <br>
<br>
</li>
<li> Our 10 day returns policy only applies to certain products. It will apply 
for most gifts, but will not apply to those gifts which, are bespoke (that is, 
they are made to order), can be copied and the seal has been broken (for example 
computer games, cds etc) or are perishable (for example chocolates, flowers etc). 
They will also not apply to those gifts which are likely to quickly deteriorate. 
In addition and for the avoidance of doubt our 10 day returns policy does not 
relate to Holiday Products (eg flights, holidays and hotels etc), restaurant bookings, 
entertainment tickets, auctions or experiences (eg drive a Ferrari, bungee jumping 
etc) where you receive a voucher to take up an experience within a certain period 
of time <br>
<br>
</li>
<li> Please note that just because our 10 day no quibble guarantee does not apply 
to any product does not necessarily mean that for all other products there isn't 
a returns policy. Remember for each product there are separate supplier terms 
and conditions governing that contract which may contain a returns policy. <b>Please 
remember to request this from our Customer Services.</b><br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Prices for an experience are on a per person basis unless otherwise stated, 
they will include delivery of the relevant voucher within mainland UK and will 
include VAT, again unless otherwise stated. Vouchers for the experience package 
will be delivered by the supplier with whom you have contracted within the stated 
delivery times. Please see the more info section for each product for more details 
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Although our experiences suppliers will have third party liability insurance 
it is your responsibility to ensure you are adequately covered. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The information for each experience is given in good faith and is consistent 
with the information supplied by the supplier to lastminute.com. <br>

you must have submitted the valid Bid retraction request to lastminute.com not 
less than 12 hours before the auction closes<br>

closes, is the highest Bid which exceeds the reserve and meets any other conditions 
of the relevant auction. Your contract is concluded with the Vendor at the time 
the auction closes and if you are the winning Bidder.<br>

</p><p><br>
10. The Vendor reserves the right to accept a Bid which is the highest Bid at 
the time the auction closes but which does not meet the reserve.<br>

Bid by accessing your secure online lastminute.com auctions account - ''My Account''.

</p><p><br>
12. If your Bid is followed by a higher Bid which is later removed by lastminute.com

higher Bid had never been made. <br>

by you in your auctions account will be debited for the total amount of your Bid 
in that auction plus postage, where applicable.<br>

14. Goods will be dispatched to the delivery address specified by you at the time 
of placing your Bid once payment has been received.<br>
If you win an auction but your credit card is rejected by our systems, we reserve

</p><p>15. lastminute.com reserves the right to refuse or remove any Bid including, 
inter alia, those in respect of which there is dispute, which are withdrawn by 
the Vendor, or which fail to reach the reserve. <br>

16. Each auction is conducted in a single currency, being pounds sterling, unless 
otherwise stated. The actual cost to you, if you pay in a different currency,

not give you a refund.<br>

funds to cover the cost of the product, service or Bid.<br>

</p><p><br>
22. Please note that most goods are non-refundable and non-exchangeable, subject 
always to your statutory rights, but ultimately your contract is with the Vendor 
and any decision regarding returning the goods you have purchased is at their 
discretion.<br>

any goods or services will constitute your consent to us passing on such details.
