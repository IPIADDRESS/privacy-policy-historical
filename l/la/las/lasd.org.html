         PRIVACY POLICY</b></center>
         
         <p>The Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County recognizes
         the public's concern about privacy on the Internet. This
         privacy statement establishes how information gathered about
         you from your visit to our Website will be used by this
         Website's operators. As a visitor, however, you should be
         aware that much information submitted to the Los Angeles
         County Sheriff Department is public information under the
         laws of the State of California. Under some circumstances,
         we may be required to disclose such information in
         accordance with the California Public Records Act or other
         legal requirements.</p>
         
         <p>The following describes how information may be collected
         depending on your activities at this Website:</p>
         
         <p><b>If you read or download information:</b><br>
         We may collect and store information for statistical
         purposes. For example, we may count the number of visitors
         to the different sections of our site to help us make them
         more useful. The information collected may include such
         items as the name and domain of the host from which you
         access the Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of
         the computer you are using or your browser software and
         operating system. This information does not identify you
         personally.</p>
         
         <p><b>If you send E-mail to this Website:</b><br>
         By sending us an electronic mail message, you may be sending
         us personal information (i.e., your name, address, e-mail
         address, etc.). We may store the name and address of the
         requester in order to respond to the request or otherwise
         resolve the subject matter of your e-mail. You should know
         that e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception
         and may be subject to the disclosure requirements of the
         Public Records Act or other legal disclosure
         requirements.</p>
         
         <p><b>If you fill out a form or submit an application or
         request other specific information:</b><br>
         The Los Angeles County Sheriff Department may ask visitors
         who request specific information to fill out a form. For
         example, when requesting information about a crime report,
         civil process, weapon permits, or other subjects, the
         visitors may be asked to provide their names, addresses,
         e-mail addresses and other pertinent information to ensure
         we can process and deliver the information requested. Other
         information may be collected at these sites through
         questionnaires, feedback forms or other means to enable us
         to determine a visitor's interests with the goal of
         providing better service.</p>
         
         <p><b>Consequences of failing to provide
         information:</b><br>
         If you choose not to provide us with your name or other
         information, it may be impossible for us to refer, respond
         to, or investigate the issue you are concerned about.</p>
         
         <p><b>Sharing information:</b><br>
         We may share personally identifying information with other
         Los Angeles County Departments or Law Enforcement agencies
         in the course of carrying out our normal business
         operations.</p>
         
         <p>We may disclose information about inmates, wanted
         suspects, missing persons, etc. as required in the normal
         course of our duties.</p>
         
         <p><b>Links to non-Los Angeles County (third party)
         Websites:</b><br>
         Our Website also contains links to information located on
         Websites maintained by other public agencies and private
         organizations. Once you access an individual document that
         links you to another Website, you are subject to the privacy
         policy of the Website containing that document.</p>
         
         <p><b>Gaining access to information and providing
         corrections:</b><br>
         If you want to get information about you that may be in our
         records, the California Public Records Act provides you
         certain rights to this information. Contact this department
         through the email address or telephone number noted on our
         web site and make a specific request for a copy of the
         information we have received online from you and have
         stored. If you find that this information is inaccurate or
         incomplete, you may provide us with verified accurate and
         complete information.</p>
         
         <p><b>Information transmitted by user is not secure from
         interception</b><br>
         We take several measures to protect the transmission of the
         information you submit to us when you use our web site.
         However, there is a possibility that information transmitted
         to us over the Internet may be intercepted by a third
         party.</p>
         
         <p>If you choose to send us email, or fill out an on-line
         form on our web site, you should know that the information
         is not necessarily secure against interception, and may be
         subject to the disclosure requirements of the California
         Public Records Act or other legal disclosure
         requirements.</p>
