                apply to any personal information provided or gathered by LabArchives, LLC.</p>
              <p>Your use of this Web Site
                indicates to us that you have read and accept our privacy practices, as

              <p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT
                YOU DO WE COLLECT?</strong></p>
              <p>When you visit our Web
                Site, you may provide us with two types of information: (1) personally
                identifiable information that you knowingly choose to disclose, which is
                collected on an individual basis, and (2) general user information that does
                not contain personally identifiable information, which is collected on an
                aggregate basis as you browse the Web Site. In some cases, if you choose not to
                provide us with requested information, you may not be able to access all of our
                Web Site's content or services.</p>
              <p>In addition to providing
                us with information through the Web site you may also provide us with
                personally identifiable information that you knowing choose to disclose when
                registering interest in LabArchives products and/or services.</p>
              <p><strong>Personally
                Identifiable Information You Choose to Provide.</strong></p>
              <p>We may ask for certain
                personal information from you for the purpose of providing to you content and/or
                services that you request. For example, if you indicate an interest in one of
                our newsletters or Blogs, you are asked to submit your name and e-mail address,
                which we retain on file, so that we may send you the information that you
                requested. We may retain a record of users who have contacted us in order to
                respond properly to questions or concerns and for purposes of future
                communications and marketing programs.</p>
              <p> <strong>Non-Personally
                Identifiable Information We Collect.</strong></p>
              <p>Cookies/ Web server logs:
                Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web Site utilizes standard
                technology called "cookies" and Web server logs to collect
                information about how our Web Site is used. Cookies are a feature of Web
                browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to
                access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's
                Web browser on the user's hard drive. Information gathered through cookies and
                Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time
                spent at our Web Site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our
                Web Site.</p>
              <p>You can, of course,
                disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or
                options menus in your browser. However, LabArchives will not allow you to log in if you disable cookies. You should consult
                with your browser's provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding
                disabling cookies.</p>
              <p><strong>HOW DO WE USE THE
                INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</strong></p>
              <p>We use your personally
                identifiable information to provide you with the information or content that
                you have requested, and, in some cases, to contact you about our programs,
                products, features or services. If you no longer wish to receive such
                information from us, please <a href="mailto:support@labarchives.com">contact
                the webmaster</a><a href="mailto:support@labarchives.com" target="_blank">.</a></p>
              <p>We use non-identifying
                information collected on our Web Site in the aggregate to better understand how our users interact with the Web Site and to enhance their enjoyment and experience. For
                example, we may use the information to improve the design and content of our
                Web Site or to analyze the programs and services that we offer.</p>
              <p>We may employ other
                companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Our employees,
                agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information
                are required to protect the information in a manner that is consistent with
                this Privacy Statement.</p>
              <p>We may provide access to
                your personally identifiable information when legally required to do so, to
                cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect
                against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web Site, to limit our legal
                liability and protect our rights, or to protect the rights and safety of
                visitors to this Web Site or the public. In those instances, the information is
                provided only for that limited purpose.</p>
              <p>We will not share your
                personally identifiable information in ways unrelated to those described above

              <p>LabArchives will not provide unaffiliated third parties with access to your
                email address or other contact information. LabArchives or the LabArchives
                Affiliates may, from time to time, share with you information about other

              <p><strong>DATA SECURITY</strong></p>
              <p>LabArchives has security measures in place to protect against the loss,
