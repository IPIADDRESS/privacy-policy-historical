    <p><strong>Special Notice to Talent</strong></p>
    <p>There are practical considerations relating to the need for
     agents and casting directors to review certain personal
     information, and considerations relating to the need to contact
     talent in order to cast them. By submitting your information on
     this Site, you understand that you are affirmatively choosing to
     post personally identifiable information about yourself, including
     contact information such as your phone number and e-mail address,
     as well as identifying information such as your height, weight,
     hair and eye color. You also have the option to post photographs,
     video and other information that may allow third parties to
     personally identify and locate you. Others will be able to view
     this information. By registering to be on this Site, you are
     agreeing to have personally identifiable information revealed to
     third party members who use this Site, and you are acknowledging
     the risks inherent in so doing. Please see our tips on privacy
     section for ways to protect yourself and your personal
     information.</p>
    <p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
    <p>Like most interactive websites, each time you visit the Site, we
     automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which
     you came. In order to administer and optimize the Site for you and
     to diagnose problems with the Site, we use your IP address, which
     helps us identify you and gather broad demographic information
     about you and where you logged in from. Our server logs may also
     capture and collect additional information such as your web
     request, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your
     request, and/or the date and time of your visit, all of which helps
     us track users' movements around our site and understand
     trends.</p>
    <p>The Site uses cookies to keep track of your activity on the Site
     and to enhance your experience on the Site. We also use cookies to
     deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password,
     and if you so choose, to save other personal and financial
     information so you do not have to reenter it each time you visit
     the Site. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or
     read cookies on your browser should you click through to their
     website. If you wish to disable these cookies, the Help portion of
     the tool bar on most browsers will tell you how do that. If you set
     your browser to disable cookies, however, you may not be able to
     access certain parts of this Site.</p>
    <p><strong>Information Your Provide</strong></p>
    <p>In order to operate the Site and to provide agents, talent and
     casting directors with information that facilitates the casting
     process, we also collect the information that you provide when you
     sign up for a Casting Networks account, including personal contact
     information, financial information, and demographic information.
     Personal contact information is information that you provide which
     can be used to contact you directly without going through the Site
     and may include your full name, postal address, phone number, or
     e-mail address. Financial information that you provide and that we
     collect may include your credit card number or password.
     Demographic information is information that you submit or we
     collect that is neither personal nor financial; this may include
     but is not limited to your zip code, postal code, hometown, gender,
     user name, your age, height and weight. We also collect your
     account password, browsing history information and searching
     history information, registration history information, and the
     content of communications between you and other members of this
     Site, subject to the rest of this paragraph. Demographic
     information is divided into two categories: (1) non-public
     information, which consists of purchase history information and
     your exact address; and (2) public information which consists of
     all other demographic information. We ask that you do not enter
     personal information or financial information into your public
     profile. For example, don't use your full address or password as
     your user name and don't post it in your public profile. Also,
     remove your full name and address in your written responses. If you
     choose to include personally identifiable information in your
     profile, it may be publicly posted on the Site, and we cannot
     control who may access such information and/or what they do with
     the information you provide. Publicly posted information will be
     treated as demographic information by CNI. In addition, other
     members will be able to view this information.</p>
    <p>Please note that nowhere on this Site do we knowingly collect
     personal information from children under the age of 18, unless they
     are represented by an agent, a parent or a guardian.</p>
    <p><strong>Third Party Sites</strong></p>
    <p>On this Site, we may place links to other websites operated by
     third parties. We strive to limit those links only to websites that
     provide goods and services to you about products that you may be
     interested in. Some of these other websites contain our brand name
     and trademarks and other intellectual property that we own, others
     do not. When you click on these links and visit these other
     websites you should be aware that you are leaving the CNI Site and
     that we do not control these third party websites nor can we make
     any claims regarding those websites' Terms of Use or Privacy
     Policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party
     websites. Operators of these other websites may collect different
     kinds of information about you and may use and disclose that
     information in different ways than we would if it were collected on
     this Site. These websites may use tracking tools, such as cookies,
     to collect information about you and/or the computers used to view
     or interact with their advertisements. We encourage you to review
     those third party Privacy Policies and remind you that we will not
     be responsible for their actions.</p>
    <p><strong>How We Use Your Personal Information</strong></p>
    <p>We use your e-mail address and your other personal information
     to help us efficiently operate the Site. We also use this
     information to contact you in connection with your transactions and
     other activities on the Site (including but not limited to
     confirmation e-mails for important news that could affect your
     relationship with us), and to forward messages to you from other
     registrants. These types of communications are known as maintenance
     communications. In some cases maintenance communications may also
     contain commercial messages such as banner ads and special
     offers.</p>
    <p>We also use personal information to send you newsletters,
     information, offers and other promotional materials for CNI's or
     third parties' goods and services. We attempt to send you offers
     that are of value to you such as information relating to
     photographers or agents, exclusive offers or other special event
     information. The Site provides you with options to decline to
     receive communications from CNI other than those contained in our
     maintenance communications. Some of these options may only be for a
     certain category of communications, others may be more general. By
     posting a profile on the Site you are opting in to receive
     maintenance communication information from CNI as well as CNI
     newsletters and other communications. To stop receiving CNI's
     newsletter, go to the e-mail address section of your account
     profile and uncheck "Send me Priority Emails including important
     information that pertains to my membership and the monthly
     'Networker'."</p>
    <p>Additionally, CNI may process your personal information for the
     following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Providing our services to you, including display of customized
      content and advertising;</li>
     <li>Fulfilling your requests for services;</li>
     <li>Facilitating the use of the Site;</li>
     <li>Managing your account preferences;</li>
     <li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect
      and improve our services;</li>
     <li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network;</li>
     <li>Developing new services.</li>
     <li>Identifying and protecting against misuse or unauthorized use
      of our Site; and</li>
     <li>Enforcing our Terms of Use.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To operate the Site, including processing any transactions and
     supporting any activities you do on the Site, we may share your
     personal information with our agents, representatives, contractors
     and service providers so they can provide us with support services
     such as authorization of credit card transactions, e-mail
     originations, receipt of support services, customer relationship
     management services, order fulfillment and sweepstakes promotion
     fulfillment. We require these entities not to use your information
     for any other purpose. Moreover, registrants on this Site,
     including agents and casting directors, are not authorized to use
     your information for any other purpose.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you are visiting the Sites from outside of the United States,
     please be advised that your information will be transferred to,
     stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are
     located and our central database is operated. The data protection
     and other laws the United States and other countries might not be
     as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that
     we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is
     protected. By using our services, you consent to the transfer of
     your information to our facilities and those third parties with
     whom we share it as described in this Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Promotional Relationships and Co-Branded
     Pages</strong></p>
    <p>In some cases we may enter into a promotional relationship with
     another company in which we prominently display their brand name or
     trademark on pages of the Site. These pages are known as co-branded
     pages and these companies are known as co-branded companies. If the
     page on which you submit information is a co-branded page, or was
     accessed by clicking on a link on a co-branded page, then we may
     share your personal information with the associated co-branded
     company. Co-branded companies may use your personal information in
     accordance with their own Privacy Policies. You will need to
     contact co-branded companies to instruct them directly regarding
     your preferences for use of your personal information by them.
     Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all such
     information so submitted to such co-branded companies in the same
     manner than which we are entitled to use and disclose any
     information you submit to us.</p>
    <p>Some co-branded pages may contain an action pack that a third
     party such as an advertising company may use to read cookies that
     it or its clients may have placed on your browser. This technology
     is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements on such
     other websites that promote co-branded pages. These third parties
     may use the information collected through this technology to learn
     more about your visits to the Site and other websites in order to
     provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
     We have been informed by these third parties that unless you are
     otherwise notified, they do not use your name, address, e-mail
     address or telephone number and do not link your on-line actions to
     any information that can be used to identify or contact you.
     However, because we may not verify that this is the case, you
     should seek their assurances yourself as we are not accountable for
     the accuracy of the above statement.</p>
    <p>We strive to create relationships with advertising and
     fulfillment partners that believe in and respect your privacy, too.
     While we do not control the third-party websites of our partners,
     we do strongly encourage our partners to post Privacy Policies
     clearly and conspicuously and to protect the information of their
     users.</p>
    <p>Any third party with whom we are allowed to share your personal
     information is authorized to use your personal information in
     accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third
     parties and in accordance with their own Privacy Policies, over
     which we have no control, and you agree that we are not responsible
     or liable for any of their actions or omissions. Those who contact
     you will need to be instructed directly by you regarding your
     preferences for the use of your personal information by them.</p>
    <p>California has passed legislation requiring certain specific
     disclosures be made available to California residents who use the
     Internet and provide information that may be used for marketing
     purposes. That legislation requires any business that discloses a
     customer's personal information to any third party for direct
     marketing purposes to provide the customer a method for obtaining
     the names, addresses and certain other specified details of anyone
     who might have received that personal information. If you are a
     California resident, you may request this information from CNI by
     writing to</p>
    <p>Casting Networks, Inc.<br>
     Attn: California Privacy Rights<br>
     3250 Wilshire Blvd.<br>
     Suite 1800<br>
     Los Angeles, CA 90010</p>
    <p>or by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@castingnetworks.com">support@castingnetworks.com</a>.
     CNI is not obligated to respond to more than one such request from
     you per calendar year.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Additional Ways That We May Share Your Personal
     Information</strong></p>
    <p>Talent not represented by an agent, agents and casting directors
     may be asked to provide financial information to use and access
     this Site. We use your financial information to check your
     qualifications and to bill you for any services provided on this
     Site for which we charge. You consent to our providing your
     financial information to our service providers and to such third
     parties as we determine are necessary to support and process your
     activities and transactions as well as your credit card issuer for
     their purposes. These third parties may include the credit card
     companies and banking institutions used to process and support the
     transaction or activity. By registering or taking advantage of
     services offered on this Site or by participating in programs
     offered on this Site that are administered by third parties and
     that require you to submit financial information in order to use
     them, you also consent to our providing your financial information
     to those third parties. Additionally if the page on which you
     submit information is a co-branded page as defined in an earlier
     section, or was accessed by clicking on a link on a co-branded page
     then we may share your financial information with the associated
     co-branded company. Any of these various third parties including
     co-branded companies may be authorized to use your financial
     information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with
     such third parties and in accordance with their own Privacy
     Policies over which we have no control. You agree that we are not
     responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions.
     Additionally you agree that we may use and disclose all such
     information so submitted to such third parties in the same manner
     in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information
     that you submit to us.</p>
    <p>Your personal information or financial information may be passed
     on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership of
     assets or a bankruptcy. We may also use and/or disclose personal
     information or financial information without your prior consent
     when we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or
     disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a)
     satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, court order,
     subpoena or enforceable government request; (b) enforce our Terms
     of Service, including investigation of potential violations
     thereof; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security
     or technical issues; or (d) protect against the imminent harm to
     the rights, property or safety of CNI, its registered members, or
     the public as required or permitted by law. We also may disclose
     your personal information or financial information to our
     subsidiary and parent companies and businesses and other affiliated
     legal entities in businesses with whom we are under common
     corporate control. Whenever personal information or financial
     information is disclosed under this paragraph we may also disclose
     your demographic information along with it. All of our parent
     subsidiary and affiliated legal entities are businesses that
     receive your personal information, financial information or
     non-anonymous demographic information from us and will comply with
     the terms of this Privacy Policy with respect to their use and
     disclosure.</p>
    <p>We review all demographic information. We may also use public
     information to enable other users to find your profile to determine
     whether they are seeking information about you for a specific
     casting role and to communicate with you. We may use this
     demographic information to help you navigate the Site to best find
     matches for you. We may also share information on an anonymous
     aggregate basis and to the extent that we have advertisers we share
     the information with to help them determine if their products and
     services will appeal to our users. We do not identify specific CNI
     users by name in these cases. If you respond directly to an
     advertiser any information you provide them directly will not be
     subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>CNI will not share your personal information except as in the
     manner set forth in the Privacy Policy in effect at the time and/or
     as specifically authorized by you. Certain personal information
     however, including contact information, contained within a member's
     portfolio is always available to professionals within the industry
     ("Industry Professionals") who are entitled to share such
     information for project-specific professional purposes. Although
     CNI requests that Industry Professionals submit certain credentials
     and make certain representations to CNI, CNI cannot guarantee the
     truth and/or accuracy of these credentials and/or
     representations.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When you provide information in connection with open casting
     notices, such information is available to the persons posting such
     open casting notices (who may or may not be Industry Professionals)
     and, CNI has no control over the manner in which this information
     is used.</p>
    <p><strong>Information Security</strong></p>
    <p>CNI takes commercially appropriate security measures to protect
     against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,
     disclosure or destruction of data that you share and we store.
     These security measures include internal reviews of our data
     collection, storage and processing practices and security measures,
     as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized
     access to systems where we store personal data.</p>
    <p>We make commercially reasonable efforts to restrict access to
     personal information to CNI employees, contractors and agents who
     need to know that information in order to operate, develop or
     improve our services. These individuals are bound by
     confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline,
     including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to
     meet these obligations. Unfortunately, no security system can be
     100% secured; accordingly, CNI cannot guarantee the security of any
     information provided to us in connection with the information that
     we collect through our website.</p>
    <p><strong>Changes To This Policy</strong></p>
    <p>Please note that we will continue to have the right to change
     our Privacy Policy and practices and how we use your personally
     identifiable information, without notice, as described in the first
     paragraph of this Privacy Policy. We will post any Policy changes
     on this page and, if we make material changes in the way we
     collect, use or share your personal information, we will, within 30
     days, provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain
     services, e-mail notification of Policy changes to the email
     address you most recently provided to us).</p>
    <p>If at any point we decide to use your personally identifiable
     information in a manner different from that stated in the Privacy
     Policy in effect at the time it was collected, we will you an
     effective way to opt out of the use of your personal information
     for those other purposes.</p>
    <p>If CNI becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of
     sale or transfer of some or all of its assets, we will provide
     reasonable notice before personal information is transferred and
     becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>How We Manage Children's Information</strong></p>
    <p>This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13.
     Because we understand that agents and casting directors use this
     Site to find Talent of all ages, we allow parents to register their
     children on the site and to manage their information. Agents and
     managers who represent minor talent may be required to verify that
     they have received consent from a parent or guardian prior to
     posting information about minors on the Site.</p>
    <p>In addition to the foregoing, our Policy is not to admit any
     child under the age of 13 to any portion of the site, regardless of
     whether parental consent to have a profile posted on the Site has
     been submitted to us. Children over the age of 13 may, with
     parental permission, monitor their personal information posted on
     the Site.</p>
    <p>For safety reasons, anyone who uses search criteria to look for
     Talent under the age of 18 may be required to reconfirm their
     password and name. Searches may be tracked and recorded. We may
     also keep track of the number of searches and visits you have made
     to a particular talent profile and may release this information
     pursuant to a court order or other legally binding directive,
     including an emergency search warrant.</p>
    <p>We remind parents, guardians, and Talent that providing their
     password or account information to anyone other than the registered
     member is a violation of our <strong>Terms of Use</strong> and may
     result in termination of your membership.</p>

     personal information, or the practices of this Site, you may
