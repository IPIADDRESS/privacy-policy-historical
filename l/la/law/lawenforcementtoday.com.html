run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely
assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the
domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of

purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to
a specific page. We also use cookies to track click streams and for load
balancing. You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most
