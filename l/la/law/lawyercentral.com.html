A cookie is a small piece of data or a text file that is downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you access certain websites. Cookies may contain text that can be read by the web server that delivered the cookie to you. The text contained in the cookie generally consists of a sequence of letters and numbers that uniquely identifies your computer or mobile device; it may contain other information as well. </p> <p> <strong>By agreeing to accept our use of cookies, you are giving us, and third parties we partner with, permission to place, store, and access some or all the cookies described below on your computer.</strong> </p> <ul> <li> <em>Strictly Necessary Cookies</em> <br> These cookies are necessary for proper functioning of the website, such as displaying content, logging in, validating your session, responding to your request for services, and other functions. Most web browsers can be set to disable the use of cookies. However, if you disable these cookies, you may not be able to access features on our website correctly or at all. </li> <li> <em>Performance Cookies</em> <br> These cookies collect information about the use of the website, such as pages visited, traffic sources, users' interests, content management, and other website measurements. </li> <li> <em>Functional Cookies</em> <br> These cookies enable the website to remember a user's choices - such as their language, user name, and other personal choices - while using the website. They can also be used to deliver services, such as letting a user make a blog post, listen to audio, or watch videos on the website.</li> <li> <em>Media Cookies</em> <br>These cookies can be used to improve a website's performance and provide special features and content. They can be placed by third parties who provide services to us or by our company. </li> <li> <em>Advertising or Targeting Cookies</em> <br>These cookies are usually placed and used by advertising companies to develop a profile of your browsing interests and serve advertisements on other websites that are related to your interests. You will see less advertising if you disable these cookies.</li> <li> <em>Session Cookies</em> <br>These cookies allow websites to link the actions of a user during a browser session. They may be used for a variety of purposes, such as remembering what a user has put in their shopping cart as they browse a website. Session cookies also permit users to be recognized as they navigate a website so that any item or page changes they make are remembered from page to page. Session cookies expire after a browser session; thus, they are not stored long term.</li> <li> <em>Persistent Cookies</em> <br> These cookies are stored on a user's device in between browser sessions, which allows the user's preferences or actions across a site (or, in some cases, across different sites) to be remembered. Persistent cookies may be used for a variety of purposes, including remembering users' choices and preferences when using a website or to target advertising to them. </li> </ul> <p>We may also use cookies for:</p> <ul> <li>Identifying the areas of our website that you have visited</li> <li>Personalizing content that you see on our website</li> <li>Our website analytics</li> <li>Remarketing our services to you</li> <li>Remembering your preferences, settings, and login details</li> <li>Targeted advertising and serving ads relevant to your interests</li> <li>Allowing you to post comments</li> <li>Allowing you to share content with social networks</li> </ul> <p> Most web browsers can be set to disable the use of cookies.

The information we collect by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor the number of people who open our emails. Web beacons also help us to understand the behavior of our customers, members, and visitors. </p> <p> <strong>Google Ad and Content Network Privacy Notice</strong> <br> Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's past visits to our website. Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visits to our site and/or other sites on the Internet.

Google Analytics collects information from users such as age, gender, interests, demographics, how often they visit our website, what pages they visit, and what other websites they have used before coming to our website. We use the information we get from Google Analytics to analyze traffic, remarket our services to users, improve our marketing, advertising, and to improve our website. We have enabled Google Analytics advertising features such as remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit our website, not your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected using Google Analytics with PD. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our website, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google also uses specific identifiers to help collect information about the use of our website. For more information on how Google collects and processes your data, visit <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a> </p> <p> You can prevent Google Analytics from using your information by opting out at this link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a> </p> <p> <strong>Google Remarketing</strong> <br> Why am I seeing ads by Google for products and services I've viewed? <br> Our website uses a remarketing advertising service. Our remarketing service is provided by Google and other companies that show our ads on websites across the Internet. With remarketing you may see ads for our services you have previously looked at. As an example, suppose you visit a website that sells computers, but you do not buy a computer on your first visit to that website. The website's owner might like to encourage you to revisit his/her site and buy a computer by showing you his/her ads again on other websites that you visit. We use remarketing for similar purposes. For this to happen, Google will read a cookie that is already in your browser, or they place a cookie in your browser when you visit our site or other sites using remarketing. You can opt out of Google's use of cookies and remarketing at this link: <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en">https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en</a> or you can opt out using the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page at: <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/</a> </p> <p> <strong>Facebook Remarketing</strong> <br> Third parties, including Facebook, may use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from our website and elsewhere on the internet, and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads. With Facebook remarketing you may see our ads on Facebook after you have visited our site. For this to happen, Facebook uses a Custom Audience Pixel that is activated when a visitor lands on a webpage and a unique "cookie" is placed in their browser. Facebook lookalike audience targeting allows us to show ads on Facebook to people who are similar to those who have already visited or made a purchase from our website. To opt out of Facebook's collection and use of information for ad targeting visit: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217">https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217</a> </p> <p> <strong>Remarketing</strong> <br> Our website and applications use remarketing advertising services other than Google and Facebook. These remarketing services are provided by companies that show our ads on websites and devices across the Internet. With remarketing you may see ads for our products you have previously looked at. For this to happen remarketing companies will read a cookie in your browser. This can only happen if your browser is set to let it happen. You can opt out of these types of advertising cookies by visiting <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a> </p> <p> <strong>Hotjar Disclosure</strong> <br> We use <a href="http://www.Hotjar.com">www.Hotjar.com</a> in order to better understand our users' needs and to optimize this service and experience.
