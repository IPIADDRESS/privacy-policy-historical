<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) explains what Online Legal Media (“OLM”) does with the personally identifiable information that is collected from the users of our website currently located at http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com (the “Site”).  It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personally identifiable information and how you can access and update this information.  This Policy is incorporated into our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Services</a>.  By using the Site, you accept the terms of this Policy.</p>

<p>OLM may change its privacy policy from time to time, so it is suggested that you check the Site from time to time to ensure that you know about the current policy.  If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Policy, you should contact us via our <a href="https://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/contact.html">Contact Page</a>.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>If you are under 18, you may not use or access the Site.</p>

<h3>Types of Information We Collect</h3>

<p><i>Traffic Data</i>.  We  may collect a variety of visitor data such as IP addresses, browser settings, internet service provider (ISP) information, referring/exit pages, operating systems, date/time stamps, and clickstream data (collectively, “Visitor Data”).  No personally identifiable information is collected in this process.  The Site may use Visitor Data to compile traffic data about the types of visitors who use the Site at specific intervals (collectively, “Traffic Data”).  We may use Traffic Data to analyze Site traffic, but this information is not examined for personally identifiable information.  We may also use Traffic Data to diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, or display content according to your preferences.  Visitor Data and Traffic Data may also be shared with business partners, affiliates, or advertisers on an aggregated and anonymous basis.</p>

<p><i>Cookies</i>.  We may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and third-party providers, including Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting (see below for more information on this), that allow us to store a small piece of data on your computer, or any other device you may use to access the Site, about your use of the Site.  Such cookies do capture or mine personally identifiable information.  You can remove persistent cookies at any time by following the directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory.  If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site but the functionality of the Site may be limited.</p>

<p><i>Web Beacons</i>.  We employ web beacons that help us track referrals from our partners and affiliates and better manage content on the Site.  Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages.  We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to user’s personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><i>Third Party Tracking</i>.  The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners, or other third parties linked to from the Site is not covered by this Policy.  Please be aware that these third parties may use cookies, web beacons or other tracking devices, and we do not have access to, or control over, these technologies.</p>

<p><i>Personally identifiable information</i>.  We may collect personally identifiable information that you provide in order to access certain features of the Site. Such personally identifiable information includes your name, address, phone number, and email address.</p>

<p><i>Data Retention</i>.  OLM will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you services, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.  We may maintain some or all of this data in our archives even after it has been removed from the Site.</p>

<h3>How OLM Uses Your Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

<p>OLM will only disclose any personally identifiable information about individual users in accordance with this Policy and our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a> or to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of OLM.</p>

<p>OLM discloses personally identifiable information and the other information you provide us to lawyers, law firms, legal financial service providers, or other legal service providers sponsoring the submission forms for the topics to which you respond.  OLM cannot guarantee that the information you submit to us will not end up in the hands of third parties, including, without limitation, the entity or person against whom you may have a claim.</p>

<p>OLM may also disclose your contact information and the other information that you provide us in the following circumstances:
</p><ol>
	<li>OLM may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Such parties may have access to personally identifiable information if needed to perform their functions, but will not be able to legally use it for other purposes.</li>
	<li>OLM might change, sell, reorganize or liquidate its business via bankruptcy.  If so, your information may be among the transferred assets or otherwise transferred in a way not contemplated by this Policy.  In such event, you will be notified via notice posted to the Site.</li>
	<li>OLM may release account and other personally identifiable information when OLM believes such release is appropriate to comply with law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of OLM, our users, or others.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<p>From time to time, OLM may also provide aggregate (statistical) information to third parties to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.  If OLM partners with another party to provide a specific service to you, and if you sign up for such service, then and only then will OLM provide your other information to such partner.</p>
