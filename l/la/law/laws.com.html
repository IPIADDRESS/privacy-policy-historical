 privacy is important to us at Laws.com. We are committed to respecting 
your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information, 
traffic information and communications content.&nbsp;</span></p><span class="style2"><br>This Privacy Policy describes our collection, use and sharing of personal information, which members voluntarily provide to us.<br><br><br>1. Collection of Information<br><br><br>Personal
 information. When you sign up for a particular service that requires 
registration at our website, we ask you to provide us your personal 
information. If we later use this information in a manner different from
 the purpose, for which it was collected, then we will ask for your 
consent prior to such use. <br><br>You may decline to submit personal 
information to any of our services, in which case we may not be able to 
provide such services to you.<br><br>Member profile. Your professional 
profile is the information you decide to make available to other 
members. Your member profile may include your member name, full name, 
email address, telephone number, gender,&nbsp; and any other information that
 you decide to make available. You control your member profile, and you 
can access it in order to view, correct, add or remove personal and 
public&nbsp; information. <br><br>Contact information. Your account name, 
your email address, phone number and address is displayed to other 
members in your public directory listing. Other members can contact you 
using this information. <br><br>Location information. When you share 
your location with others or add a location to your posting, we treat it
 like any other content you post. <br><br>Transactional information. We 
may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on our 
website. However, it is only with your consent that we will keep your 
payment source account number.<br><br>Site activity information. We keep
 track of the actions you take on the site, such as&nbsp; posting 
information. In some cases, you are also taking an action when you 
provide content to us. For example, if you shared some content with us, 
we might log the fact that you shared it.<br><br>Access information. 
When you access the site from a computer, mobile phone, or other device,
 we may collect the information from that device about your browser 
type, location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visited.<br><br>Cookie
 information. We use cookies and similar tools to track site usage and 
to customize the content and advertising you receive based on the 
profile information you provided. A cookie is a small file, which 
resides on your computer and allows us to recognize it when you return 
to the site. We use cookies to improve the quality of our services by 
storing preferences and tracking trends. <br><br>In the course of 
serving advertisements or optimizing services for our members, we may 
allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on 
your browser. Any information provided to third parties through such 
cookies will not be personal, but may indicate a general segment, e.g. 
your industry or geographic location, your occupation, or information 
about your professional and educational background, for greater 
customization of your member experience. <br><br>Most browsers are 
initially set up to accept cookies, but you can adjust your browser to 
block cookies or to alert when a cookie is being sent.<br><br>Log files 
and information about your computer. Due to the Internet communications 
standards, when you visit our site we automatically receive the Uniform 
Resource Locator (URL) of the site, from which you came, and the site, 
for which you are leaving us. We also receive information about your 
computer, its operating system and the type of web browser it is using, 
email patterns, as well as the name of your Internet Service Provider 
(ISP). This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us 
improve our services and is not shared with third parties without your 
consent.<br><br>Consent to processing information about you. By 
providing information for the purpose of opening your member account, 
you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of 
this Privacy Policy. Your providing of such information is entirely 
voluntary on your part.<br><br>No information from persons under age 18.
 Persons under age 18 are not eligible to use our services. If you are 
under 18 year of age, you may not register for our site or provide any 
personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have 
collected personal information from someone under age 18, we will 
immediately delete this information.<br><br><br>2. Use of Personal Information<br><br><br>Service
 management. We use the information we collect from you to provide our 
services and features to you, to measure and improve these services and 
features, and to provide you with customer support. <br><br>Communications
 with you. We communicate with you through email and notices posted on 
our website. You will receive emails from us related to the proper 
functioning of your account. You can change your email address&nbsp; and 
contact preferences at any time.<br><br>Sharing information with third 
parties. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise transfer your personal 
information to third parties for marketing purposes. We only share your 
information with third parties to carry out your instructions or to 
provide specific services or information. E.g., we may use a credit card
 merchant company for subscription fees. Such third parties do not 
retain, share, or store any personal information except to provide their
 services, and they are bound by confidentiality agreements, which limit
 their use of such information.<br><br>Sharing your resume with third 
parties. Our searchable database of job postings and resumes enables 
third parties, such as employers, recruiters, data collectors, marketers
 and others, to see your personal information, and to contact you. You 
have to be aware that these third parties may reside in jurisdictions, 
which may not have adequate legal personal information protection. We do
 not control these third parties, and we are not responsible for their 
use of the personal information you make available on our website. 
Therefore, you should avoid posting sensitive information in your 
personal profile. <br><br>We share personal information with third 
parties to help us in the delivery of our services to you. However, we 
cannot disclose such information to third parties unless you consent to 
such disclosure. E.g., if you make your resume searchable, all parties 
with access to our searchable database will have access to your resume. 
Or, if you indicate by configuring your profile that you wish to receive
 information about the services of third parties, we supply your contact
 information to these third parties for the purpose of their 
communicating with you. We use the information we have about you to 
determine, whether you might be interested in the services of a third 
party. <br><br>You may control the information and status of your 
resume. You may also remove your resume from our database at any time by
 accessing your account.<br><br>Your resume must not contain sensitive 
information relating to your racial or ethnic origin, political views, 
religious beliefs, membership in a social or political organization, 
physical or mental condition, harmful addictions, sexual orientation and
 criminal record, unless you intentionally wish that such information be
 present in your resume. Your resume must not contain any information 
you do not wish to share with a potential employer.<br><br>Producing 
personalized advertising. We do not share your information with 
advertisers without your consent. However, we may allow advertisers to 
choose the characteristics of members who will see their advertisements,
 and we may use non-personal information to select the appropriate 
audience for these advertisements.<br><br>Supplementing your profile. We
 may use the information about you, which we collect from other members,
 to supplement your profile. In such cases, we leave you an opportunity 
to remove that information or limit its visibility.<br><br>Surveys and 
polls. You may receive requests from other members to participate in 
market research including polls and surveys. The information you provide
 for such purposes may be visible to other members of our website. <br><br>Linked
 websites and third party applications. Our website may contain links, 
which will let you leave it and access other websites. Linked websites 
are not under our control and may have different privacy policies. Our 
Privacy Policy solely applies to personal information that is passed to 
our website, and we do not accept responsibility for privacy policies of
 other websites. <br><br>If you use a third party application, the 
provider of such application may obtain access to certain personal 
information about you. We do not, and cannot, control how this provider 
may use such personal information. Please review any privacy policies or
 terms of use of a third party application before installing it.<br><br><br>3. Changes to Personal Information<br><br><br>Editing
 your profile. You can update or correct your personal information, 
email preferences&nbsp; any time by visiting your profile page. The 
information will be updated immediately.<br><br>Deactivating or deleting
 your account. If you wish to stop using your account, you may 
deactivate or delete it. When you deactivate your account, it becomes 
invisible to any member, but it will not be erased. We will save your 
profile information in case you later decide to reactivate your account.
 When you delete your account, your personal information becomes 
permanently erased. <br><br><br>4. Protecting Personal Information<br><br><br>Security
 measures. We use administrative, technical and physical measures to 
safeguard your personal information in our possession against loss, 
theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, we 
try to make sure that this information is accurate, current and 
adequately complete.<br><br>Limitations on security measures.&nbsp; 
Information publicly posted in your profile will become available to all
 users of Laws.com, therefore please do not post any personal 
information in your professional profile.&nbsp; We are not responsible for 
third party circumvention of privacy settings or security measures on 
our website. You can reduce these risks, however, by choosing a strong 
password, using different passwords for different services, and using 
up-to-date anti-virus software.<br><br><br>5. Disclosure of Personal Information<br><br><br>Except
 as provided below, we will not transfer any personal information, 
traffic information or communications content to any third parties 
without your express consent, except to protect or defend our legal 
rights or property, to protect the safety and security of other members 
or members of the public, to protect against fraud, or to comply with 
the law or legal process. If we become involved in a merger, 
acquisition, or any form of sale of our assets, we will ensure the 
confidentiality of any personal information involved in such a 
transaction and will provide notice before personal information is 
transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.<br><br><br>6. Changes to Privacy Policy<br><br><br>Laws.com
 may update this Privacy Policy at any time, with or without notice. Our
 current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about 
you and your account. It is important, therefore, that you review this 
Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that you are updated as to any 
changes. <br><br>If you have questions or comments about this Privacy
