	<h1>LawGuru.com Privacy Policy</h1>
	<br>
	<div class="terms">
		<p>LawGuru.com is operated by WebSiteBroker, Inc. LawGuru Answers, the Attorney Network (also referred to as the Lawyer Network in some jurisdictions), and the LawGuru Answers public database are all services provided by LawGuru.com. For simplicity, when we refer in this Privacy Policy to LawGuru.com, that term also refers to and includes WebSiteBroker, Inc., and its owners, managers, partners and employees. By using our Site, you represent that you are 13 years old or older and you consent to the information collection and use practices described herein. </p>
                        
<p>The use of LawGuru.com is governed by this Privacy Policy, the various disclaimers appearing on our site, and our Terms &amp; Conditions. By visiting or using LawGuru.com you agree to be bound by these terms. In addition, you understand that the specific method, features and services offered on LawGuru.com may be altered, improved, removed or adapted at any time by LawGuru.com in its sole discretion and without any notice. If you do not agree with any of these terms, do not use this site.</p>
                        
<p>This website, is deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer and personal information.</p>
                        
<p><b>A. Consumer Information</b>
</p><p>During the process of delivering our content and information to you, we do not automatically collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, we do obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). The information collected by us is used for the purpose of analyzing our traffic and sometimes for targeting ads.</p>
                        
<p>In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in order to register for our newsletters, when signing our guestbook, to submit a question on LawGuru Answers (formerly referred to as the Knowledge Base), or in response to a specific ad. This information is used by us to respond to your request. We may at times combine this information with other users' information and review it in an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who visit our website. We will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your permission except in the following circumstances: i) to protect ourselves from liability; ii) to respond to a legal process or comply with the law; iii) in a limited number of jurisdictions and legal fields, to have your case reviewed for free by a law firm that practices in the area of law of your case; and iv) as discussed in Section B below, to facilitate the answering of questions submitted to LawGuru Answers and including certain of these questions and answers in the LawGuru Answers public database as an information resource to the public.</p>
                        


<p><b>B. Questions Submitted to LawGuru Answers</b>
</p><p>In connection with the submission of "Free Questions" and "Paid Questions" to LawGuru Answers, we only require, and we encourage you to only provide, the minimum amount of personal identifying information necessary to process a question. All of your personal information provided to LawGuru.com, including email addresses, is concealed from all other users of LawGuru.com and is never published as part of the LawGuru Answers public database. Only the LawGuru.com administrators have access, for purposes of site administration only, to this information. LawGuru.com will not disclose this information to third parties without your permission, except in the following circumstances: (i) to protect ourselves from liability, or (ii) to respond to legal process or to otherwise comply with the law. With respect to certain information supplied by you, as explained further below, there will be a need for disclosure to Attorney Members (also referred to as Lawyer Members in some jurisdictions) when you are asking a Paid Question.</p>

<p>Whether other information submitted to LawGuru.com by you, such as the content of the Question itself, will be publicly disclosed will vary as between Free Questions and Paid Questions:</p>

<p> <b> i)  Free Questions &amp; Answers.</b>  After a Free Question is answered, the Free Question and its answer are automatically posted to the LawGuru Answers public database. The contents of these Free Questions and their answers are visible to all users of LawGuru.com and to Attorney Members. Thus, Free Questions and answers to them are neither confidential nor privileged in any way. Although the contents of the Free Questions and their Answers are visible, the names and identifying information of the user who submitted the Free Question will not be visible to all users of LawGuru.com and Attorney Members. Of course, you must understand that, because the LawGuru Answers public database is public, you may lose some privacy by posting Free Questions and answers in the LawGuru Answers public database. Your view of the facts, or the way you frame a question, may well reveal something about your thinking about a problem that you may not want others to know. It's your choice.</p>

<p> <b>ii.  Paid Questions &amp; Answers.</b>  Unlike a Free Question, when a Paid Question is answered, the contents of the Paid Question and Answer are kept private and are not visible to the other users of LawGuru.com or to other Attorney Members. However, before answering a question, Attorney Members must first determine that there are no conflicts of interest. In order to accomplish this, the Attorney Member must be supplied with the full name of the user submitting the question and, when available, their zipcode. Similarly, LawGuru.com administrators will have access to this information in order to ensure that it is properly transmitted to Attorney Members and for the purpose of getting your question answered.</p>

<p>In posting a Paid Question, you are giving permission to LawGuru.com to transmit this information to Attorney Members and to provide access to this information to LawGuru administrators for this purpose. LawGuru.com expressly agrees with respect to Paid Questions to respect and protect the confidentiality of any confidential client information or attorney-client privileged information contained in your Paid Question and in the answer provided by an Attorney Member. Other than as indicated above, we will not disclose this information to third parties without your permission except to respond to a legal process or comply with the law.</p>
                        
<p><b>C. Cookies</b></p>

While we believe that cookies enhance your Internet experience, they are not required to use our site.</p>

<p>If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information.</p>

<p><b>D. Opting Out</b></p>
<p>If at any time you no longer wish to receive the information you originally requested to receive from us (e.g. newsletters, etc.), please <a href="/writeus.html">contact us</a> and we will remove your information from our system.</p>
<p>If you have any additional questions about our dedication to consumer privacy, please <a href="/writeus.html">contact us</a>.</p>
                
<p><b>E. Third Party Ads</b></p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website.

If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">click here</a>.

</p><p>LawGuru.com may also work with advertisers who may collect information that you would voluntarily provide to them. Please refer to those advertisers individual privacy policies for information on how they manage the privacy of this information.</p>

<p><b>G.  Consent to Collection and Processing in the United States.  </b></p>

<p>By using LawGuru.com, you consent to having your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States. For users in England and Wales, the information you provide to LawGuru.com is also subject to the Data Protection Act 1998.
