            Privacy</font>   </p></b>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we 
            provide this notice explaining our online information practices and 
            the choices you can make about the way your information is collected 
            and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available 
            on our home page and at every point where personally 
            identifiable information may be requested.</p>
            <p>This notice applies to all information collected from or 
            submitted to the following Martindale-Hubbell ("Martindale") Web 
            site(s), but to make this notice easier to read we will refer here 
            only "our Web site", meaning either Martindale.com or lawyers.com. 
            Other Martindale Web sites may operate under their own privacy 
            notices.</p>
            <p>Our Web site contains links to other Web sites operated by third 
            parties. Martindale is not responsible for the privacy practices or 
            policies of such third party Web sites.</p><b>
            <p><a name="collect"></a><font size="5">The Information We 
            Collect</font>   </p></b>
            <p>  Our Web site is not set up to 
            automatically collect personally-identifiable information from&nbsp;visitors to our Web 
            site. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not e-mail 
            addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider 
            our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information 
            about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular 
            visitors to our Web site. This information is used only for internal 
            purposes by our technical support staff.</p>
            <p>Our Web site does track certain information about the visits to 
            our Web site. For example, we compile statistics that show the 
            numbers and frequency of visitors to our Web site and its individual 
            pages. These aggregated statistics are used internally to improve 
            our Web site and for product development and marketing purposes 
            generally. Those aggregated statistics may also be provided to 
            advertisers and other third parties, but again, the statistics 
            contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such 
            information.</p>
            <p>In a few areas on our Web site, we may ask you to provide 
            information that will enable us to verify whether you are entitled 
            to access and use certain information, materials and services 
            available from our Web site, or to enable us to enhance your site 
            visit, to assist you with customer service or technical support 
            issues, or to follow up with you after your visit, or to otherwise 
            support your customer relationship with Martindale. It is completely 
            optional for you to participate. However, failure to participate may 
            mean that you cannot access and use certain information, materials 
            and services.</p>
            <p>For example, we may request information from you when you:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Log-on to certain areas of our Web site, where you may be 
              prompted to provide us with your user name and password as a 
              condition to gaining access to certain information, materials or 
              services. 
              </li><li>Register or sign-up to subscribe to a service. 
              </li><li>Subscribe to a newsletter or desire to be added to our mailing 
              lists for other products or services. 
              </li><li>Place an order. 
              </li><li>Participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer. 
              </li><li>Provide feedback in an online survey.</li></ol>
            <ol></ol>
            <p>In each of the instances above, we typically ask for your name, 
            e-mail address, phone number, address, the type of business you are 
            in, product preference information, any applicable identification 
            number or password that we may require, as well as other similar 
            personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to 
            services or offers. On occasion, we may ask for additional 
            information to enable us to provide you with access to and use of 
            certain information, materials and services. In the case of mailed 
            materials, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at 
            any time.</p><b>
