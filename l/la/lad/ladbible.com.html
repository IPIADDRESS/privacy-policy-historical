By submitting your information to us (including, but not limited to, all personal information and User Content (as defined in the Terms of Use)), you are agreeing to the processing of your information by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IP addresses</strong></p>
<p>We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Where we store your personal information</strong></p>
<p>3.1 The information that we collect from you may be transferred&nbsp;to,&nbsp;and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>4.1 We will implement reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect your personal information from unauthorised access, use and disclosure, including requiring any third party to whom we disclose your personal information to implement similar safeguards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.2 Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our sites and therefore any transmission is at your own risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Uses made of the information</strong></p>

<p>5.1.1 To ensure that content from our sites is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.1.2 To provide you with information, products or services that you request or which we feel may interest you, from us or from third parties, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes including contact by email, post and telephone;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5.2 We may use User Content (as defined in the Terms of Use) as set out in the Terms of Use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.3 If you do not want us to use your information as described&nbsp;at&nbsp;condition 4.1.2 above, or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, please make the appropriate selection on the form on which we collect your information (the registration form) or notify us in accordance with condition 6.1 below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.4 We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in the LS1 postcode). We may make use of the personal information we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers’ wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of your information</strong><br>
6.1 We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.</p>

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.2.3 Where you have given your consent, so that such third parties may contact you directly in relation to goods or services which may be of interest to you; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.2.4 In the event that we use third parties to process personal information on our behalf (for example, we may use a third party to provide website hosting services or to facilitate the provision of information to you or to provide services on our behalf).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.3 Where third parties process your personal information on our behalf, we will ensure that they have adequate security measures in place and are governed by our privacy policies in respect of the use of your personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your rights</strong><br>
7.1 You have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your personal information) if we intend to use your personal information for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by making the relevant selection on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us in writing at 20 Dale Street, Manchester, M1 1EZ or by emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:contact@ladbible.com">contact@ladbible.com</a></p>

Please check any policies before you submit any personal information to any of these websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Access to information</strong><br>
8.1 The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10.00 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.
