<p>LayItLow.com respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information that you share with us. Generally, you can browse through our website without giving us any information about yourself. When we do need your personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.</p>

<a name="#info"></a>
<h5>Information Collection</h5>

<p>Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, personal interests, other information when needed to provide a service you requested.</p>

<p>When you browse our website, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously indicated that you wish LayItLow.com to remember your login and password. We don't automatically collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to any personal information unless you have logged in to our website. Like many other websites, the LayItLow.com website may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. Please go to <a href="#cookies">"Cookies and Tracking Information"</a> below for more information.</p>

<p>LayItLow.com collects personal information when you use certain LayItLow.com products or services, submit an entry for a sweepstakes or other promotions, or when you submit your personal information to LayItLow.com for any other reason. From time to time, LayItLow.com receives personal information from business partners and vendors. We only use such information if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Policy and applicable laws.</p>

<a name="#notice"></a>
<h5>Notice</h5>

<p>When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point of collection the purpose for the collection. LayItLow.com will not transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent, except under the limited conditions described under the discussion entitled <a href="#information_sharing">"Information Sharing and Disclosure"</a> below.</p>

<p>If you choose to provide us with your personal information, we may only transfer that information, within LayItLow.com or to LayItLow.com's third party service providers with your permission. Upon receiving your permission, we may transfer your information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.</p>

<p>We will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing or market research information. This means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this Policy unless you take affirmative action to indicate that you do not consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at the point of collection. In some cases, when applicable, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in." This means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted.</p>

<a name="#cookies"></a> 

<h5>Cookies and Tracking Technology</h5>

<p>A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them.

We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information.</p>

<p>If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of LayItLow.com if you do so. In particular, you may be required to accept cookies in order to complete certain actions on our website. You do not need to have cookies turned on, however, to use/navigate through many parts of our website, except access to some parts of LayItLow.com may require a login and password.</p>
