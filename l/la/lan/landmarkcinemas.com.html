<p><strong>6. <a name="6"></a>How we share your information</strong></p>
<p>We may share information we collect about you in the following circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliates and Service Providers providing services to us or on our behalf</strong><br> Our Affiliates and Service Providers provide services to us and may provide services to you on our behalf.&nbsp; We may share your Personal Information or information that we have collected through automated means on our Site with our Affiliates and Service Providers.&nbsp; For example, our Affiliates and Service Providers may host our Site, analyze data collected from our Site, provide customer services on our behalf, administer our promotions, provide marketing or promotional assistance, post our advertisements, and collect your feedback on our Site and advertisements.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregated or de-identified information</strong><br> We may share information in aggregated statistics and de-identified form with third parties, which does not include your Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>When you specifically agree to us sharing your information</strong><br> In some situations, you may specifically agree to us sharing your information.&nbsp; For example, if you provide us with your contact information, e-mail address, Facebook account, or Twitter account for the purposes of signing up for information or marketing offers from an Affiliate, Service Provider or other third party, we may share your Personal Information for that purpose.&nbsp; Your Personal Information will be subject to the privacy policy and business practices of our Affiliate, Service Provider or other third party.</p>
<p><strong>Business Mergers or Acquisitions</strong><br> We may sell or purchase our shares or assets, or enter into other transactions.&nbsp; If another entity acquires us or all or a portion of our assets or we are involved in a corporate re-organization, merger or amalgamation with another entity, information that we collected from you may be shared with that entity.&nbsp; The information will be shared for the purpose of that entity considering whether to enter into the transaction and also to complete the transaction.&nbsp; Should such a sale or transfer or other transaction occur, we will use reasonable efforts to cause that entity to use your information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the purposes for which the information was originally collected.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other legally required or permitted disclosures</strong><br> We may also disclose your Personal Information in the following circumstances: (a) if such disclosure is necessary for us to receive legal advice; (b) to collect a debt from you; (c) if we are required to disclose your Personal Information in order to comply with any legal obligation or the decision of a judicial authority; (d) if disclosure is requested by an investigatory body, law enforcement official or governmental authority which has lawful authority to request the disclosure of the information in respect of an investigation; (e) if we have reasonable grounds to believe that the information relates to a breach of an agreement or contravention of a law; or (f) where we are otherwise permitted to do so by applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>7. <a name="7"></a>How we store and protect your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We retain your Personal Information to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.&nbsp; We maintain and also require our Service Providers to maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of your Personal Information.&nbsp; For example, we use password protection where appropriate and limit access to staff, employees, Affiliates and Service Providers who need to have access to it for the purposes for which it was collected and who have acknowledged their obligations to protect your Personal Information.&nbsp; When we transfer your Personal Information, we use encryption where appropriate. Please understand, however, that we cannot and do not guarantee the security of your Personal Information.</p>
<p>If you are located in Canada, please be aware that information we collect may be transferred to and processed in the United States and other countries in which our Affiliates and Service Providers have operations, and will be subject to the laws of those jurisdictions, which may be different from Canada’s laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p><up><strong>8. <a name="8"></a>Links to external content </strong></up></p>
<p>Our Site may link or direct you to other websites, services or external content resources which are outside of our control. &nbsp;Once you have left our Site, we cannot safeguard and are not responsible for the protection and privacy of any Personal Information which you provide on other websites. &nbsp;These other websites may send their own cookies to your device and may independently collect data or solicit Personal Information.&nbsp; Please review the applicable terms of use and privacy policies for those other websites.</p>
<p><strong>9. <a name="9"></a>Cookies, advertising and how to opt-out</strong></p>
<p>We, or our third-party advertising Service Providers, may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies.&nbsp; We use these technologies to gather statistical information such as your use of our Site, and whether you have opened e-mail advertising from us, and for other marketing purposes, including delivering advertising to you.</p>
<p>If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject any cookies.&nbsp; You may also set your e-mail options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our e-mail and performed certain functions with it.</p>
<p>You may also opt-out of network advertising programs that track your activities across multiple websites to deliver personalized advertising content to you.&nbsp; Please visit <a href="http://youradchoices.ca/understanding-online-advertising" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada Opt-Out Page</a>, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">NAI Opt-Out Page</a> and the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">Ad Choices Opt-Out Page</a>.<br> These websites provide tools that identify member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides mechanisms to opt-out of those cookies.&nbsp; You will still receive other types of advertising from participating companies; however, it will not be based on your interests.&nbsp; Deleting browser cookies can remove your opt-out preferences, so you should use these tools periodically to ensure that your preferences are up-to-date.</p>
<p><strong>10. <a name="10"></a>Accessing your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to verify, correct, or update any of your Personal Information collected by us or our Service Providers or Affiliates acting on our behalf and that we have received from these Service Providers or Affiliates, you may do so by contacting us at the address listed below in “How to Contact Us.”</p>
<p>Please note that we may request Personal Information from you in order to authenticate your identity before providing you with access to your Personal Information or complying with any request to correct or update your Personal Information.&nbsp; <br> Please also note that in some cases we may legally deny you access to the information that we have collected about you.&nbsp; For example, this may occur where the information is subject to solicitor-client privilege or consists of references to other persons or proprietary information that cannot be severed from your information.</p>
<p>We may routinely delete certain records that contain Personal Information in accordance with our record-keeping practices.&nbsp; Although we will make efforts to comply with any request that you may make to destroy Personal Information about you that is not otherwise required by us to fulfill legal requirements or to protect our interests, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your Personal Information from our databases without some residual copies of data because of back-ups, archival systems and other reasons.&nbsp; We will not, however, continue to use your Personal Information for active purposes once you have requested us not to do so.</p>
