<p>(Last updated June 1, 2009)<br>Landmark Cinemas of Canada Inc. respects the privacy of all of its users and is committed to protecting such privacy in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy explains Landmark Cinemas of Canada Inc. and its subsidiaries’ (collectively, "Landmark Cinemas") treatment of your personally identifiable information collected in connection with your activities on or related to all Landmark Cinemas websites referencing this Privacy Policy (the "Landmark Cinemas Sites") and all services made available on the Landmark Cinemas Sites (collectively, unless noted otherwise, the "Landmark Cinemas Services"). This Privacy Policy also explains how you can ask questions and make suggestions about our privacy practices and review and update your personal information.<br>We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully and to check back periodically as this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies or websites which are not owned or controlled by Landmark Cinemas.</p>
<p><br>INFORMATION COLLECTED<br>In the course of operating the Landmark Cinemas Services, we may collect two types of information about our users: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.<br>"Personal Information" is personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, birth date and gender. Personal Information is collected by us when you choose to provide it to us when registering for a Landmark Cinemas Service, such as when you choose to subscribe to a Landmark Cinemas Service, enter a Landmark Cinemas promotion or choose to receive a Landmark Cinemas newsletter. In addition, if you choose to contact any of our customer service representatives, we may keep a record of that correspondence so that we may fully address the subject matter. We may also receive Personal Information from our business partners and other third parties, provided that such third parties confirm to us that you have permitted them to share such information.<br>Business contact information such as the name, title, business address, email address or telephone number of a business or professional person or an employee of an organization is not considered Personal Information.<br>"Non-Personal Information" is information of an anonymous nature, such as your Internet Protocol Address (IP Address), the domain you may have used to access a Landmark Cinemas Service, the type and version of browser or operating system you may be using, and the website you may have come from and visit next. Aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors and average time spent on a Landmark Cinemas Service, is also considered Non-Personal Information.<br>Non-Personal Information is collected or derived by us in the course of operating the Landmark Cinemas Services. For example, our Web servers may automatically collect Non- Personal Information which is provided through your browser or stored on a Cookie (as defined herein) when you choose to visit a Landmark Cinemas Service. Non-Personal Information is used by Landmark Cinemas as described in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION<br>Personal Information may be used by us for the following purposes:<br>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Providing you with the Landmark Cinemas Services and information you have requested from us, including your use of the Landmark Cinemas Sites. We may from time to time use your Personal Information to contact you about changes, enhancements or similar notices related to the Landmark Cinemas Services;<br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you indicated that you were interested in receiving offers or information from Landmark Cinemas or certain of our selected sponsors or advertisers, Landmark Cinemas may send you email materials and other mailings about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you.

<p><br>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION<br>We will not sell or rent your Personal Information to anyone. <br>We will only disclose your Personal Information to third parties:<br>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Where you have specifically given us your consent to disclose your Personal Information for a designated purpose;<br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Who are acting on our behalf as our agents, suppliers or service providers, solely to enable us to more efficiently provide you with the Landmark Cinemas Services. Such entities act under strict contractual controls, requiring them to maintain the confidentiality of all such Personal Information and to use such information solely for purposes related to the provision of the Landmark Cinemas Services;<br>c.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As may be set out in the Terms and Conditions applicable to a Landmark Cinemas Service, to facilitate the provision of such Landmark Cinemas Service, such as fulfilling legal requirements;<br>d.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As required by law, including by an order of any court, institution or body with jurisdiction or authority to compel the production of information, or in order to protect or defend a legal interest; or<br>e.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In connection with a Landmark Cinemas corporate re-organization, merger or amalgamation with another entity, or a sale of all or a substantial portion of the assets of Landmark Cinemas provided that the Personal Information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring the information.<br><br><br>LINKS TO OTHER SITES AND ADVERTISEMENTS<br>A Landmark Cinemas Service may contain links to other websites and services. While we try to link only to sites and services that share our high standards and respect for privacy, please understand that we are not responsible for the content of, or the privacy practices employed by, other companies or websites.

Landmark Cinemas takes technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect Personal Information that you provide to us. We instruct our employees with access to your Personal Information that it is to be used only in adherence with the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy and the laws applicable to each specific business.<br>In certain areas, such as when you provide credit card information to us, we work to help protect the security of your credit card information during transmission by using industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.<br>You can help protect the security of your Personal Information as well. For instance, never give out your password, since this is what is used to access your account or registration information.

In such case we may disclose to those third-party sponsors and advertisers the overall aggregate demographics available regarding, for example who participated in a contest or who saw and "clicked" on an advertisement. No Personal Information will be disclosed to these sponsors and advertisers as part of this process; only information in an anonymous, aggregate form will be disclosed.</p>

This information helps us to better understand when to update, change or offer new services and provides us with details as to the performance of third party advertisements and content. This information may be reported, in aggregate form only, to our current and prospective sponsors, advertisers and business partners. No Personal Information will be disclosed in such reports;<br>c.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Displaying advertisements. Landmark Cinemas and third party advertising providers used by Landmark Cinemas may use Cookies when serving advertisements.<br>Cookies are used on many major web sites.
