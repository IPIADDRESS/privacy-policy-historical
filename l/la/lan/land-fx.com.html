					Our goal is to maintain your trust and confidence when handling personal information about you. <br>
YOU HAVE CHOICES As a LandFX customer, you have the opportunity to make choices about how personal information <br>
about you may be shared. As you consider this, we encourage you to make choices that enable us to provide you with <br>
quality products and services that help you meet your financial needs and objectives.<br><br>

SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION <br>
The security of personal information about you is our priority. We protect this information by maintaining physical, <br>
electronic, and procedural safeguards that meet applicable law. We train our employees in the proper handling of <br>
personal information. When we use other companies to provide services for us, we require them to protect the <br>
confidentiality of personal information they receive. <br>
LandFX Privacy Statement<br>
Our Online Privacy Statement describes how we may collect, use and share information you provide when you visit this <br>
website, receive our emails or interact with advertisements we have on third-party websites.<br><br>

We encourage you to read the privacy policies on these sites. <br>
What Information Do We Collect? <br>
How Do We Use the Information We Collect?<br>
How Do We Use Information From Our Advertisements on Other Websites? <br>
Can You Control Your Information That's Collected and Used Online?<br><br>

1. What Information Do We Collect<br><br>

We collect two types of online information: non-personal and personal.<br><br>

Non-Personal Information<br><br>

When you visit our site, we collect the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. In addition, we <br>
gather information such as what browser and which version of it you're using, the type of operating system you have,<br>
 and which site you came from. This information helps us provide an online experience that matches your device.<br><br>

When you browse our site or receive one of our emails, LandFX and companies we work with, use cookies and/or pixel <br>
tags to collect information and store your online preferences. Cookies are widely used and most browsers are set up to <br>
accept them automatically. If you would prefer, you can choose to not accept cookies.<br><br>

It's important to note that cookies and pixel tags do not capture any information that can personally identify you. The <br>
information they gather helps us improve your online experience and may include: <br><br>

Your response to one of our emails <br>
Time and duration of your visit to our site <br>
Pages you viewed while on our site <br>
We may also supplement the information we collect with information we receive from other companies. For example, <br>
we may use marketing segments developed by us or other companies to customize certain services to your local area <br>
and provide relevant LandFX offers tailored to you.<br><br>

Personal Information<br><br>

In addition to the information described in the previous section, we may also gather personal information that you <br>
provide to us such as your name, address, phone number, and email. Collecting this personal information enables us to <br>
offer you online experiences that help you with your financial needs. For example, we collect personal information <br>
when you are: <br>
Banking online <br>
Applying for a new program or account <br>
If you've enrolled in LandFX services, such as online bill payment, we collect personal information about your transactions, <br>
and how you interact with third parties such as those you pay like a utility company or phone company. <br>
Collecting this information enables us to provide you these services. You can refer to the terms and conditions for your <br>
account or service to learn how your information is collected and used.<br><br>

If we have personal information from you, or information that's publicly available from other sources, we may use it in <br>
combination with the information that LandFX has collected online. We can use this information to better tailor and <br>
personalize our service and marketing communications with you, both online and offline.<br><br>

The personal information you provide online is held by the LandFX business that maintains your account or is processing <br>
your application for a new product or service. You can access and/or change information in connection with your account <br>
or application by logging on to your account online or telephoning customer service.<br><br>

2. How Do We Use the Information We Collect?<br><br>

LandFX uses the information we collect about and from you to manage our business and to offer an enhanced, <br>
personalized online experience on our site and third-party websites.<br><br>

The information we collect allows us to: <br>
Recognize you when you return to our site so we can personalize your experience <br>
Process applications and transactions <br>
Respond to your requests <br>
Provide you relevant product and service offers on our site and in other advertising <br><br>

3. How Do We Use Information from Our Advertisements on Other Websites?<br><br>

Companies we work with place and track advertisements on third-party websites.<br>
Like most advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to customers. <br>
We place advertisements by developing and using our own marketing segments that may combine online and offline <br>
information about our current and prospective customers. In addition, we may use marketing segments provided by <br>
online publishers and network advertising companies.<br><br>

Network advertising companies that provide these services have their own privacy policies and are not subject to our <br>
Online Privacy Statement. Many of these companies provide ways to avoid targeted advertising provided by, or thru, <br>
them.<br><br>

4. Can You Control Your Information That's Collected and Used Online?<br><br>

It's important to note that the information we use about you helps us provide you with products, services and <br>
experiences that benefit you. You have the ability to control how your non-personal information is collected and used <br>
online.<br><br>

Cookies<br><br>

You can control whether to accept cookies or not. If you decide to not accept cookies, some features and services on <br>
our site may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your LandFX account(s).<br>
In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.<br><br>

If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can: Change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, <br>
which lets you choose whether or not to accept it Set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies Targeted <br>
Advertising<br><br>

If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt out of some network advertising programs that use your <br>
information. <br>
To do so please visit the NAI Opt-Out Page. Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), <br>
you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant <br>
to you and your interests.<br><br>

Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have <br>
compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted <br>
advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have <br>
cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.<br><br>

Notice of changes.<br>
From time to time, we may change this Online Privacy Policy. The effective date of this policy, as stated below, indicates <br>
the last time this policy was revised or materially changed. Checking the effective date below allows you to determine <br>
whether there have been changes since the last time you reviewed the policy.<br><br>
