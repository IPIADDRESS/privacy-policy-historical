<p>The purpose of this privacy policy is to describe the types of information that we collect from you when you visit our site and explain how we use this information. </p>

<p>Due to the international nature of Jaguar Land Rover’s business, Jaguar Land Rover processes and stores personal data outside the EU. We are obliged to ask you to agree to this. If you do not wish to, unfortunately we will not be able to process any request you make through this website. </p>

<p>If you do agree, you may do so on the basis either that we use your data ONLY to process the request you make, or that Jaguar Land Rover can make further use for further contacts (always subject to the Privacy Policy below). </p>

<h3>DATA PROTECTION</h3>

<p>We protect the data in strict accordance with the Principles of the European Union Data Protection Framework Directives, in particular EU Directive 95/46/EC</p>

<p>Any information that you choose to provide us with about yourself will be held on a secure computer server in the United Kingdom. The server software (SSL) encrypts all the information you supply us. </p>

<p>This ensures, among other things, that data we hold about you is processed lawfully and fairly. We aim to ensure that the personal data stored will be accurate, relevant and not excessive. We will keep the data up to date and not retain the information longer than is necessary. We will keep data securely to prevent unauthorised access by other people. You have the right to see what is held about you and correct any inaccuracies. </p>

<p>Jaguar Land Rover will not share or loan any identifiable information about you to any third party without your consent. We may share generalised information about site visitor patterns with partners or other parties in such a way that individual visitors can never be identified. It is possible to view our site without providing any personal details. However, without registering your details you will not be able to receive further communications from us. </p>

<h3>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED</h3>

<p>We collect your personal information on a registration form. <br>
This information may include data such as your name, email address, country and preferred language. </p>

<p>We use this information: <br>
To help make your visit more enjoyable<br>
To send you relevant information about products and services<br>
To email you from time to time about promotions or products and services which we think may be of interest to you</p>

<p>If you choose to receive information or other communications from us, you can select that option by ticking the relevant box on the registration form. You can also contact us at any time if you don't want to receive any more communications from us by using the Contact Us link on the website. </p>

<p>If you have allowed us to use your personal information for the purposes above, we may from time to time disclose this information to any company or organisation to which we pass the responsibility to handle email or other direct marketing communications on our behalf. Should this happen, we ensure that any third party companies who handle your information comply with the relevant Data Protection legislation. </p>

<p>Whenever you browse the <a href="http://www.jaguar.co.uk">www.jaguar.co.uk</a> website, read pages, or download information, our computers automatically record certain information about your visit from the computer you use to access our site. </p>

<p>The information includes the following: </p>

<p>This information does not identify you personally. It just tells us how many visitors come to our site and the types of computers they use. With this information, we can improve our site for all our visitors and make it more useful to you </p>

<p>The date and time you access our site.<br>
How many and which pages you visit during a 'session' on our site and how long you were on the site.<br>
Your Internet domain name (this might be your internet service provider such as aol.com or your place of work) and the 'IP' address (this is a number assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web) which allows you to access our website.<br>
The Internet browser you use (e.g. Microsoft Explorer or Netscape) and your computer's operating system (e.g. Windows 98).<br>

A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, we may use "format sensing" technology, which allows pixel tags to let us know whether you received and opened our e-mail. </p>

<h3>MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT PRIVACY?</h3>

<p>You have the right as an individual to find out what information we hold about you and make corrections if necessary. You also have the right to ask us to not use your information for marketing purposes by choosing not to give your consent on the registration form. </p>

<p>If you have any specific questions that are not covered in this section, or want to know what information we currently store on you, please contact us. </p>

<p>If you have a specific data protection concern or complaint, you can address it to our Data Protection &amp; Privacy Team at <a href="mailto:DPOffice@jaguarlandrover.com">DPOffice@jaguarlandrover.com</a><br>
