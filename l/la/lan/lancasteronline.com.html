				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>The information we learn from users helps us personalize and continually improve your experience with our Services.

We will also collect data that can be reasonably linked to a specific consumer, computer or device. For example, we will automatically collect your Internet protocol address (“IP Address”), or a unique device identifiers for mobile devices (“UDID”) when you access our Sites or mobile applications. IP Addresses and UDIDs were traditionally classified as Non-Personal Information because they did not identify a specific individual user. When an IP Address or UDID is associated or linked with other Personal Information, or used to monitor usage, search and transaction history or build a user profile for the purposes of customizing your experience or advertising on our Platforms, such information will be classified as Personal Information to the extent required by applicable law.</p>
<p>Depending on your relationship with us and the Services that you will use, in addition to that more traditional forms of Personal Information, we will also collect your Facebook, Twitter or other social networking user ID and password (and any other Personal and/or Non-Personal Information that you allow Facebook or any other platform to share with us), date of birth, gender, occupation/employer, and purchasing preferences, photos/videos or audio clips of you, facsimile number, and geolocation data that will tell us your specific or general location. We also collect Personal Information offline via contests or other promotions conducted via telephone (such as contests and promotions that encourage you to call in to our radio programs), text and instant messaging, postal mail, or facsimile, and in person at events, concerts, fairs, retail locations, and other remote locations.

Non-Personal Information includes information about your computer, browser, mobile device, visits to our Services and other online activities that are used for internal operations, to enhance or customize your experience, and to improve our Services. Personal Information that is de-identified (meaning it becomes anonymous) and combined with other users’ anonymous Personal Information (also called “aggregated” information) is also Non-Personal information because it cannot be used to identify a specific individual. However, Non-Personal Information linked to or associated with Personal Information will also be classified as Personal Information.</p>

					<p>Our goal is to provide you with ads that are relevant to you. Advertising enables us to provide the rich content for which our sites are known. Often our ads are based on the content of pages you are viewing, but we also provide ads tailored to your interests. Our hope is that by presenting ads tailored to your interests, we will enhance your experience across our diverse websites.</p>
<p>Google is one of the companies that serve advertisements onto our sites. It uses the DFP cookie to serve ads based on your visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DFP cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.</p>
<p>Your access to our websites should not be affected if you do not accept cookies served by third parties.</p>
<p>We use third party analytics vendors, including Google, to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of our Sites and viewing of our content. Some of the ads you see on our Sites are customized based on automated predictions about your interests, which predictions are generated from your visits over time and across different websites, using tools such as Google Analytics. This information allows us to create content of greater interest to you and can also be used to serve ads based on your past visits to our Sites. You can opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies, including use by Google, by visiting the Google opt-out page <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">(https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).</a></p>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>You may opt-out of the Google advertising features described above in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>By installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on located at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/, </a></li>
<li>By using your browser’s Do Not Track (DNT) settings to indicate that you do not wish to receive targeted advertising based on your overall internet usage.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information about DNT and how it works, please visit the Future of Privacy Forum’s website: <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/">http://www.allaboutdnt.com/.</a></p>
<p>We will make a good faith reasonable effort to honor your DNT browser settings for opting out of receiving targeted third party advertising based on your overall Internet usage.

					<p>Although people of all ages may visit our Site and other Services and participate in activities that do not require the collection of Personal Information, we do not knowingly or intentionally collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13, and in some cases (as specified on the home page of the Site) we discourage participation by anyone under the age of 18. Except for the limited circumstances listed below, we will automatically reject and delete (to the extent technically feasible) the registration or entry of any person we believe in good faith to be underage unless such information meets an exception under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) or pertains to the programming or operations of Site. Online or offline correspondence from children that pertains to the programming or operations of Site is subject to Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulations that require broadcast licenses to post such correspondence in the applicable Site’s FCC Public Inspection File. We retain the right to block out or edit the postal and email address, text number and/or name of the child. Except to meet FCC regulations, other applicable laws, or other regulatory and legal purposes, we will not knowingly use, distribute or disclose any child’s Personal Information to third parties without prior parental consent.</p>
<p>Any false or fraudulent registration or entry from a minor (a person under the age of 18) will be deemed to be ineligible and will disqualify the minor from the receipt of a prize, benefit, or other participation. Unless we are required to retain a minor’s Personal Information for regulatory, tax or other legal purposes, we will promptly remove such information from our database (to the extent technically feasible) if a parent withdraws his or her consent to our use of the minor’s Personal Information.</p>
