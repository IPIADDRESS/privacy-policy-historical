    <strong>Shared information:</strong><br><br>
    We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties.<br><br>
    These companies are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide these services to us.<br><br>
    Though Land And Farm makes every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request served on our website and to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.<br><br>
    Land And Farm shares member information in the following areas on the site: Listing Service, Email Alerts and Professional Directory. When a member enters a sale or lease listing in the Listing Service, listing contact information is also entered. During this process, the listing submitter is able to view other members' contact information when he adds another contact beside himself to the listing. In addition, members searching Land And Farm can view contact information (name, email and phone number) when they view a property listing profile. Land And Farm allows users to share contact information with one another via its Email Alerts service. With Email Alerts users can save their property search criteria to have information about properties that match the specified criteria emailed to them. When selecting this service, users are given the option of releasing their contact information to other users who have property listings that match their criteria. This contact information is then shared with the users who have property listings that match the buying or leasing criteria. Unless required by law as detailed in this section or a user specifically takes action as discussed in this paragraph, Land And Farm does not share individual user search activity information and such activity information remains private to the individual user and to Land And Farm. Directory profile users agree to share their contact information and allow all Land And Farm users to view their contact information via the Land And Farm Professional Directory or via links made available to users on a listing or in an email. Land And Farm users who do not opt out of the Professional Directory service during registration with Land And Farm (or anytime thereafter) also agree to share their contact information via the Land And Farm Professional Directory.<br><br>
    Land And Farm shares information with its partners for the purpose of providing related services in which we deem our users have interest. The use that Land And Farm's partners make of customer information will not exceed Land And Farm's use of the data. Key billing information (such as credit card number, expiration date and dollar amount) gathered from users making online purchases of products or services is shared with VeriSign, our credit card processing partner, in order to authorize charges to the credit card. Land And Farm also uses third party providers to perform email and postal mailings on behalf of Land And Farm, but this information (such as name, address and email) is confidential and is not used by the provider for any other purpose.<br><br>
    Land And Farm does not rent or lease user information to any third party, except as disclosed here. From time to time, Land And Farm may obtain information (such as electronic mail addresses) from third party providers. It is our goal to only contact individuals who we believe may have a legitimate business interest in Land And Farm based on their membership or participation in other organizations or web sites, and who have indicated a willingness to be contacted for this purpose. While Land And Farm endeavors to work with other sites and companies with a similar respect for user privacy, Land And Farm cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites.<br><br>
    Please be aware that in the event Land And Farm merges with a third party, or in the event all or substantially all of Land And Farm's assets are acquired by a third party, customer information, including personal information, will be shared and/or transferred to such third party. The information may only be used or shared by such third parties for the primary purpose for which the information was originally collected. If such third parties, or if Land And Farm for its own business needs, desire to use the personal information for another purpose, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information prior to the information being used for a new purpose, and you will have the opportunity to opt out of such new use of your personal information.<br><br>
    <strong>Security of personal information:</strong><br><br>
    Land And Farm's clients and their personal information are considered to be Land And Farm's greatest asset and thus their privacy is treated with the utmost regard and respect. Land And Farm takes every reasonable precaution to secure personal information within both its computers and its physical premises.<br><br>
    The security of your personal information is important to Land And Farm. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). [To learn more about SSL, follow this link <a href="http://www.verisign.com/" target="_blank">http://www.verisign.com</a>].<br><br>
    We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br><br>
