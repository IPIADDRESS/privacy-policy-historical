                </strong>Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the
                highest-quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with
                our clients and partners. The Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we
                collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in
                making informed decisions when using LandWatch.com and our services. This statement will
                be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers'
                needs. </font></small></p>
                <p><small><font face="Arial"><strong>What Information Do We Collect? <br>
                </strong>When you visit LandWatch.com you may provide two types of information: personal
                information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and
                Web site use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse
                LandWatch.com. </font></small></p>
                <p><strong><font face="Arial">1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide</font></strong></p>
                <p><small><font face="Arial"><strong>Email Information <br>
                </strong>In addition to providing the foregoing information to our partners, if you choose
                to correspond further with us through email, we may retain the content of your email
                messages together with your email address and our responses. We provide the same
                protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of
                information received by mail and telephone. </font></small></p>
                <p><small><font face="Arial"><strong>2. Web Site Use Information<br>
                </strong>Similar to other commercial Web sites, LandWatch.com utilizes a standard
                technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are
                Cookies?") and Web server logs to collect information about how LandWatch.com.com is
                used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and
                time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at LandWatch.com, and the Web sites visited
                just before and just after LandWatch.com. This information is collected on an aggregate
                basis. None of this information is associated with you as an individual. </font></small></p>
                <p><small><font face="Arial"><strong>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?
                <br>
                </strong>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our
                business activities, providing customer service and making available other products and
                services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the
                information we collect to notify you about important changes to LandWatch.com, new
                services and special offers we think you will find valuable. The lists used to send you
                product and service offers are developed and managed under our traditional corporate
                standards designed to safeguard the security and privacy of our customers' personal
                information. As a customer, you will be given the opportunity, at least once annually, to
                notify us of your desire not to receive these offers. </font></small></p>
                <p><font face="Arial"><strong><small>What Are Cookies? </small></strong><br>
                <small>Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize
                the computer used to access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored
                by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a
                user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by
                the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related
                Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to
                complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online
                experience easier and more personalized. </small></font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial"><small><strong>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies? <br>
                </strong>Jones Lang LaSalle uses Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web
                server logs to gather information about LandWatch.com users' browsing activities, in order
                to constantly improve LandWatch.com and better serve our customers. This information
                assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the most user-friendly manner and to
                continually improve LandWatch.com to better meet the needs of our customers and
                prospective customers. </small></font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial"><small>Cookies help us collect important business and technical
                statistics. The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users to
                LandWatch.com as they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how
                many people visit our LandWatch.com and evaluate LandWatch.com' visitor capacity. Jones
                Lang LaSalle does not use these technologies to capture your individual email address or
                any personally identifying information about you although they do permit us to send
                focused online banner advertisements or other such responses to you. </small></font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial"><small><strong>Sharing Information with Affiliates <br>
                </strong>From time to time you may notice offers from outside companies advertised on
                LandWatch.com. We take measures to select product or service providers that we believe are
                responsible and afford privacy protections to their customers. However, we cannot make any
                representations or warranties about the practices and policies of these companies. </small></font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial"><small><strong>Sharing Information with Strategic Partners <br>
                </strong>Jones Lang LaSalle may enter into strategic marketing alliances or partnerships
                with third parties who may be given access to personal information including your name,
                address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing you information regarding
                products and services that we think will be of interest to you. In connection with
                strategic marketing alliances or partnerships, we will retain all ownership rights to the
                information, and we will not share information regarding your social security number or
                other personal financial data. </small></font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial"><small><strong>Notice of New Services and Changes <br>
                </strong>Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about
                important changes to our LandWatch.com, new services and special offers we think you will
                find valuable. As our client, you will be given the opportunity to notify us of your
                desire not to receive these offers by clicking on a response box when you receive such an
                offer or by sending us an email request at <a href="mailto:info@LandWatch.com">info@LandWatch.com</a>.

                <p><font face="Arial"><small>Employee Access, Training and Expectations. Our corporate
                values, ethical standards, policies and practices are designed to protect customer
