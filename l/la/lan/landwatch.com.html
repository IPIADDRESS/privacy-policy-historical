                            your email messages together with your email address and our responses. We provide

                        <strong>2. Web Site Use Information<br>
                        </strong>Similar to other commercial Web sites, LandWatch.com utilizes a standard technology
                            called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?")
                            and Web server logs to collect information about how LandWatch.com is used. Information
                            gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits,
                            the pages viewed, time spent at LandWatch.com, and the Web sites visited just before
                            and just after LandWatch.com. This information is collected on an aggregate basis.
                            None of this information is associated with you as an individual.

                            <br>
                        </strong>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering
                            our business activities, providing customer service and making available other products
                            and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also
                            use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to LandWatch.com,
                            new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. The lists used
                            to send you product and service offers are developed and managed under our traditional
                            corporate standards designed to safeguard the security and privacy of our customers'
                            personal information. As a customer, you will be given the opportunity, at least
                            once annually, to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers.

                        <strong>What Are Cookies? </strong>
                            <br>
                            Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize
                                the computer used to access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are
                                stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can remember what
                                information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions
                                with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the
                                user's transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move
                                from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet.
                                Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.

                            <br>
                        </strong>LandWatch.com uses Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web

                            in order to constantly improve LandWatch.com and better serve our customers. This
                            information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the most user-friendly
                            manner and to continually improve LandWatch.com to better meet the needs of our

                        Cookies help us collect important business and technical statistics.
                            The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users to LandWatch.com
                            as they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how many
                            people visit LandWatch.com and evaluate LandWatch.com's visitor capacity. LandWatch.com
                            does not use these technologies to capture your individual email address or any
                            personally identifying information about you although they do permit us to send
                            focused online banner advertisements or other such responses to you.
