    <div>Effective Date: Feb. 16, 2016.&nbsp;This Web site, <a href="http://www.landolakesinc.com/">http://www.landolakesinc.com</a>, is owned and operated by Land O’Lakes, Inc.<br>
<br>
We know that your privacy is important to you, and we work hard to earn and keep your trust. We have created this Policy to let you know what Personal Information we collect when you use this Site, how we use and share the Personal Information we collect, and how we protect your privacy.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions about this Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:Privacy@landolakes.com">Privacy@landolakes.com</a>.<br>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li><strong>Definitions</strong></li>
</ol>
<em>The terms “Land O’Lakes,” “we,” “us,” and “our”</em> refer to&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 20.8px;">Land O'Lakes Inc.</span><br>
<em>The term “Personal Information”</em> refers to information that identifies you personally, alone or in combination with other information available to us. Examples of Personal Information include your name, address, and e-mail address.<br>
<em>The term “Policy”</em> refers to this online privacy policy.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
References to this “Site” refer to the Web site owned by&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 20.8px;">Land O'Lakes Inc.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<em>The term “User-Generated Content” </em>refers to all of the text, photographs, images, illustrations, graphics, sounds, video, audio-video clips, and other content you post on or through this Site. One way that User-Generated Content differs from other information you provide to us is that, once submitted, User-Generated Content is made available instantaneously to others who visit this Site. Examples of User-Generated Content include comments posted to discussion boards and reviews of products available on this Site.<br>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li value="2"><strong>Your Consent</strong></li>
</ol>
Please take a few minutes to review this Policy before using this Site. By using this Site you are consenting to the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information as set forth in this Policy. If you do not agree to be bound by this Policy, you may not continue to access or use this Site.<br>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li value="3"><strong>This Policy is Part of Our Terms of Use</strong></li>
</ol>
This Policy is part of the Terms of Use <a href="http://www.landolakesinc.com/Privacy-Policy">http://www.landolakesinc.com/Privacy-Policy</a>&nbsp;that govern your use of this Site.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
4.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Privacy Notices</strong><br>
This Policy may be amended from time to time by “privacy notices” posted on this Site. These privacy notices provide a level of detail that we cannot provide in this more general description of our privacy practices. For example, certain pages of this Site may contain privacy notices providing details about the Personal Information we collect on those pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information.<br>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li value="5"><strong>Other Agreements</strong></li>
</ol>
When you sign up to use a special feature of this Site, you may be asked to agree to special terms governing your use of the special feature. In such cases, you may be asked to expressly consent to the special terms, for example, by checking a box or clicking on a button marked “I agree.” This type of agreement is known as a “click-through” agreement. If any of the terms of the click-through agreement are different than the terms of this Policy, the terms of the click-through agreement will supplement or amend this Policy, but only with respect to the matters governed by the “click-through agreement.”<br>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li value="6"><strong>Types of Personal Information We Collect</strong></li>
</ol>
<em>Information You Volunteer</em>. Land O’Lakes collects the Personal Information you and others knowingly and voluntarily provide when you use this Site. For example, we collect the Personal Information you provide when you subscribe to one of our newsletters, review or comment on one of our products, or contact us with questions. Some of the information you post to this Site may constitute User-Generated Content. All User-Generated Content must comply with our terms outlined in Section 7 of the Privacy Policy.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<em>Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser</em>. We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your Web browser. This information typically includes your IP address, the identity of your Internet service provider, the name and version of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages you visit. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings. Generally, we do not link the information provided by your browser to your Personal Information.<br>
<br>
<em>More About IP Addresses</em>. An “IP address” is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. It is used to identify your computer’s “location” in cyberspace, so that the information you request can be delivered to you. If you use a dial-up connection or a connection that assigns dynamic IP addresses, your computer will be assigned a new IP address each time you connect to the Internet. If, however, your computer is permanently connected to the Internet using a static IP address, the IP address assigned to your computer will generally be the same each time you use your computer.<br>
<br>
If you have registered with this Site, we may link your IP address to account information that identifies you personally. We may also provide your IP address to our third-party service provider who can use it to identify your state and zip code. This gives us valuable demographic information about the individuals who use this Site. In addition, if, we suspect fraud or a threat to the security of this Site, we may share our server logs—which contain users’ IP addresses—with the appropriate investigative authorities, who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.<br>
<br>
<em>Cookies and Similar Technologies</em>. We use “cookies” and other Web technologies to collect information and support certain features of this Site. For example, we may use these technologies to:

<ul>
	<li>Collect information about the ways visitors use this Site—which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page;</li>
	<li>Support the features and functionality of this Site—for example, to save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database or to prompt the settings you established on previous visits; and</li>
	<li>Personalize your experience when you use this Site.</li>
</ul>
Generally, the information we collect using these Web technologies does not identify you personally. If, however, you have created a user identity, for example, by registering with this Site, we may link the information we collect using these Web technologies to other information that identifies you personally.<br>
<br>
In addition to the cookies Land O’Lakes delivers to your computer, our partners may use cookies. For example, our partners may deliver cookies through this Site or via e-mail that allow them to recognize you in future Web sessions as someone who has expressed an interest in this Site or in our products or services. Likewise, links in e-mails sent to you by our partners may be designed so that we can identify recipients who click on them and/or measure the effectiveness of the e-mail campaign. Cookies delivered by our partners do not identify you personally. They are used to help the Web sites you visit understand your interests and to customize the content of the content presented to you.<strong> </strong>The expiration durations of cookies delivered by our partners vary and are set by our partners.<br>
<br>
Generally, if you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Please note, however, that your browser cannot screen out cookies that are sent by e-mail.<br>
Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit this Site, you may be unable to use all of the functionality of this Site if your browser rejects our cookies.<br>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li value="7"><strong>User-Generated Content</strong></li>
</ol>
The User-Generated Content you submit on or through this Site is available to others who visit this Site. In addition, we may use User-Generated Content you submit on or through this Site in advertising campaigns and other promotions. We may or may not use your name in connection with such use, and we may or may not seek your consent before using the content for such purposes.<br>
<br>
Therefore, you should have no expectation of privacy with respect to User-Generated Content you submit on or through this Site. You should not submit any content you do not wish to make available to the general public, and you must take special care to make sure your submissions comply with our Terms of Use. All terms and conditions of our Terms of Use apply to User Generated Content submitted on or through this Site. In particular, your submissions must not violate the privacy or other rights of others.<br>
