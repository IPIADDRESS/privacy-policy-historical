                      Those credit reporting bodies may include that information in reports

                    <p>
                      For example, if you fail to meet your payment obligations to us in
                      relation to consumer credit, or if you commit a serious credit
                      infringement in relation to consumer credit provided by us, we
                      may be entitled to disclose this information to credit reporting bodies.

                                all of these businesses and our suppliers to comply with
                                strict confidentiality requirements and the APPs. If you

                                As is the case throughout the Australian financial services industry
                                (and other major industries), technology allows for services to be
                                provided by different service providers including some that
                                are located overseas. We utilise overseas service providers
                                for some of our activities and to do so may need to disclose
                                personal information to those service providers. We may also
                                disclose such information to other overseas recipients for the
                                purposes listed above when permitted to do so by the Privacy Act.

                                we use high security levels to protect it. These security

                                e-commerce sites and involve the use of 128-bit encryption.
                                The security level of a web page can be viewed by clicking on

                                our advertisement is viewed. This simply allows us to keep track
                                of how many unique visitors we have to our site and from what
                                advertisements they entered.  This then allows us to measure
                                the effectiveness of different advertisements. The privacy
