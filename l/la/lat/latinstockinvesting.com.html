<p>Acamar Global Investments is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and security of personal information about our current and prospective customers. Please note that certain details of this policy may depend on whether you deal with us through an investment professional, directly as an individual investor, or whether Acamar Global provides services to your employer or plan sponsor. The privacy policies of Acamar Global Investments is reviewed annually. Our printed and online notices are then updated to reflect any changes.</p>
<p><b>Acamar Global Investments Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p><b>How and why we obtain personal information </b><br>
Acamar Global takes great care to protect personal information about you and when we use it, we do so with respect for your privacy. We may use personal information about you to service and maintain your account; process transactions in your account; respond to inquiries from you or your representative; develop, offer, and deliver products and services; or to fulfill legal and regulatory requirements. Acamar Global may collect public and non-public personal information about you from any of the following sources:</p>
<p>â¢	You or your representative on applications or forms (for example, name, address, Social Security number, birth date, assets and income)<br>
â¢	You or your employer or plan sponsor if Acamar Global provides them with recordkeeping services (for example, payroll, human resources, or benefits information)<br>
â¢	Transactional activity in your account (for example, trading history and balances)<br>
â¢	Other interactions with Acamar Global (for example, discussions with our customer service staff or information you enter into our websites)<br>
â¢	Information from consumer reporting agencies (for example, to assess your creditworthiness for margin products)<br>
â¢	Information from other third-party data services (for example, to verify your identity and to better understand your product and service needs)<br>
â¢	You or your representative regarding your preferences (for example, your choice of electronic statement delivery, or the screen layout you specify if you use our Internet sites)<br>
â¢	Other sources with your consent or with the consent of your representative (for example, from other institutions if you transfer positions into Acamar Global)</p>
<p><b>How we protect information about you </b></p>
<p>Acamar Global considers the protection of personal information to be a foundation of customer trust and a sound business practice. We employ physical, electronic and procedural controls and we regularly adapt these controls to respond to changing requirements and advances in technology. At Acamar Global, we restrict access to personal information to those who require it to develop, support, offer and deliver products and services to you.</p>
<p><b>How we share information about you with third parties </b></p>
<p>Acamar Global does not share personal information about our customers with unaffiliated third parties for use in marketing their products and services. We may share personal information with the following entities:</p>
<p>â¢	Unaffiliated service providers (for example, printing and mailing companies, securities clearinghouses, marketing service providers, and other entities who may provide services at Acamar Global's direction)<br>
â¢	Government agencies, other regulatory bodies and law enforcement officials (for example, for tax purposes or for reporting suspicious transactions)<br>
â¢	Other organizations, with your consent or as directed by your representative (for example, if you use Acamar Global as a financial reference in applying for credit with another institution), or as permitted or required by law (for example, for fraud prevention)</p>
<p>Our service providers are obligated to keep the personal information we share with them confidential and use it only to provide services specified by Acamar Global. </p>
<p>Based on the nature of your relationship with Acamar Global, we may exchange information with other third parties as described below:</p>
<p>â¢	If Acamar Global provides workplace services to your employer or plan sponsor, such as payroll, human resources or benefits recordkeeping services, Acamar Global may exchange any information received in connection with such services with your employer or plan sponsor or others they may authorize.<br>
â¢	If you conduct business with Acamar Global through your investment professional, we may exchange information we collect with your investment professional or with others they may authorize.</p>
<p><b>Privacy online </b></p>
<p>Privacy, security, and service in Acamar Global's online operations are just as critical as in the rest of our business. We use firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of your online session and to protect Acamar Global accounts and systems from unauthorized access.<br>
