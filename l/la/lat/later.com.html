Personal Information that can identify you or any individual person. The areas

you, to provide you with more personalized service and to learn more about our
user demographics and preferences.
</p><p><b>Contests &amp; Promotions</b><br>

level). Contact information is normally used to notify the winners and award
prizes. For other uses of the information, please refer to the specific contest

demographic information for aggregate use. We also track and analyze
click-stream data for the same purposes.
