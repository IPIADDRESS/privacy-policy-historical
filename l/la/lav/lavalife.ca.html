								<h3>How Lavalife Works</h3>
								
								<div class="content">
									<b>How do “likes” work?</b>
									<p>Clicking the heart icon on someone else’s profile in search, mini profile or full profile view shows that specific Lavalife.com user that you’re interested in them, or that you like their profile. You can see the likes that your profile has received by clicking on the heart icon in your notifications bar in the upper right hand corner of the screen. You can unlike someone’s profile at any point by returning to their profile and clicking the heart icon once more, so that it changes back from red to clear.</p>
									
									<b>How do “favorites” work?</b>
									<p>Clicking the star icon on someone else’s profile in search, mini profile or full profile view adds that particular profile to your “Favorites” list. Think of this list as a collection of bookmarked profiles. The person that you’ve added to your list doesn’t know they’ve been added. So, you can keep tabs on your favorite profiles or favorite a few to go back to and read in full later on. Just like “likes”, you can unfavorite a profile by returning to the profile and clicking the star icon once more, so that it changes back from yellow to clear.</p>
									
									<b>How do “views” work?</b>
									<p>The eye icon in your notifications bar shows you a list of other Lavalife.com users who have recently viewed your profile. When you view someone else’s profile, you will appear within their list. This is a handy way to see how popular your profile has been recently and to follow up with anyone you might be interested in.</p>
									
									<b>How do messages work?</b>
									<p>The message center is where all your sent and received messages are stored. The envelope icon in your notifications bar will show you a running total of all new messages received. As you read through your messages, you’ll notice the notification number decreasing until the notifications clear. You can also delete a message, click through to view a user’s full profile and even block a user directly from your message center. </p>
									
									<b>Are there fake profiles on Lavalife.com?</b>
									<p>We never have and never will have fake profiles on Lavalife.com. We believe in connecting real local singles with other real local singles, and that’s what we promise to continue to do. </p>
									
									<b>Is Lavalife.com free?</b>
									<p>It’s always free to join Lavalife.com and to try it for a week. But, after the week, you’ll be notified that your free trial period is up and will be prompted to purchase a monthly subscription membership.</p>
									
									<b>Can I use the same login for Lavalife.com and the Lavalife mobile app?</b>
									<p>Yes! Lavalife.com and the Lavalife mobile app are directly linked, so you can use one set of logins for both platforms. Any changes you make to your profile on the app will also be changed on your Lavalife.com profile and vice versa. Take Lavalife with you on-the-go with our mobile app available for iOS and Android devices.</p>
									
									<b>Another user or his/her profile content is bothering me on Lavalife.com. What can I do?</b>
									<p>We take all user misconduct very seriously and strongly urge you to report and block any harassing or bothersome behavior. Our team of dedicated customer service professionals carefully review and appropriately action any and all flagged profiles, messages and activity as quickly as possible. Your safety is our priority here at Lavalife. Please never hesitate to contact us if we can help make your experience a more enjoyable one.</p>

								<h3>Making the Most out of Lavalife.com</h3>
								
								<div class="content">
									<b>How do I choose the best profile picture?</b>
									<p>A good profile picture can make or break an online dating profile’s success. A general rule is to use a photo taken within the last year and to frame your upper body and face. On the Lavalife blog, we regularly post tips and advice on how to make your Lavalife.com experience the best it can be. <a href="http://blog.lavalife.com/how-to-take-a-great-profile-picture-for-online-dating-social-media-or-anywhere-else/">Click here</a> to read more about how to take a great profile picture.</p>
									
									<b>How do I write a great “About Me”?</b>
									<p>When it comes to writing your “About Me” section, it is important to play up the positives and avoid focusing on the negatives. You also want to be truthful, upfront and put your best self forward. For more tips and advice on how to write a great “About Me,” click <a href="http://blog.lavalife.com/how-to-write-a-good-online-dating-profile-without-stretching-the-truth/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.lavalife.com/5-things-best-online-dating-profiles/">here</a>.</p>
									
									<b>How do I use the search function to find the right profiles for me?</b>
									<p>Seeing too many results at once can be overwhelming, and we understand that! That’s why we offer two ways to narrow down your results. First, use the “Basic Search” to quickly narrow down your search results to see people looking for the same relationship type as you, within your preferred age range and within a specific distance. Then, use the “Advanced Search” to select more specific search criteria that will help comb through results and present you with people who most closely match what you’re looking for.</p>
									
									<b>How do I use the “In Common” feature to break the ice?</b>
									<p>Lavalife.com’s “In Common” feature allows you to see what another user has in common with you straight away, so you can break the ice by sending a message about something you both enjoy. Do you have a specific sport in common? If so, ask about his or her favorite team. Do you both enjoy gourmet cooking? Ask about the last recipe they enjoyed. Our “In Common” feature is all about cutting through the noise and highlighting your common ground faster, helping you to strike up a conversation and get things moving.</p>

							<h1 style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px;">PRIVACY POLICY</h1>						
							<div style="text-align:left;">

								<p>THIS AGREEMENT WAS LAST UPDATED ON AUGUST 13, 2009. </p>

								<p>Lavalife is firmly committed to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website, including the Lavalife®, Manline® and Womanline™ communities. </p>

								<p>The protection of your privacy being very important, we have adopted the following practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. We will notify all registered users via email of any material change to this Privacy Policy, unless you have opted-out of receiving email from us. From time to time, changes to this Privacy Policy will also be communicated on this site.</p>

								<b>What information do you gather automatically from visitors? </b>

								<p>We use your IP address (the series of numbers associated with your individual computer) to help us maintain our site and identify problems with our server. Your IP address does not disclose any personally revealing information about you. </p>

								<p>We do use cookies to identify traffic that comes through advertising and to facilitate a more user friendly experience. Cookies are small pieces of information that a web site places on your computer's hard drive so we know it's you when you visit. This helps us to create a personalized experience for you when you visit our site. The use of cookies is a very common practice on the Internet. If you are uncomfortable with this, you can disable all cookies through your browser settings. Your enjoyment of our site won't be affected if you have set your browser to reject cookies.</p>

								<b>What information will you ask me for? </b>

								<p>When you register to use any Lavalife service you will be asked for some general information, which enables us to provide you with this individualized service. We gather contact information (like your email address), demographic information (like your city of residence or age). We may share some of this information for our own research purposes with our professional advisors or consultants and third party partners, however the information shared will be limited to non-personally identifying demographic information shared under cover of a confidentiality agreement. If you choose to become a Full Member, we collect financial information (like your credit card number and expiry date). We will only use this information in the course of providing our service to you. </p>

								<p>Once you have registered, you will be given the option of creating a pseudonymous profile (nickname and personal description) within any of our communities where your gender is applicable. Depending on which community you choose, you will be asked for some personal but non-identifying information to complete your profile (i.e. whether you have dependants, height, body type, race, religion, whether you smoke, etc.). This information is not linked in any way to your personally identifiable information, for other members to see. Obviously, if you provide us with a photograph or video some of your information may become personally identifiable information.</p>

								<b>How will this information be used and who has access to it? </b>

								<p>If you choose to have them sent to you, we may use your contact information to send you valuable updates and timely notices of promotions and mailbox status reports. Our site provides you with the opportunity to opt-in to receiving different types of communications from us at the point where we request registration information. You may modify this choice at any time by selecting "Preferences" from the member home page. We reserve the right to use your contact information at any time to advise you of any updates that may materially affect your rights or status on our site.</p>

								<p>Your non-personally identifying demographic information is used to personalize your experience, allow other members to find you through a search, allow us to forward you further search results, to compose your personal profile—which is associated with a pseudonymous identity you have created—and to deliver targeted advertising and promotional offers to you from us and from external companies that are of the highest relevance to your demographic profile. Lavalife promotional offers and service information maybe sent to your contact email from time to time as well as to your Lavalife mailbox. In respect of all other promotions, only your Lavalife mailbox, and not your contact email or other contact information may be made available to other members or organizations unless you have initiated or opted in to receive information or emails from the member or organization. </p>

								<p>In the event that you decide to become a Full Member of Lavalife's community, you will be asked for your financial information (like your credit card number) , which cannot be read by others when you initiate your order through a secured system. You will know you are in secure mode when the tiny padlock icon—located at the bottom of your browser—appears "locked.” </p>

								<p>The personally identifiable information we collect from you is used for internet review and to improve the content and functionality of our web server or customize the layout of our pages for each individual member. Additionally, we may, from time to time, use this information to identify other members that fit your search criteria and to contact you with the profiles of those members or to provide other members with your profile. The specific information we collect is not shared with other organizations and we will never release your personally identifiable information to an external organization without your prior consent except for the purposes of validating credit information and collecting debts. We may disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by operation of law, which may include, but is not limited to a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Lavalife.</p>

								<p>Although Lavalife makes use of up-to-date technology in order to protect your pictures and video recordings from being copied or captured by unauthorized third parties, please keep in mind that we cannot ensure complete protection. When we use your pictures in our service or our marketing materials we include the Lavalife logo to serve as notice to third parties not to copy or use the pictures. The presence of this logo, or watermark does not in anyway imply copyright or other proprietary rights in and to the picture by Lavalife and is merely provided to discourage the unauthorized use of the picture.</p>

								<b>How long do you keep the information I've given you? </b>

								<p>We keep the information you have given us for as long as you are a member on the site or for as long as we are required to do so by law, which ever is longer.</p>

								<b>Can I change the information I have already given you?</b> 

								<p>You can always verify or request the removal of the personally identifiable information we have collected and change your registration information by selecting "My Account" from the main menu on the site. </p>

								<p>Any such request may also be made by contacting the Lavalife Privacy Officer at the co-ordinates listed at the bottom of this page.</p>

								<b>Do you monitor online behavior?</b> 

								<p>Our members communicate with each other through instant messages and onsite mail. While we do not, as a rule, moderate or monitor members' private exchanges, we reserve the right to do so if we suspect users of being under 18 or of using our service for the purpose of solicitation or any other violation of our terms of use or Privacy Policy. Member submissions that appear on the public area of the site are moderated and, if necessary, we reserve the right to edit, delete, remove or not use any communication on a public area of the site.</p> 

								<p>Members may choose to participate in community polls. The results of these polls are tracked by gender only and do not reveal any personally identifiable information linked to the individual voters.</p>

								<b>What security features do you have? </b>

								<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is the leading security protocol on the Internet; it ensures that information being transferred over the network is private through a process called encryption. Once encrypted the information is an unintelligible code until it is decoded upon arrival at the authorized destination. </p>

								<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>

								<p>If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at the coordinates listed below.</p>

								<b>Advertisers </b>

								<p>When you inquire about advertising opportunities on our site, you will be asked for contact information and information related to your advertising objectives. This information will be used to provide you with the business information you are seeking. Your information is only shared with internal staff and the external ad representation agencies that sell media space on the site, on our behalf. Lavalife sites may contain links to other sites not affiliated with Lavalife. Please note that these other sites may have privacy policies that differ from those of Lavalife. We have no control over any personal information that you provide to these sites.</p>

								<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/">click here</a>.</p>

								<b>Associates</b> 

								<p>When you register to become an Associate of our site, you will be asked for contact information and information related to your site. Your information will only be used by internal staff and will never be shared with anyone external to the company other than our advisors and representatives without your consent, unless required to do so by operation of law. Your information will be used to secure your approval as an Associate, to facilitate communication between our two sites and to send you payment, based on your site's performance.</p>

								<b>Membership Categories</b>

								<p>Users of the Service may become "Guests," "Free Members" or "Full Members" of the Service.
								Guests are allowed access to a minimal level of the Service's features and are not charged by us for the use of the features they can access.
								Free Members are allowed to access more features of the Service than are Guests, but are not allowed access to all of the features that Full Members are allowed to access. Free Members are not charged by us for the features they can access.
								Full Members are provided with access to additional features of the Service that are not available to Guests or Free Members, but are restricted to certain communities and limited features.</p>

								<b>Fees and Payments</b>

								<p>A Full Member receives a subscription giving access to the "paid features" of the Service in all three communities and certain other features. Members will be able to send unlimited e-mails and instant messages for as long as the Subscription remains active.
								In order to purchase a Subscription, you may make an online charge to a credit card account or pay by cash in accordance with our pricing policy for Subscriptions as posted on the Service from time to time. Prices are exclusive of applicable taxes, if any, including GST and HST. Lavalife will charge and collect sales tax on any purchase made from a Canadian credit card, drawn on a Canadian account and/or from a Canadian location or address (default).  A Subscription is valid for either 30 days from the time of payment (one month package), 90 days (3 month package) or 180 days (6 month package) from the time of payment. Once purchased, and UNLESS CANCELLED, SUBSCRIPTIONS AUTOMATICALLY RENEW either for further 30-day periods, 90-day periods or 180-day periods, as the case may be, and are charged to the credit card originally used to purchase the Subscription. Not all payment options or methods are available in all geographic areas.</p>

								<b>CANCELLATION</b>

								<p>Subscriptions may be cancelled at any time prior to the end of any 30-day period, 90-day period or 180-day period as the case may be, by selecting your reason for cancellation and clicking on the "submit" button within the preferences tab on the account page. Cancellation will be effective as of the next billing date as long as notice is given at least 24 hours prior to the end of the applicable 30, 90, or 180-day period. If your usage of the Service is terminated because of a breach of this Agreement or if it is terminated for any reason, any unused Subscription time is automatically and immediately forfeited. THE PURCHASE OF A SUBSCRIPTION IS NON-REFUNDABLE. Once purchased the Subscription has no monetary value and only entitles you to use of paid features on the Service for the Subscription Period based on your selected subscription package for a period of 30 days, 90 days or 180 days as the case may be. In addition to paying the published price, the purchaser is responsible for paying all applicable taxes in connection with the purchase of the Subscription. We reserve the right to change our pricing policy at any time at our sole discretion. We also reserve the right to change the method of payment which is acceptable to us, at our sole discretion. You agree to pay or have paid all fees and charges incurred in connection with your membership with the Service (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred.
