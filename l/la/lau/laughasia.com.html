                <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
				<br><br>
				
				<p>
				Laughasia respects the privacy concerns of the users of its Internet Sites ("Sites"), and has created this privacy statement to explain what information we gather from your visit to our Sites, and how such information may be used.
<br><br>
				Use of Information
				<br>
As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as your name or address, is automatically collected from your visit to Laughasia. However, certain non-personal information is recorded by the standard operation of Laughasia Internet servers. Information such as the type of browser being used, its operating system, and your IP address is gathered in order to enhance your online experience. For example, it may be used to tailor content and advertising to your interests.
<br>
In special cases, Laughasia may disclose user information when there is reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to, or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with, Laughasia's rights or property, other Laughasia web site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.
<br><br>
Security <br>
Security for all personally identifiable information is extremely important to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information, Laughasia cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online forms, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
<br><br>

When you request pages from Laughasia Sites, our servers log your IP address. Laughasia collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our Site. We may use your IP addresses in cooperation with your Internet provider to identify you if we deem it necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or to protect our service, Sites, customers, or others.
