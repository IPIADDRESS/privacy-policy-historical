<p>COMPANY WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p>Cluster Labs, Inc. (“Company” “we”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our privacy practices (“Privacy Policy”).  By using the Company services, or visiting the Company website at http://launchkit.io (collectively, the “Services”), you accept the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage.  We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.  This Privacy Policy does not information collected via third party mobile applications which utilize Company’s development platform (“Apps”).  </p>
<p>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT?</p>
<p>Information You Provide to Us:</p>
<p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us.  For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for iTunes or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy.  Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.  </p>
<p>We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services.  Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services.  If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the emails. </p>
<p>Information Collected Automatically</p>
<p>Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people.  You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. </p>
<p>We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns.  We may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.   </p>
<p>Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</p>
<p>Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.  Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.  Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different websites.  Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.</p>
<p>HOW DOES COMPANY USE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>
<p>  We only use your Personal Information internally to: (i) provide Services to our customers and (ii) further develop and improve such Services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>WILL COMPANY SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</p>
<p>Personal Information about our end users is an integral part of our business.  We do not rent, sell or disclose your Personal Information to anyone – except for the following limited purposes:</p>
<p>Affiliated Businesses: In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us).  You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</p>
<p>Agents: We may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf - meaning they are helping us provide our Services.  We may share your Personal Information with such companies/persons solely as necessary for them to help us provide the Services.  Unless we tell you differently, Company’s agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>
<p>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.  In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred.  Moreover, if Company, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Company goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.</p>
<p>Protection of Company and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our employees, our users, or others.</p>
<p>With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>
<p>CONDITIONS OF USE</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you decide to access or use the Services, any possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of California state law.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?</p>
<p>You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p>
<p>You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above.  When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.  You may request deletion of your account by going to your account settings.  Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.  </p>
<p>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p>Company may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.  If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by updating this page.  Users are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such notice has been provided.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy in connection with the Services, please send us a detailed message at launchkit@getcluster.com.  We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.</p>
<p>Effective Date: February 12,  2015</p>
