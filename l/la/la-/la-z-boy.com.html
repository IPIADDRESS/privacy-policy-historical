			By visiting la-z-boy.com, you are accepting the practices described in this 
			Privacy Policy. This Policy is subject to change without notice and you should 
			revisit this site frequently for the most current version of our policy.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Our Pledge to You, Our Customer</strong><br>
			La-Z-Boy respects your privacy. We do not sell, rent, loan or transfer any 
			personal information regarding our customers to any unrelated third parties. 
			Any information you give us about yourself is held with the utmost care and 
			security and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented. 
			Information collected on our Web site is used by La-Z-Boy Incorporated, its 
			subsidiaries, affiliates and authorized agents (referred to collectively as 
			“La-Z-Boy”) for La-Z-Boy purposes. La-Z-Boy will not collect any personal 
			information about you except when specifically and knowingly provided by you. 
			Examples of personally identifiable information include full name, home 
			address, e-mail address and phone number. La-Z-Boy will use reasonable efforts 
			to include accurate and up-to-date information on this site. All users agree 
			that all access to and use of this site and its content is at your own risk. 
			La-Z-Boy will not be liable for any damage arising out of your access to, use 
			of, or inability to use this site, or any errors or omissions in the content 
			thereof. The materials in this site are provided without warranties of any 
			kind, either expressed or implied.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Use of Your Information</strong><br>
			Authorized La-Z-Boy employees internally use information collected on our Web 
			site for three main purposes. First, we collect information to figure out how 
			to improve our site by seeing which areas' features and products are most 
			popular. Second, we collect information in order to personalize the site for 
			our customers. For example, in the future, we may recommend products or 
			features you may like based on what you have liked in the past. Last, we 
			collect information to enable customers to participate in sweepstakes, contests 
			and other activities on our Web site. If we collect any such information, we 
			will only collect enough information to enable you to participate in the 
			activity and no more. If we want to collect information for other purposes, we 
			will inform you when we collect the information. Occasionally, La-Z-Boy may 
			also share non-personal, summary information regarding our customers with 
			unrelated third parties (for example, we publicly disclose the aggregate number 
			of registered users of our Web site). However, La-Z-Boy does not share any 
			personal information about any particular customer with unrelated third 
			parties. (We may do so in the unlikely event that we believe we are required to 
			by law or to protect La-Z-Boy, its dealers, or the public.) If you do not want 
			to receive e-mail from us and currently do, please reply to an e-mail that we 
			have sent to you and insert "unsubscribe" in the subject line.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Use of Our Information</strong><br>
			All of the writing on our site is the property of La-Z-Boy and is protected by 
			copyright. None of the material may be reproduced without our written 
			permission, with the exception of downloading or printing a single copy for 
			your offline viewing. Many of the furniture products displayed throughout the 
			pages of this Web site are protected by design patents issued by the United 
			States. These design patents, which are owned by La-Z-Boy, cover one or more of 
			the ornamental or aesthetic features forming the overall furniture product. 
			Design patents may also be pending in the United States and other countries 
			worldwide, which will serve to protect the designs of these furniture products 
			when they are issued by the respective country. These furniture designs are 
			exclusive property of La-Z-Boy and may not be copied, modified, or imitated 
			without the prior written permission of La-Z-Boy. Additionally, many of the 
			furniture products displayed throughout the pages of this Web site are 
			protected by utility patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and 
			patent offices in other countries. These utility patents, which are also owned 
			by La-Z-Boy, cover one or more of the functional features or components of the 
			furniture product, and/or its method of manufacture. Utility patents may also 
			be pending in the United States and other countries which when issued by the 
			respective country will serve to protect a functional feature or manufacturing 
			method. Further information relating to utility patents of La-Z-Boy may be 
			obtained from tags or labels that are attached directly to the bottom of the 
			furniture products themselves. We are certain you understand that La-Z-Boy must 
			protect its intellectual property, including its patents, trademarks, and 
			copyrights. Therefore, no license to La-Z-Boy's intellectual property has been 
			granted by this Internet site.

			<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
			La-Z-Boy uses a feature of your Internet Web browser called a "cookie" to 
			assign a unique identification to your computer. Cookies are files that your 
			Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. We use these cookie files to 
			track your clicks as you go through the La-Z-Boy Web site, to tell us whether 
			you have visited La-Z-Boy previously, and to help us determine whether you came 
			to La-Z-Boy from a particular Internet link or banner advertisement. La-Z-Boy 
			does not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from 
			your computer. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you 
			how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser 
			notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. 
			However, you will not be able to use some la-z-boy.com features if you do not 
			use cookies.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Maintenance Of Accurate Information</strong><br>
			Procedures have been established to ensure that our product and promotional 
			information is current and accurate in keeping with reasonable standards. We 
			are committed to respond to requests to correct inaccurate information in a 
			timely manner.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Third-Party Sites</strong><br>
			Our site contains links to other sites whose information practices and privacy 
			policy may be different from our own. Visitors should consult the other sites' 
			privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, 
			or collected by, these third parties.
