			<p>NetElixir, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate
			our firm commitment to privacy. This privacy statement discloses the
			information collection and disclosure practices for our Web sites (the
			"Sites"). By accessing the Sites, you consent to the collection and use of
			information as described herein. We reserve the right to change this privacy
			statement at any time. If we make any material changes to our privacy
			statement, we will post a new statement on the Sites and update the effective
			date set forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of our
			privacy statement whenever you visit the Sites to see if it has been updated
			since your last visit.</p><br>

            <p><b>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></p><br>

	        <p></p><h2 style="display:inline;"><u>Personal Information</u>.</h2>Our Sites provide advertisers, agencies and
			businesses with various services related to internet marketing, pay per click
			ad campaigns, search engine optimization and other marketing services and
			tools. Our sites provide both free and purchased or licensed tools to help
			improve their business. In order for us
			to provide these services, we may collect your e-mail address as well as
			contact information, including but not limited to your name, company, address, and
			phone number.<p></p><br>

			<p>We may also use a third party to host our Sites, including our online data
			collection forms. This third party provider has access to the user information
			for purposes such as maintaining our Sites.</p><br>

			<p></p><h2><u>Aggregate Information</u>.</h2> Aggregate information is data we collect about
			a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual user
			identities have been removed. We collect aggregate information about you and
			your use of our services and combine it with information about how others use
			the same service. Such aggregate information includes, without limitation, site
			traffic, page views, and impressions. This information may be correlated to you
			for our internal use only. However, we may collect, compile, store, publish,
			promote, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all aggregate information
			(i.e., information that does not personally identify you).<p></p><br>

			<p></p><h2><u>Usage Information</u>.</h2> We may from time to time collect information
			regarding your usage of our free software tools to help you better use the
			tools and gain insights in your marketing efforts. This information is used strictly to
			communicate with you and improve our tools.<p></p><br>

           <p><b>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p><br>

			<p>We use personal information internally to serve our users and to enhance and
			extend our relationship with our users. For example, by understanding how you
			use the Sites or our software from your computer, we are able to customize and
			personalize your experience. More specifically, we use personal information for
			the purposes for which it was collected (such as to provide you with the
			services), to anticipate and resolve problems with our Sites, to respond to
			customer support inquiries, and to send you periodic e-mails or newsletters,
			and for our own internal operations (including internal analysis as described
			below). You should review the following section to understand when we disclose
			personal information to third parties.</p><br>
			
			<p><b>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p><br>

			<p>Except as set forth in this privacy statement, we do not disclose, sell,
			rent, loan, trade or lease any personally identifying information collected at
			our Sites to any third party. We will disclose personal information in the
			following circumstances:</p><br>
				
			<p></p><h2><u>Internal Analysis and Operations</u>.</h2> We may use
			and disclose information about you for our own internal statistical, design or
			operational purposes, such as to estimate our audience size, measure aggregate
			traffic patterns, and understand demographic, user interest, purchasing and
			other trends among our users and to improve our products. We may outsource
			these tasks and disclose personal information about you to third parties,
			provided the use and disclosure of your personal information by these third
			parties is restricted to performance of such tasks. We may also share personal
			information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing internal
			functions necessary to operate our business. We require our third party vendors
			to keep such information confidential and to only use the information for the
			purpose it was provided.<p></p><br>
				
			<p></p><h2><u>Transaction Processing</u>.</h2> We may disclose
			personal information to third parties as necessary to perform services or to
			process transactions for you. We or our service providers may contact you to
			complete the transactions you have requested by any methods available including
			via e-mail, telephone, regular mail or other means. <p></p><br>
				
			<p></p><h2><u>Protection of NetElixir and Others</u>.</h2> We may disclose personal information when we
			believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena,
			warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this privacy statement or our
			other policies or agreements; to protect our or our users rights, property or
			safety; or to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of,
			our Sites.<p></p><br>
				
			<p></p><h2><u>Business Transfers</u>.</h2> In addition, information about users of our
			Sites, including personally identifiable information provided to us by our
			users, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing,
			sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or
			receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred
			to third parties as one of the business assets of the company.<p></p><br>
				
			<h3>LINKS</h3>
				
			<p>Please be aware that we may provide links to third party Web sites from our
			Sites as a service to our users and we are not responsible for the content or
			information collection practices of those sites. We have no ability to control
			the privacy and data collection practices of such sites and the privacy
			policies of such sites may differ from that of our sites. Therefore, we
			encourage you to review and understand the privacy policies of such sites
			before providing them with any information.</p><br>
			
			<h3>COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS</h3>
				
			<p>We may use cookies to identify users and customize their experience on our
			site based on information they give us. Cookies are small pieces of information
			or files that are stored on a user's computer by the Web server through a
			user's browser for record keeping purposes. A cookie itself is not designed or
			intended to read any information from your computer (other than the contents of
			the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the Web site that originally
			placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can
			be retrieved by the same site's Web server in order to personalize, monitor, or
			regulate the use of the site. We do not use Web <span class="GramE">beacons,</span>
			or similar technology on our Sites. However, we may from time to time permit
			third parties to place Web beacons on our Sites to monitor the effectiveness of
			advertising and for other lawful purposes. A Web beacon, also known as a "Web
			bug,
			" is a small, graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or in an
			e-mail message that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to
			monitor who is visiting a site. Web beacons collect non-personally identifying
			information such as the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent
			to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from and the time it was viewed.
			We do not use (or permit third parties to use) Web beacons to collect
			personally identifying information about you.</p><br>
			
			<p></p><h3>SECURITY</h3>
			We use reasonable security measures to store and
			maintain personally identifying information to protect it from loss, misuse,
			alternation or destruction by any unauthorized party while it is under our
			control.<p></p><br>
				
			<p></p><h3>CHILDREN</h3>
			<span class="GramE">We</span> do not intend, and these Sites are not designed, to
			collect personal information from children under the age of 16. If you are
			under 16 years old, you should not register for our services or otherwise
			provide information on our Sites.<p></p><br>
