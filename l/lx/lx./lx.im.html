<br>

have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. When you register we ask for information such as your name and email
address. When you register with MyLikes and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. MyLikes automatically receives and records

MyLikes does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or
services you've requested, when we have your permission, or when we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise
our legal rights or defend against legal claims. If MyLikes becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its
assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<br>
<p>COOKIES<br>

the date and time of each visitor request. MyLikes uses this information to understand how visitors use our website.</p>
<br>
<p>CONTENTS OF ITEMS<br>
<br>
The contents of any item that you post directly to the Site, including any text, images, photos, videos and audio, are stored and maintained on our

<br>
<p>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY<br>
