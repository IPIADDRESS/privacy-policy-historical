                      your needs better, we use "cookies" to store and 
                      sometimes to track user information. A cookie is a small 
                      amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server 
                      and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie contains 
                      a unique number that allows our sites to identify your computer. 
                      For example, cookies allow us to keep track of your user 
                      name and password (if you are a registered visitor) so you 
                      don’t have to re-enter that information each time you visit 
                      our site. We also use cookies to make sure you don’t see 
                      the same ads repeatedly when you visit our sites. The help 
                      function on most browsers contains information on how to 
                      set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies 
                      or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don’t accept 
                      cookies, you won’t be able to take advantage of various 
                      features on our sites that are available to other visitors. 
                      In addition, our advertising and marketing partners may 
                      use their own cookies. We use the services of a third-party 
                      advertising company to serve and target advertisements that 
                      you see on the pages of our sites and to serve and target 
                      promotions or other marketing messages. This advertising 
                      company also collects "clickstream data," information 
                      about your visit to our site and to other sites, that can 
                      be aggregated and used for marketing research and other 
                      similar purposes. This clickstream data does not include 
                      personally identifying information such as your name, address, 
                      email address or telephone number. This advertising company 
                      uses cookies for many of the same reasons we do, and collects 
                      information directly from our users. If you would like to

                      not tell us who you are. Like the IP address, none of this 
                      other information identifies you personally either; we collect 
                      it for aggregate reporting on site activity that we, and 
                      our advertisers, may use. For example, we may want to know
