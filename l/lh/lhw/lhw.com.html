Privacy Policy</b></p> <p>Your privacy is very important to Leading Hotels of the World, Ltd ("we" or "us"). With that in mind, we have established and implemented information handling practices for www.lhw.com ("site") that we believe are consistent with the highest standards and best practices of organizations doing business on the Internet. This privacy policy ("policy") describes the practices that apply to our site, including, specifically, the information we collect about you, when and how we collect that information and what may happen to that information. We have prepared a detailed policy because we believe you should know as much as possible about our practices so that you can make an informed decision about the extent of your use of our site. </p> <p><b>Simply put:</b></p> <ul type="disc"> <li>we will not collect personally identifiable information like your name, e-mail and mailing address and telephone number ("Personal Information") without your knowledge and permission;</li> <li>we will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties unless you have authorized us to do so;</li> <li>we will allow you to view, correct or remove your Personal Information and other information associated with your registration as a user of our site; and </li> <li>we will take reasonable steps to protect the security of the Personal Information we collect from you. </li> </ul> <p>The remainder of this policy describes our information handling practices in detail. </p> <p><b>Visiting</b><br>You can always visit our site without revealing who you are or providing any Personal Information. When you visit our site or visit our site through one of our partner's sites, we do collect usage information ("session data"), but it is anonymous and is not linked to you as an individual. We use session data to better understand things like how our site is navigated, how many visitors arrive at specific pages, the length and frequency of stays at our site, the variety of searches of our site's database, the types of browsers and computer operating systems used by our visitors and the Internet Protocol addresses from which our visitors connect to our site. We use this information to improve our site content and ease of use. </p> <p><b>Cookies</b>. <br> We may place a "cookie" on your personal computer. A Cookie is a small computer file that our computer sends to your computer and that your computer sends back to us each time you make a request from our site. Cookies help us recognize you when you visit our site again. We use cookies on our site to collect session data for several purposes to personalize and improve your individual viewing experiences on our site. For example, we use cookies to keep track of your use of our site, gather data to improve the content of our site, provide information that may be of interest to you and improve the security of your experience with us. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. However, you can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit. If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will still be able to access those parts of our site that are available to the general public, but you will not be able to view some information on our site, use some features designed to enhance your experience at our site or access many of the services offered at our site. </p> <p class="brownHead"><b>Registering</b></p> <p><b>Personal Information</b>. <br> If you decide to register with us, we will collect Personal Information about you that you voluntarily share with us. We collect Personal Information that is necessary for us to provide you with the services offered on our site. As mentioned, this Personal Information includes things like your name, e-mail and mailing address and telephone number. You will provide an e-mail address and select a password that will be required to gain access to portions of our site. </p> <p><b>Other Information</b>. <br> You may decide to share other information ("Other Information") with us about yourself (for example, demographic information like your age and gender) and your travel preferences and experiences (for example, seat selection, participation in airline/hotel/car-rental loyalty or awards programs and applicable membership numbers, meal requests and ticketing options). If you share Other Information with us, we will use it to automatically record your travel preferences in reservations you make, tailor your experience at our site to your interests and make more appropriate travel recommendations to you. You may still use our site to search for and purchase travel services even if you choose not to share this type of information with us. </p> <p><b>Opt-out</b>. <br> As part of the registration process, we give you important choices ("opt-in") about advertisements, updates and promotions. We hope you will find these items interesting and informative. Nonetheless, you will let us know if you do not want us to use your e-mail addresses to deliver to you: (1) our bi-weekly deals update highlighting hotel specials, promotions, contests, sweepstakes and other travel opportunities available on our site and/or sponsored by our travel service providers and advertisers.If you do not opt-in to receive these communications about our site, we will not send them to you. </p> <p><b>Purchasing, Booking Or Reserving Travel Services or Accommodations</b></p> <p><b>Payment Information and Travel History</b>. <br> If you register with us, you will be able to book, reserve or purchase travel services or accommodations through our site. To do so, you must provide payment information to us - for example, your credit card specifics like card number, issuing bank, expiration date, cardholder name and billing address. We will add this payment information to your Traveler Profile. We will keep a history of all your reservations, bookings and purchases of travel services and accommodations through our site in your account information, unless you choose to edit your account information as described below in this policy (<i>Changing and Removing Personal Information and Other Information</i>). </p> <p><b>Sharing of Personal Information</b>. <br> Generally, we only disclose your Personal Information to those travel providers that you decide to make arrangements with through our site. For example, when you reserve a hotel room, we will provide the hotel with the Personal Information needed to process your transaction. We use our reasonable efforts to ensure that these travel providers will also protect your Personal Information. We contract with other companies to perform various functions necessary to operate our business - for example, to deliver tickets, ship items and process credit cards. We will share with these other companies only that Personal Information they require to fulfill your orders. These companies agree that they will not use or disclose that Personal Information for any other purpose. Other than as explained in this policy, we will not disclose any Personal Information we collect from you to others without your permission, except in certain limited circumstances: (a) to protect the security of our site; (b) to protect ourselves against liability; (c) in response to legal process, (d) if we believe in good faith that the law requires it; or (e) in connection with a sale of our business or company. Please note that if we receive a formal request to disclose your Personal Information in connection with a legal action, we will attempt to tell you about it at least ten (10) days before we respond to that request, if permitted by law, via the e-mail address you provided during registration. </p> <p><b>Combined Non-Personal Information</b>. <br> We may also combine anonymous information supplied by you and other users during registration on our site with information about your use and others' use of our site. We will use this combined information to describe our user base, without reference to any specific individual, to potential partners, investors and advertisers. We will not share your Personal Information with any other users of our site, but we may use information we collect about your travel preferences and experiences to make recommendations to other users of our site. For example, if we know that you and other users of our site who have traveled to a particular destination had positive experiences at a hotel in that destination, we might recommend that hotel to others who will be traveling to that destination. We may also share aggregated statistical information about users of our site and our service and product offerings with others, including our vendors and partners. We will not link this statistical information to any Personal Information that can identify you as an individual. </p> <p><b>Additional Products and Services</b>. <br> We may partner with other companies to offer you additional products or services. If you sign up for any of these additional products or services, we will share your name and any other Personal Information that is necessary for these other companies to provide the products or services you have signed up for. This policy will not cover the use of your Personal Information by these other companies. We encourage you to read each other company's privacy policy before signing up for any of its products or services. </p> <p><b>Notification of Changes</b>... <br> We may change this policy from time to time. If we decide to change this policy in a material way (for example, a change regarding disclosure of Personal Information), we will post notice of the change on our site and notify you via e-mail at the address you have provided to us or pop-up screen at least thirty (30) days before putting the change into effect. If we decide to change our policy in a less significant way, we will simply post notice of the change on our site at least thirty (30) days before putting the change into effect. If any proposed change is unacceptable to you, you may request to that we remove your personal information (and/or that of other individuals for whom you made your travel reservations) from our records. </p> <p><b>Links</b>... <br> Our site provides links to other sites. When you click on one of these links, you are leaving our site and entering another site that we do not control and for which we cannot be responsible. You should carefully review the privacy statements or policies on any other site that you visit because those privacy statements or policies will apply to your visit to that site and may be very different from our policy. </p> <p class="brownHead"><a name="p12"><b>Contact Information</b></a></p> <p>If you have any questions or concerns about (a) access to Personal Information, (b) the collection, use, management or disclosure of Personal Information, or (c) this policy or our information handling practices, (d) with whom your Personal Information is shared, or if you need further assistance with respect to our Privacy Policy, you may contact our Customer Service department as indicated below. We will attempt to respond to your questions or concerns promptly after we receive them. </p> <p>Email:<a href="mailto:info@lhw.com">info@lhw.com</a><br><br> <b>Mailing Address:</b><br> Leading Hotels of the World, Ltd. <br> 99 Park Ave. <br> New York,<br> NY 10016 USA</p><br><br></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
