<br>
For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act), the data controller is London School of Business &amp; Finance (UK) Limited of 8-9 Holborn, London EC1N 2LL. <br>
<h2> Information we may collect from you </h2>
We may collect and process the following data about you: <br>
<ul class="bullet">
    <li>Information that you provide by filling in forms on our site www.lsbf.org.uk (our site). This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our site, subscribing to our service, posting material or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our site. </li>
    <li>If you contact us, whether by email, telephone, facsimile or post, we may keep a record of that correspondence. </li>
    <li>We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them. </li>
    <li>Details of transactions you carry out through our site and of the fulfilment of your orders. </li>
    <li>Details of your visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2> IP addresses and cookies</h2>
We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and for aggregate marketing reporting purposes. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.<br>
For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us:<br>
<ul class="bullet">
    <li> To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.</li>

    <li> To speed up your searches.</li>
    <li> To recognise you when you return to our site. </li>
</ul>
You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site.<br>
Please note that third-party sites which are linked to on our site may also use cookies, over which we have no control.<br>
<br>
<h2>Where we store your personal data</h2>
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").
