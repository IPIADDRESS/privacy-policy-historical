        <strong>Purpose-based data use and passing on to third parties</strong>
        <p>
            We adhere to the principle of earmarked data use and collect, process and store your personal data only for the purposes for which you have provided us. A transfer of your personal data to third parties will not take place without your express consent, unless this is necessary for the provision of the service or for the performance of the contract. The transfer to government institutions and authorities entitled to receive information only takes place within the scope of the statutory information obligations or if we are obliged to provide information by a court decision.
        </p>
        <p>You can contact our data protection officer at the e-mail address <a href="mailto:hello@lustery.com">hello@lustery.com</a></p>
        
        <strong>Transfers to third countries</strong>
        <p>
            If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if this occurs in the context of the use of third-party services or disclosure or transfer of data to third parties, this only takes place if it occurs for the fulfilment of our (pre)contractual obligations, on the basis of your consent, on the basis of a legal obligation or on the basis of our legitimate interests. We will only process  your data in a third country if this is legally or contractually permitted under the special conditions of Arts. 44 et seq. GDPR. Thus, the processing is carried out, for example, on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognised determination of a data protection level corresponding to the EU (e.g. for the USA through the "Privacy Shield") or compliance with legally recognised standard contractual clauses.
        </p>

        <strong>Integration of third-party services</strong>
        <p>
            Within our online offer, we make no representations or warranties of any kind based on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 par. 1 lit. f. GDPR) content or service offerings from third parties to include content and services such as videos or fonts. The respective third party provider must receive the IP address of the user, as he cannot send the contents to the user's browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the display of this content. We make every effort to use only those contents whose respective providers use the IP address only for the delivery of the contents.
        </p>

        <strong>Data security</strong>
        <p>
            We use the SSL procedure (Secure Socket Layer) within our website in conjunction with the highest enctryption level, which is used by your browser. Usually this is a 256 bit encryption. Whether an individual pages of our web content offer a encrypted transfer can be recognized by the depiction of a closed key or key lock symbol in the status bar of your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect your data against accidental or wilfull manipulation, partial or total loss, distruction or against unauthorised access by third parties. In doing so, we try to continuously improve our security measures and adapt them to technical developments.
