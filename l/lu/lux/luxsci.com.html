to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The following discloses our 
information gathering and dissemination practices for this website, <a href="//luxsci.com">luxsci.com</a>, and our services in general. We reserve 
the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review 
it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify 
you here in this policy, by email, or by means of a notice on our LuxSci

addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party 
dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a>.</p>

 <p>Lux Scientiae complies with the U.S.—Swiss Safe Harbor Framework 
as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, 
use and retention of personal data from Switzerland. Lux Scientiae has 
certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, 
choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and 
enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Lux

</p><h2>EU—U.S. Privacy Shield</h2>

<p>Lux Scientiae participates in and has certified its compliance with the 
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Lux Scientiae is committed to subjecting 
all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, in 
reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework's applicable 
Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the 
U.S. Department of Commerce's <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list">Privacy Shield List</a>. 

</p><p>Lux Scientiae is responsible for the processing of personal data it 
receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers 
to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.  Lux Scientiae complies 
with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal 
data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

</p><p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the 
Privacy Shield Framework, Lux Scientiae is subject to the regulatory 
enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain 
situations, Lux Scientiae may be required to disclose personal data in 
response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet 
national security or law enforcement requirements.

</p><p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield 
website [https://www.privacyshield.gov], you may invoke binding 
arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been 
exhausted.</p>



<h2>General usage</h2>

 <p>While visiting the Lux Scientiae web site, information is stored in log 
files for the purpose of analyzing what pages are accessed, which files are 
downloaded, and what errors occur. This information includes Internet 
protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), 
referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream 
data. We review which top domain addresses visit our site. This process 
does not collect any personal information about you or your business.

 </p><p>When you complete any form on our site including personal information 
such as your name, addresses, email, phone numbers, and other information, 
your information is written to a secure file or database and/or emailed to 
our staff. We will respond to your inquiry if applicable. 

 </p><p>We collect the names, addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers, 
and email addresses of our users in order to identify them and provide 
billing and support services.</p>

<h2>Tracking Technologies</h2>


 <p>We, Lux Scientiae and our marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics 
or online chat service providers, use technologies such as cookies, 
beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the website, 
tracking users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic 
information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based 
on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and 
aggregated basis.</p>

<p>We use cookies for our shopping cart, to remember users' settings (e.g. 
language preference), and for authentication. Users can control the use of 
cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may 
still use our public website, but your ability to use some features or 
areas of our website may be limited.</p>


<h3>HTML5 Local Storage</h3>

<p>We use Local Storage (LS) such as HTML5 to store content information 
and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for 
removing HTML5 LSs.</p>


<h3>Behavioral Targeting</h3>

<p> We partner with a third party ad network to manage our advertising on 
other sites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to 
collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on 
this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon 
your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the 
purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a target="_blank" href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">Here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Here</a>. 
Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will 
continue to receive generic ads.</p>



<h3>Newsletters</h3>

 <p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name 
and email address to send the newsletter to you.  Out of respect for your 
privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. </p>

<h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3>

 <p>We provide you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your personally
identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this 
information.  For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not 
wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can 
indicate your preference on our order form. 

 </p><p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional 
communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the 
instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing 
us at "<span>support</span><b>@</b><span>LuxSci.com</span>". We 
offer an opportunity to opt-out of certain communications on our personal 
profile update pages, or you may contact us at 1-800-441-6612, 
"<span>support</span><b>@</b><span>LuxSci.com</span>", or Lux 
Scientiae, 15 Brook Street, Medfield, MA 02052 USA.</p>

<!--
<h3>OpenID</h3>

 <p>You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as an Open ID 
provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you 
the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name 
and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook 
Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on 
this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your 
network.</p>

 <p>Additionally, we record all logins to Lux Scientiae by our members and 
the pages visited by them. This is for security purposes and for the 
purpose of analyzing what pages and features are being used and with what 
frequency.</p>
-->

<h3>Social Media (Features) and Widgets</h3>

<p> Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as Twitter, 
Facebook, Google+, a RSS Blog Feed, Widgets, a "Share This" button 
and interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may 
collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may 
set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media 
Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly 
on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the 
privacy policy of the company providing it. </p>


<h2>Payments</h2>

 <p>All payments to Lux Scientiae are made securely online via credit card 
or PayPal or offline via check, wire transfer, or direct deposit. After you 
have made a credit card payment, we keep your billing address in our 
secure database to facilitate future payments. We do not keep any record 
of your credit card number unless you authorize us to bill you 
automatically each month. In this case, your credit card information is 
stored in a PCI-compliant way, not on Lux Scientiae's servers.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

 <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you
enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our 
registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure 
socket layer technology (SSL).  [To learn more about SSL, follow this link 
<a href="/blog/how-does-secure-socket-layer-ssl-or-tls-work.html">How Does 
Secure Socket Layer (SSL or TLS) Work?</a>]</p>
 
 <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the 
personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during 
transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the 
Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect 
your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2>Tell-A-Friend</h2>

 <p>If you choose to use our referral service to email a friend about our 
site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.  We will 
automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to 
visit the site.  Lux Scientiae stores this information for the sole 
purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our 
referral program.  </p>

<p>Your friend may contact us at 
<span>support</span><b>@</b><span>LuxSci.com</span> to request that 
we remove this information from our database.</p>


<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

 <p>If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave the Lux 
Scientiae site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because 
we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept 
responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by 
such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the 
same privacy practices as Lux Scientiae. We encourage you to review the 
privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request 
services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to an Lux 
Scientiae site, you should read that site's privacy statement before 
providing any personally identifiable information.

</p><h2>Updating / Accessing / Amending / Correcting Personally Identifiable 
Information</h2>

 <p>Upon request Lux Scientiae will provide you with information about 
whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your 
personal information.  To request this information please login to your 
account and make this request via a <a target="_blank" href-https:="" luxsci.com="" perl="" member="" resources="" tickets.pl="">Support 
Ticket</a>. If you no longer have an account, please use our <a target="_blank" href="/extranet/contact.html">Contact Form</a>.</p>

 <p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no 
longer desire our service and would like to have your personally 
identifiable information deleted,  you may update it by making the change 
on our member profile page or by making a support ticket, or by contacting 
us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. We 
will respond to your request to access within 1 day. You can change your 
personal information online by logging into your "member portal", under 
"Account &gt; My profile". </p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2> 

 <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active 
or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account 
or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services 
contact us at "<span>support</span><b>@</b><span>LuxSci.com</span>".  We will retain and use your information as necessary to 
comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our 
agreements.</p>

<h2>Agents/Service Providers</h2>

 <p>We use other third parties such as a credit card processing company to 
bill you for goods and services, a customer service provider that hosts our
live chat, and data center providers to provide the servers on which our
live services reside. When you sign up for services such as Premium Email 
Filtering, Email Archival, SSL Certificates, DNS Service, Domain 
and Registration, we may share your name, physical address, and email 
address as necessary for the third party to provide that service. </p>

 <p>These third parties are prohibited from using your personally 
identifiable information for promotional purposes. </p>

<h2>Import Contacts</h2>

 <p>We provide an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with 
your contacts by importing your existing contact list into your address 
books while you are logged into your portal account. </p>

 <p>When logged into the portal, third party personal information may be 
entered such as name, email, address, and other personal information. This 
information is only used for the purpose it is collected for. </p>


<h2>Non-disclosure</h2>

 <p>Lux Scientiae will not release any information about its clients to 
third parties without the clients' explicit consent, except as required for 
compliance with local, state, and federal law or as further set forth 
below. </p>

<p>In certain situations, Lux Scientiae may be required to disclose 
personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, 
including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

 <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required 
by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our 
rights and/or comply with a judicial or bankruptcy proceeding, court order, 
or legal process served on our Web site. If Lux Scientiae is involved in a 
merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets,  you will 
be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any 
change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any 
choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>


 <p>If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this Web site, you 
should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit 
there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and 
could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible 
for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums. 
Testimonials are also posted on our site and users have given permission 
to have their personal information submitted in these testimonials. With 
your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. To request 
removal of your personal information from these public areas of our site, 
contact us at 
<span>privacy-officer</span><b>@</b><span>LuxSci.com</span>. In 
some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in 
which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. 
Alternatively, if you used a third party application to post such 
information, you may be able to remove it by either logging into the said 
application and removing the information or by contacting the appropriate 
third party application.

 </p><p>Some of our blogs (e.g. LuxSci Status) are managed by a third party 
application that may require you to register to post a comment. We do not 
have access or control of the information posted to the blog. You will 
need to contact or login into the third party application if you want your 
personal information that was posted to the comments section removed. To 
learn how the third party application uses your information, please review 
their privacy statement.</p>

<p>For Customers using Legacy Basic Dedicated Physical Servers and Legacy Shared Business Class 
Hosting:

	</p><blockquote>

	<p>The Lux Scientiae Acceptable Use Policies specifically prohibit the 
use of our service for illegal activities. Therefore, you agree that Lux 
Scientiae may disclose any and all of your information including assigned 
IP numbers, account history, account use, etc. to any law enforcement 
agent who makes a verified written request, without further consent or 
notification to you. LuxSci, or its Basic Server Provider Partners, will 
verify the legitimacy and authenticity of any such request and determine 
if compliance with the request is required by local, state, or federal law 
or if, in its sole discretion, the request should be filled even if it is 
not required by local, state, or federal law. In addition, Lux Scientiae 
shall have the right to suspend or terminate all services, at its sole 
discretion, during such a legal investigation.</p>
	</blockquote>

<p>For all other Customers:</p>

	<blockquote>
	<p>You agree that Lux Scientiae may disclose any and all of your 
information including assigned IP numbers, account history, account use, 
etc. to any law enforcement agent who makes a verified written request, 
without further consent or notification to you. LuxSci will verify the 
legitimacy and authenticity of any such request and determine if 
compliance with the request is required by local, state, or federal law. 
Only if the request is verified and compliance is required will the 
request be filled. In addition, Lux Scientiae shall have the right to 
suspend or terminate all services, at its sole discretion, during such a 
legal investigation.</p>
	</blockquote>

 <p> Lux Scientiae does not give out its client's email addresses or send
SPAM. Lux Scientiae may occasionally send important announcements 
regarding Lux Scientiae services to its clients if they have not opted out 
of this notification service.</p>

 <p>For Customers that have a valid <a href="/extranet/hipaa-baa-standard.html">HIPAA Business Associate 
Agreement</a> (BAA) with Lux Scientiae, in the event of a conflict or 
inconsistency between the terms of this nondisclosure policy and those of 
the BAA, the terms of the BAA shall prevail.</p>

<h2>Confidentiality</h2> 

 <p>Lux Scientiae staff will not examine the following classes of data 
without Customer's explicit consent:</p>

<ol>

	<li> Email: The content of sent and received email messages, with the
exception of the message metadata including: sender address, recipient 
addresses, message subject, message size, message id, IP address of the 
sending or connecting computers, and any message header information 
removed from messages for the purposes of outbound message anonymization.

	</li><li> WebAides: The content of all WebAides, including comments and
attachments

	</li><li> Widgets: The content of all Widgets, except the content of custom
or third party widgets that is defined directly as part of the widget 
definition.

	</li><li> Databases: The content of all databases hosted by Customer in its
web hosting account.

	</li><li> Files: The content of all files saved to the Customers web/FTP
space, except as they may otherwise be publicly accessible on the 
Internet via Customer's web site. Note that this covers only the content 
of the files, not the list of what files are present and what directories 
they are located in.

</li></ol>

<p>Information that does not fall within the above classes of data (i.e. 
email message metadata) will still be kept in the strictest confidence in 
accordance with Lux Scientiae's non-disclosure policy.</p>

 <p>Exception 1: in a case where Lux Scientiae becomes aware of evidence of 
a possible violation by a client of its <a href="/extranet/aup.html">Acceptable Use Policy</a> and it concludes that
analysis of data is necessary in order to determine the facts, in order to 
prevent the sending of SPAM, Unsolicited Email, excessive utilization of 
system resources, or other violations of LuxSci's AUPs, Lux Scientiae will 
examine such client's data solely for such purpose. The contents of 
client's data will be kept in the strictest confidence in accordance with 
Lux Scientiae's non-disclosure policy. </p>
