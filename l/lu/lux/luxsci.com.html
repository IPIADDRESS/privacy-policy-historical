<h1>Lux Scientiae Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Lux Scientiae, Incorporated has created this privacy statement in order 
to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The following discloses our 
information gathering and dissemination practices for this website and our 
services in general.  Any updates or amendments to this policy will be 
made here and announced in the news section of LuxSci's members' 
portal.</p>


<h2>General usage:</h2> 

<p>While visiting the Lux Scientiae web site, information is stored in a 
log file for the purpose of analyzing what pages are accessed, which files 
are downloaded, and what errors occur. We review which top domain 
addresses visit our site. This process does not collect any personal 
information about you or your business.</p> 

<p>When you complete any form on our site, your information is written to 
a secure file or database and/or emailed to our staff.</p>


<h2>Members:</h2> 

<p>We collect the name, address, phone number, and email addresses of our 
users in order to identify them and provide billing and support services.  
Once a user has logged in to Lux Scientiae, cookies are used for
authentication and verification purposes. Our cookies reside in a small
file stored on your computer, which expires when you close your web 
browser (or sooner, depending you your personal preferences). Our cookies 
do not track your movement throughout the Internet and do not, ever, send 
us information about you when you are not on our site. </p> 

 <p>Additionally, we record all logins to Lux Scientiae by our members and 
the pages visited by them.  This is for security purposes and for the 
purpose of analyzing what pages and features are being used and with what 
frequency.</p>


<h2>Payments:</h2> 

<p>All payments to Lux Scientiae are made securely online via credit card 
or PayPal or offline via check. After you have made a credit card payment, 
we keep your billing address in our secure database to facilitate future 
payments.  We do not keep any record of your credit card number on our 
servers unless you authorize us to bill you automatically each month. In 
this case, your credit card information is encrypted and stored in our 
secure database (so even if the database were to be stolen, the credit 
card information would still be secure). 


</p><h2>Non-disclosure:</h2> 

<p>Lux Scientiae will not release any information about its clients to 
third parties without the clients' explicit consent, except as required 
for compliance with local, state, and federal law.  Lux Scientiae does not 
give out its client's email addresses or send SPAM.  Lux Scientiae may 
occasionally send important announcements regarding Lux Scientiae services 
to its clients if they have not opted out of this notification service.</p>


<h2>Confidentiality:</h2> 

<p>Lux Scientiae staff will not examine the content of your incoming or
outgoing email messages or your Web Aides without your explicit consent.  
The exception to this rule is the case where Lux  Scientiae management 
deems a client to be in possible violation of its <a href="/extranet/aup.html">Acceptable Use Policy</a> and deems that analysis 
of email messages or Web Aides is necessary in order to establish this fact 
or to stop the sending of SPAM,  Unsolicited Email, excessive utilization
of system resources, or other violations of LuxSci's AUP.  In any case, the 
contents of your email messages and Web Aides will be kept in the strictest 
confidentiality that can be afforded by compliance with local, state, and 
federal law.</p>
