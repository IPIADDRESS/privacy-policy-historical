<p>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also disclose your Personal Information to outside individuals and/or companies who help us: bring you the products and services we offer; create, operate, and maintain the Web site(s); and with specialized services such as payment processing, shipping, mail and email distribution, mobile messaging, Web site(s) hosting, monitoring, analytics, sweepstakes and promotions management, survey and mobile payment processing. We provide these companies only with the information they need to perform their services. We also work with third parties, such as ad networks, analytics companies and social networking platforms, and they may collect information about your online activities over time and across our sites and other online services. We require that these outside individuals and/or companies agree to keep all information shared with them confidential and to use the information only to perform their obligations to us. We may also contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to Personal Information.</p>
<p>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, your information may be disclosed to third parties who help design, administer and implement the promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment and aggregated data analysis.

<p>4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may disclose your Personal Information when legally required to do so, to cooperate with law enforcement investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Web site(s), to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of the Web site(s) or the public.</p>
<p>4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may provide products or services jointly with certain third-party businesses, for example and without limitation, retail businesses. We may share your Personal Information with such entities to help them deliver to you purchased goods and services, and to provide you with better service and to measure our program’s value. Sharing this information will allow such affiliate providers to market products and services directly to you, should they so choose. We will only share your Personal Information with affiliate providers with whom you engage in activities on the Web site(s).</p>
<p>4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, if we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company or a financing, investment, support or funding, sharing or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the assets shared or transferred. If we engage in any of these types of transactions, your information will be subject to our Privacy Policy in effect at the time of the transfer or sharing of such information.</p>
<p>4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Web site(s) may allow users to post comments and other content to the Web site(s). Any Personal Information that you post to the Web site(s) will become public information and will be accessible by other users of the Web site(s). In addition, your user name will be viewable by other users, and we therefore encourage you to use a user name that is not your actual name. We have no responsibility to maintain the privacy or security of any such Personal Information that you may choose to post to the Web site(s).</p>
<p>4.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mobile phone numbers may be used to send SMS (Short Message Service), text and voice message notifications related to the Web site(s) and to communicate offers.

</ol>
<p>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through your use of the Web site(s), we may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information from you (“NPII”). NPII is not associated with you as an individual. It is measured anonymously and only in the aggregate. We use NPII to maintain and administer the Web site(s), analyze trends, gather demographic information and comply with applicable law. We may share this information with others without express notice to you or consent from you, and we may exploit, use and disclose your NPII without limitation of any kind.</p>
<p>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Web site(s) may use cookies. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a Web site(s) that is saved on your hard drive by your computer’s browser. Cookies help us remember you when you return to the Web site(s). Cookies also hold information to personalize and enhance your experience and to gather Web site(s) statistical data, such as which pages are visited, the Internet provider’s domain name and the addresses of the sites you visited immediately before coming to and immediately after leaving the Web site(s). The information in the cookies lets us trace your “clickstream” activity (i.e., the paths taken by users of the Web site(s) as they move from page to page) to enable us to better serve you by revealing which portions of the Web site(s) are the most popular. Cookies contain absolutely no Personal Information. We may also allow our affiliate and service providers and advertisers to serve cookies from the Web site(s) to allow them to assist us in various activities such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of the Web site(s), its content and advertising. Some third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offer a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (http://www.networkadvertising.org). In addition, some cookies may be placed by third- party service providers who perform some of these functions (or other services) for us. Cookies are used on this web site for the following third party services: Facebook Like and Share Button, Twitter Follow and Retweet button, Google +1 button, and if videos are embedded from sites such as YouTube or Vimeo, etc., they may set their own cookies that are beyond our control. Some of these services may be used to track your behavior on other websites and we have no control over this.</p>
<p>The Web site will comply with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_track_header">Do Not Track</a>&nbsp;browser settings, where supported, for certain cookies.

<p>5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also use “pixel tags” (sometimes called “Web beacons” or “clear gifs”), which are tiny graphic images, on the Web site(s). Pixel tags help us analyze users’ online behavior and measure the effectiveness of the Web site(s) and our advertising and marketing. We may also use other analytical tools to evaluate site performance through the use of aggregated data, which contain no Personal Information. We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information.</p>
<p>5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies, pixel tags, and/or other analytical tools that we may use on the Web site(s) may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Web site(s). This information may include your computer’s Internet protocol (IP) address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer. We may also track certain information about the identity of the Web site(s) you visited immediately before coming to the Web site(s). We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other Web site(s). Cookies, pixel tags, and/or other analytical tools in our emails may also be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from us. We may also work with businesses that use tracking technologies to deliver advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to the Web site(s) and your interaction with our advertising and other communications, but no Personal Information is shared with them.</p>
<p>5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may combine the NPII collected through cookies, pixel tags and other analytical tools with other information we may have collected from you. This information may be used to improve the Web site(s), to personalize your online experience, to help us deliver information to you, to determine the effectiveness of advertising, and for other internal business purposes. We may use and share aggregated and anonymous information to conduct market research and analysis for ourselves and/or for our business partners. Given the anonymous, non-personally identifiable nature of such information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy on how we may use or disclose such information. For example, we may freely share such information with third parties who may use such data for their own marketing, advertising, research, or other business purposes. We may also freely share such information with our service providers in order for them to perform services to or for us.</p>
<p>5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ads appearing on the Web site(s) may be delivered to users by Us or one of our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by us and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<p>5.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We authorize certain service providers to use NPII for their business purposes and in accordance with their privacy policies, such as to report on usage or industry trends to their customer base.</p>

To the extent permitted by JAMS procedures, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses and an equal share of the arbitrators’ and administrative fees of arbitration, with Napean LLC remaining responsible for its share of costs, expenses and fees plus any costs, expenses and fees required of it under JAMS procedures.</p>
<p>(f) Litigation. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. Either party also may, without waiving any remedy under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that party, pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal (or pending the arbitral tribunal’s determination of the merits of the controversy). We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>(g) Other. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>(h) Subject to the requirement for arbitration hereunder, in any action arising out of or relating to this Privacy Policy, the laws of the State of New York shall be applied, without regard to choice of laws.</p>
<p>(i) Class Action Waiver. The parties further expressly waive any ability to maintain any class action in any forum. Any arbitration, claim or other proceedings by or between you and Napean shall be conducted on an individual basis and not in any class action, mass action, or on a consolidated or representative basis. You further agree that the arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide relief or to combine or aggregate similar claims or unrelated transactions. You acknowledge and agree that this agreement specifically prohibits you from commencing arbitration proceedings as a representative of others. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.</p>
