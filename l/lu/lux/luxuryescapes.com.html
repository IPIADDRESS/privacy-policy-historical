<p>2.5 The Website uses social plugins (hereinafter "Plugins") of the social network Facebook, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S.

Find an overview of the Facebook plugins and their appearance on http://developers.facebook.com/plugins. If you request a page of our website which contains a plugin, your browser will build up a direct connection to the servers of Facebook.

This information (including your IP address) will be sent directly from your browser to a Facebook server in the U.S. and stored there.  If you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can assign your visit to our website directly to your Facebook account.  If you interact with the plugins, for example, by pressing the "Like" button or by leaving a comment, the corresponding information is also transmitted directly to a Facebook server and is stored there.  The information is also posted on Facebook and can be seen by your Facebook friends.  Facebook may use this information for purposes of advertising, market research and personalised design of Facebook pages.  For this purpose, Facebook creates profiles regarding usage, interests and relationships, e.g. to evaluate your use of our website with regard to the advertisements displayed to you on Facebook, to inform other Facebook users about your activities on our website and to provide further related services with the use of Facebook.  If you do not want Facebook to allocate the collected data via our website to your Facebook account, you must log out of Facebook before you visit our website.  To find out more about the purpose and extent to which Facebook collects, processes and uses these data, your rights and the settings available to protect your privacy, please read the Facebook privacy policy.
