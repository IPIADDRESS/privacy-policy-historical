					<h3>ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
                    <p>At Luxology we take privacy very seriously. We hate SPAM, 
					unless it's fried SPAM®, with a little parmesan on the 
					side and then we just dislike it. Here are some things we 
					will and will not do on our site and with your information.</p>
					<div class="content">
						<h4>Luxology WILL:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Gather information about visitors IP and email addresses 
							  as well as domain names when possible so that we may reduce 
							  the abuse from pirates, and other "no-goodnicks". 
							  This is for our protection and yours.</li>
							<li>Use gathered information to determine ways to customize 
							  and improve our site to fit the needs of our users.</li>
							<li>Use cookies to store information about users so that we 
							  can remember information to make visiting our site a more 
							  personalized and enjoyable experience.</li>
							<li>Use your registered email address to contact you regarding 
							  administrative issues with your account only if the information 
							  is specific to you and cannot be presented in any other 
							  manner. </li>
							<li>Send important information and announcements about Luxology 
							  to your registered email address only if you have chosen 
							  to opt into the mailing list through your account preferences. 
							  If at any time you have problems with your preferences and 
							  wish to be removed from this service please send email to 
							  webmaster@luxology.net</li>
						</ul>
							<h4> Luxology WILL NOT:</h4>
							<ul>
							<li>Share your information with any other company or entity.</li>
							<li>Sell your information to any other company or entity.</li>
							<li>Knowingly contribute to the proliferation of SPAM. AS 
							  we stated earlier, we feel SPAM is a crime against intelligent 
							  people.</li>
							<li>Harm any animals (particularly cows) in the creation 
							  of our web site.</li>
							<li>From time to time our security policy may change. In 
							  that event, users will be contacted and given an opportunity 
							  to evaluate our newest policy and make an informed decision 
							  regarding their continued participation.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>At Luxology we are just a bunch of computer geeks. We love 
					playing with computers and we love all the advantages in
						communication  that the internet provides. We want to
						leverage these abilities to better communicate with you.
						There are companies that will take advantage of these
						abilities. We are not one of those companies. We just
						want to hang out and talk about 3D with all of you. If
						you are ever dissatisfied with our service or security
						policies and implementation, please <a href="/company/contact.aspx">contact
						us</a>.
						We are serious about these issues. </p>
