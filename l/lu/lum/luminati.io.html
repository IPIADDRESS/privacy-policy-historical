Luminati Limited ("Luminati ", "we," or "us") is the owner of the website
luminati.io ("the Site"), the Luminati software ("the Software"), the Luminati
SDK (“the SDK”) and any accompanying services, features, content, and
applications offered by us (collectively referred herein as "the Services"). We
are concerned about your privacy and have designed this Privacy Policy in order
to help you decide whether to use the Services. This Privacy Policy is a
legally binding agreement between you ("you" or "user") and us. By accessing
and using the Services, or providing information to us in other formats, you
agree and accept the terms of this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time
and consent to the collection and use of information in the manner set out in
this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy carefully
and to periodically refer to it so that you understand it and any subsequent
changes made to it. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY,
PLEASE STOP USING THE SERVICES IMMEDIATELY AND UNINSTALL WHERE RELEVANT.<br>
<br>
IN ADDITION TO THIS POLICY, PLEASE REVIEW OUR

We collect the following types of data from you when you use the Services:
<ul>
  <li>
    Anonymous Information: We collect Anonymous Information about your use of
    the Services for three reasons: first, to allow us to provide the Services
    and constantly improve them; second, for security reasons; and third, so
    that we can audit and track usage statistically, audit our affiliates, and
    calculate payments to 3rd parties. Such Anonymous Information includes your
    approximate geo-location, hardware specifications, OS version, browser type
    and version, the date of the Software installation, your
    URL requests, and respective time stamps. Anonymous data may also include any
    other data that is not sensitive and does not identify or may identify you.
  </li>
  <li>
    Personal Information: Personal Information is information that may be of a
    private or
    sensitive nature, and which identifies or may identify you. The Personal
    Information we collect and retain may include your IP address, Hostname,
    your name, email address in the case that you provide us with this
    information (for instance when you open an account or if you approach us
    through the "contact us" option), screen name, payment and billing
    information (if you purchase premium services) or other information we may
    ask from time to time as will be required for the Services provisioning.
    When you create an account on the Services you are able to do so by using
    your credentials with a designated third party website or service ("Third
    Party Account") such as FacebookÂ®. Doing so will enable you to link your
    account and your Third Party Account. If you choose this option, a Third
    Party Account pop-up box will appear that you will need to approve in order
    to proceed, and which will describe the types of information that we will
    obtain. This information includes your Personal Information stored on your
    Third Party Account, such as user-name, email address, profile picture,
    birthday, gender and preferences. Any Anonymous Information that is
    specifically connected or linked to any Personal Information, is treated by
