	<a name="overview">PRIVACY OVERVIEW</a></h2>
<p>
	We respect the privacy of all visitors to our websites. This Privacy Policy describes the ways in which the Lupus Foundation of America (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collect, use, and disclose information about you through our websites and online services that link to this Privacy Policy, which include lupus.org, <a href="http://www.resources.lupus.org" target="_blank">resources.lupus.org</a> and all other related sub-domains, the embedded websites of our national network affiliates, lupusnow.org, shoplupus.org, lupusvoices.org, walktoendlupus.org, worldlupusday.org, LFA-POINT.org, and cruelmystery.org (collectively, the “Site”).&nbsp; By using the Site, you consent to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, now and as amended by us.</p>
<h2>
	<br>
	<a name="why">WHY WE COLLECT INFORMATION</a></h2>
<p>
	We use data gathered through our Site for a number of purposes, including, but not limited to: distributing information, conducting programs, providing services, processing orders and donations, responding to questions, fulfilling requests, monitoring and improving the effectiveness of our websites, planning for future improvements and as we otherwise agree.&nbsp; We do not automatically collect email addresses or other personal information unless you provide it to us.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
	<br>
	<a name="collect">INFORMATION WE COLLECT, AND HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION</a></h2>
<h3>
	<em>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE</em></h3>
<p>
	We and our service providers collect any information that you provide when you use the Site, including when you create an account, make a donation, purchase a product, participate in our message boards or forums or research, register for an event or class, sign up to receive our electronic newsletters or subscribe to our magazine, sign up for advocacy alerts or email lists, participate in polls and surveys, or otherwise contact us with a question, comment, or request.</p>
<p>
	The information that you provide us can include, but is not limited to, (a) your name, contact information, username, password, email address and other registration information; (b) transaction-related information or payment card information, such as when you make donations or purchases; (c) information you provide when participating in research, an interest group, or a message board; and (d) information you provide us when you contact us.</p>
<h3>
	<br>
	<em>INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED FROM YOU</em></h3>
<p>
	We and our service providers may automatically collect certain technical information from your computer or mobile device when you use the Site, such as your Internet Protocol address or unique identifier, your browser type, your operating system, the pages you view on the Site, the pages you view immediately before and after you access the Site, and the search terms you enter on the Site.&nbsp; This information allows us to recognize you and personalize your experience if you return to the Site, and to improve the Site and the services we provide.&nbsp; We and our service providers may collect this information using “cookies,” which are small text files that the Site saves on your computer using your web browser and accesses when you return, or similar technologies.</p>
<h3>
	Cookies</h3>
<p>
	A “cookie” is a small file placed on your computer to allow a website to recognize your computer on return visits. Like most websites, we use cookies to manage certain website features and to provide localized information. These cookies do not contain information typically used to identify you but they may contain demographic (such as language preference) or interest-based information.&nbsp; Other technologies are used for similar purposes as a cookie on other platforms where cookies are not available or applicable, such as the Advertising ID available on Android mobile devices. Most web browsers give you options for preventing, accepting, or receiving notice of new cookies.&nbsp; If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, however, some Site features may be lost or not function properly.</p>
<p>
	Many consider the use of cookies for these purposes to be an industry standard. Consequently, your web browser is likely set to accept cookies or allow other identifiers. There are several options for opting out of cookies and other tracking technologies, which include but are not limited to setting your web browser to private or incognito mode, opting out of the collection of data on your web and application activity through your mobile device or desktop computer. Please note that if you delete, reject, or otherwise prohibit cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	Information Collected by Third Parties</h3>
<p>
	We use third party tools and services such as Google Analytics and AdWords that may deploy cookies, pixel tags, or similar tracking technologies to collect, analyze and report on Site activity and evaluate marketing campaign performance. A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on websites, and all of the information resources provided through them.</p>
<h3>
	Statistical Data</h3>
<p>
	We collect information such as the total number of visitors, the date, time, length and frequency of visits, the average length of time and total number of times that visitors view each page, the device and software used to access our websites, how visitors arrived at our Site, and the domain name and locations of visitors' internet service providers.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also compile lists of the keywords and search terms that visitors used to find information published on our Site, and the websites or search engines that referred visitors to our websites.</p>
<h3>
	Geolocation Data</h3>
<p>
	When you access and use the Site, we may receive, store and process different types of information about your geographic location, including general information (e.g., zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Sites). If you access the Site through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided that your device allows you to do so. Please see your device manufacturer’s instructions for further details.</p>

<p>
	<u>Contact Information</u><br>
	When you submit an inquiry to the Health Educator we ask for certain contact information including, but not limited to, your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number and mailing address in order to respond to your inquiry.</p>
<p>
	<u>Health Information and Demographic Information</u><br>
	Your submission to the Health Educator may include health information, such as diagnosis information.&nbsp; In addition, when responding to your inquiry we may ask for additional health information to better respond to your request. We also ask for demographic information in order to better improve our services. You are not obligated to provide any health or demographic information you do not want to provide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<u>Inquiry Information</u><br>
	The inquiry information we collect may include any information you elect to provide in the form of a question to the Health Educator. This information also includes the subject of the inquiry, the date of the inquiry, and information regarding individuals on whose behalf you may be seeking information.</p>
<h3>
	How We Use and Disclose Information Provided When You Contact the Health Educator Online</h3>
<p>
	Submitting an inquiry online does NOT enroll you to receive other communications from us unless you specifically indicate you would like to do so.&nbsp; Only members of our Data Management Team and other personnel with a need to know have access to the identifiable information described above.&nbsp; We may use this information to allow us to improve the Site and the services we provide, as well as to better understand the needs of our constituents.&nbsp; We may do so by aggregating this information and creating reports that do not contain any individually identifying information or contact information.&nbsp; We may use your location information to help us better serve you and identify resources that may be specific to your geographic location.&nbsp; We do not share or sell any of the information described above with any non-affiliated third party. We may, however, us this information to provide you with information from non-affiliated third parties.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	<br>
	<em>TAKING PART IN THE ONLINE RESEARCH.FORME LUPUS REGISTRY&nbsp;</em></h3>
<p>
	The Lupus Research Registry (the “Registry”) is a formal research registration program with its own safeguards for the information you provide. You can find detailed information at lupus.org/registry.&nbsp; A summary of that information is provided in this section as well. The Registry is open only to individuals with a lupus diagnosis.</p>
<h3>
	Information You Provide</h3>
<p>
	<u>Contact Information</u><br>
	The Registry asks for your contact information including your e-mail, mailing address and phone number in order to contact you about studies that may be of interest to you or to the individual you are registering.</p>
<p>
	<u>Health, Research, and Demographic Information</u><br>
	The Registry contains several questions about your health and quality of life. This information is considered health information. We also ask questions about your date of birth and other demographics. The information allows us to better focus our programs and services to your needs as well as to identify study opportunities for which you may be a match.</p>
<p>
	<u>Informed Consent</u><br>
	To enroll in the Registry, you will be asked to complete an Informed Consent form, which includes your electronic signature.&nbsp; This form will provide information on the Registry, and any risks of participation.&nbsp; Additional Informed Consent forms may be required to participate in specific research studies.</p>
<h3>
	How We Use and Disclose Information Provided to the Registry</h3>
<p>
	Information submitted through the Registry is subject to the requirements set forth by a third party Institutional Review Board and any informed consents to which you agree. Details about those processes will be made available to registry participants. In addition, except as required by an Institutional Review Board, and any informed consents:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Signing up for the Registry does NOT sign you up to receive other types of communications from the Lupus Foundation of America.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		No individual contact or personal health information is ever shared with third parties without your explicit consent.</li>
	<li>
		We may use and disclose your information in aggregate (summary) form about groups of participants, which does not include your identifiable information.</li>
	<li>
		We may use or disclose your information using a code where your contact information, date of birth and other information that could identify you is removed.</li>
	<li>
		We may disclose your contact information to another organization conducting a study or survey that collects information similar to what you have previously provided to the Registry. In those cases, they may ask for your permission to receive specific data points from the Registry. If you agree to this, we will disclose only those data points. If you do not give your permission, we will not disclose that information.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	How to Unsubscribe from the Registry</h3>
<p>
	You may unsubscribe from the Registry at any time by sending an e-mail to registrycoordinator@lupus.org. When you unsubscribe from the Registry you will no longer be contacted by the Registry about study opportunities.</p>
<h3>
	<br>
	<em>TAKING PART IN THE ONLINE RESEARCH.FORME LUPUS INTEREST GROUP</em></h3>
<p>
	Unlike the Registry, the Lupus Interest Group is not a formal research study. The Lupus Research Interest Group (the “Interest Group”) is ian online forum where you can sign up to receive information about opportunities for participating in research that may be interesting to you. To read more about the difference between participating in the two options please go to lupus.org/research/enroll-in-a-lupus-research-interest-group.</p>
<h3>
	Information You Provide</h3>
<p>
	<u>Contact Information</u><br>
	The Lupus Interest Group registration process asks for your contact information including your e-mail, mailing address and phone number in order to contact you about studies that may be of interest to you or to the individual you are enrolling. Registering for the Interest Group does NOT sign you up to receive other types of communications from us.</p>
<p>
	<u>Demographic and Health Information</u><br>
	The Interest Group enrollment will ask for fewer details about your health and quality of life than the Registry enrollment. Instead, you will answer a few general questions about your diagnosis process and demographics.&nbsp; This information is collected in order to better communicate to you about our programs, services and informal studies that meet your specific needs.</p>
<h3>
	How We Use and Disclose Information Provided to the Interest Group</h3>
<p>
	Only members of our Data Management Team and other personnel with a need to know have access to the identifiable information described above.&nbsp; Your information may be disclosed in aggregate (summary) form in a way that does not contain identifiable information.</p>
<h3>
	How to Unsubscribe from the Lupus Interest Group</h3>
<p>
	You may unsubscribe from the Interest Group at any time by sending an e-mail to registrycoordinator@lupus.org.</p>
<h3>
	<br>
	<em>WHEN YOU PARTICIPATE IN OUR MESSAGE BOARDS</em></h3>
<h3>
	Information You Provide</h3>
<p>
	To participate in the message boards, you must register for the service, which includes creating a username and password and providing an email address.&nbsp; You also can login using your Facebook credentials.&nbsp; We will not publicly reveal your email address or post your information to Facebook without your explicit permission.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	How We Use and Disclose Information Provided to the Interest Group</h3>
<p>
	The message boards are available for public use to all individuals who agree to and abide by our Terms and Conditions.&nbsp; Any information shared in the message boards may be shared with others who see it, as well as by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
