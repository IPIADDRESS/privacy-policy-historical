<div class="shadedBox" style="padding: 10px 20px 10px;">

    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p>We will always respect your privacy. Any
information that you give us is held with the utmost care and will not be used
other than as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Lunchwalla has created this Privacy
Policy to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy on LUNCHWALLA.com (
"Lunchwalla"). </p>

<p>We have adopted a set of information management
guidelines that serve as the basis for our customer relationships. These
guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet and mobile
technologies are rapidly evolving. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to
change. Any such changes will be posted on this page. Please read this Privacy
Policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you use
Lunchwalla.com. Please see our Terms of Use for more information about our
online policies in general.</p>

<p>If
you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, the practices of Lunchwalla.com,
or your dealings on our web site, please <a style="color: Blue; text-decoration: underline;" href="/contact">contact us via Email</a></p>

<p><b><i>The Information We Collect</i></b></p>

<p>We<b> </b>collect the personally identifiable
information that you submit on the registration and user profile forms to
permit you access to our site where applicable. Please note that any optional
information you fill out might be visible to other users on the site. If you do
not feel comfortable with others knowing this information, then leave it blank.<br>

<br>
Generally, the information Lunchwalla.com collects helps us to communicate with
you. For instance, we use your email address to provide you with an email
confirmation of your registration and to notify you of information concerning
your&nbsp;account on our site. In addition, users on the site will be able to
communicate with you via&nbsp;comments on the site, but they will not know your
e-mail address or other personal identification information aside from your
profile details (and therefore will not be able to add you to spam lists, etc).
<br>
<br>
We will not share, rent or sell your personally-identifiable information with
any entity, subject to the provisions below. We may share your information with
our vendors in connection with system maintenance and other services that these
individuals or entities perform for us. In some cases, we may run a joint
marketing effort with third parties.</p>

<p><b><i>User Registration</i></b>.  Registration on the Lunchwalla is strictly voluntary. To
register for Lunchwalla, you must provide your e-mail address, name, gender
and year of birth. This information is required in the registration process but
we recognize that this is your personal information and, except as we explain
below, we do not give it out to third parties without your approval.   In order
to vote or plan a lunch or event, we require that you provide a valid mailing
address.</p>

<p><b><i>Discussion Boards</i></b>.   In order to participate on our discussion boards, you
will need to register on  Lunchwalla.com. If you use our discussion boards, you
should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there
can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be
used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally
identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>

<p><b><i>Cookies.</i></b> The Lunchwalla.com site employs cookies (small pieces of
text stored on your computer) to recognize you and your access privileges. For
example, we use cookies to allow you to log on to Lunchwalla automatically
without entering your ID and password each visit. Cookies also identify you and
your preferences on our site. For these purposes, these cookies are tied to
your personally identifiable information. You may refuse to accept our cookies,
but we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user or subscriber,
which will limit your access to the site.</p>

<p><b><i>Location Selector.</i></b> If you choose to enter a
street address when selecting a location, this information will be saved for
your convenience in your Locations list or in your Saved Locations list
should you so indicate. This information may make it easier for you to browse
and search our content and will not be used for any other purpose.</p>

<p><b><i>Tell a Friend.</i></b> If you choose to email a
list, review or link to a friend from the Lunchwalla site, we collect the
friend's name and e-mail address. This information is
used only to deliver a one-time message to your friend and is not stored on our
servers. If "a friend" decides that he/she will register with
Lunchwalla, he or she will be given the same rights of access as registered
users of  Lunchwalla.com. The prospect information that you submit for "a
friend" will be used only for the use for which it is submitted.
Additionally, for "a friend" to register, he or she will have to
follow the Lunchwalla.com registration process (see above) and will be given
the same option in regard to receiving marketing materials that Lunchwalla.com offers
to all registered users.</p>

<p><b><i>IP Addresses  </i></b>LUNCHWALLA.com logs IP addresses, or the location of your
computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting
purposes.</p>

<h4>Facebook Connect</h4>

<p>Lunchwalla allow users to access Facebook
Connect to interact with friends and to share on Facebook through Wall and
friends' News Feeds. If you are already logged into Lunchwalla and Facebook,
when you click on "Connect with Facebook" you will be prompted to

into Facebook, when you click on "Connect with Facebook" you will be
prompted to enter your Facebook credentials or to "Sign up for
Facebook." By proceeding, you are allowing Lunchwalla to access your
information and you are agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use in your use of
Lunchwalla.</p>

<p>Conversely, if you are not currently
registered as a Lunchwalla user and you click on "Sign in Using
Facebook," you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and
then be given the option to register and join Lunchwalla. Once you register on
Lunchwalla and Connect with Facebook, you will be able to automatically post
recent activity back to Facebook. You have the option to disable Facebook
Connect at any time by logging into "My Profile" and clicking on
"My Facebook Profile." Further, you can edit privacy settings for the

policy in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to opt out or
otherwise prevent that us. You may determine when this Privacy Policy was
updated last by noting the "Last Updated" date directly beneath the
