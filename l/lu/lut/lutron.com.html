						<p>Lutron Electronics, Inc. respects the privacy of our website visitors. Please review the
						following document that explains how we continue to maintain the highest
						level of integrity while continuing to offer world-class products and
						services to our customers.</p>
						
						<p>Lutron’s Commitment to Privacy</p>
						
						<p>This policy is designed to aid you in recognizing how we collect, use and safeguard any personal
						information that you voluntarily provide to us. This statement will be
						continuously assessed against new technologies and business practices as
						well as our customers' needs.</p>
						
						<p>What Information Does Lutron Collect?</p>
						
						<p>When you visit www.lutron.com you may provide us with two types of information: web site use
						information collected on an aggregate basis as you and other people
						browse our web site, and personal information you knowingly and
						voluntarily choose to disclose to Lutron that we collect on an
						individual basis.</p>
						
						<p>How Does Lutron Collect Web Site Use Information?</p>
						
						<p>Similar to other web sites, www.lutron.com 
						utilizes a standard technology called cookies (see below) and web server
						logs to accumulate information about traffic on our web site (such as
						the time spent at our web site, the pages viewed, the date and time of
						visits, the web sites visited just before and just after our web site,
						etc.). This information is only collected on an aggregate basis and is
						NOT associated with you as an individual.</p>
				      
						<p>What Are Cookies?</p>
						
						<p>Cookies are a standard feature of web browser software that allows web servers
						to recognize the computer used to access a web site. Cookies are small
						pieces of data that are stored by a user’s web browser on the visitor’s
						hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a visitor accesses on
						one web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that web site by
						the same visitor or to use the information to streamline the visitor’s
						transactions on related web pages. This makes it easier for a visitor to
						move from web page to web page and to complete commercial transactions
						over the Internet.</p>
						
						<p>How Does Lutron Use Information Collected from Cookies?</p>
						
						<p>We use tools such as cookies and web server logs to gather information about customers’ browsing
						activities in order to constantly improve our web site and better serve
						our customers. This information assists us to design and arrange our web
						pages in a user-friendly manner and to continually improve our web site
						to better meet the needs of our current and prospective customers.</p>
						
						<p>Cookies also help us collect important business and technical statistics. The information in the
						cookies lets us trace the paths followed by visitors to our web site as
						they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count
						how many people visit our web site and evaluate our web site’s visitor
						capacity and speed of response. Lutron does not use these technologies
						to capture your individual email address or any personally identifying
						information about you.</p>
						
						<p>Will I Get A Banner Ad or Other Targeted Advertisement Sent To Me?</p>
						
						<p>Anytime you visit a website and have "cookies" enabled, you provide enough information for the
						hosting company to allow other companies to send you "banner
						ads" or other forms of advertisements. This is in spite of the fact
						 that the advertising companies will not be able to associate a specific
						name of a viewer with a corresponding email address.</p>
						
						<p>Lutron does not participate in any revenue-sharing programs with any banner advertising companies, so
						you will never receive a banner ad as a result of a visit to www.lutron.com .</p>
				      
						<p>Sharing Information with Other Companies</p>
						
						<p>Lutron does not share or sell any personal information that visitors voluntarily provide to us on our
						website with any other company, nor do we share any aggregate data we
						collect.</p>
				      
						<p>Notice of New Services and Changes</p>
						
						<p>Once in a while we may notify you via email about important changes to our web site, new products and
						services, or special offers that we believe you will find valuable. You
						will only ever receive these notices if you have elected to receive
						additional communications from us at the time you sign up or register on
						our website. Furthermore, you will always be given an opportunity to
						remove your email address from this list at the end of each electronic
						communication. Finally, we will not attempt to ever contact you via
						phone unless you have specifically given us permission to do.</p>
						
						<p>How Does Lutron Ensure the Security of Credit Card Transactions?</p>
						
						<p>There are two ways a customer can purchase products online at <a href="http://www.lutron.com/">www.lutron.com</a>.
						In both situations customers are purchasing products through an
						authorized Lutron account and NOT directly from Lutron.</p>
				      
						<p>In the first case, Lutron provides links to Lutron accounts that offer their own hosted online
						store where you can purchase (via credit card) a limited number of
						Lutron products. Each one of these companies has their own policy on
						transaction security and handling of private information. You should
						understand how each company uses the information they collect and how
						they maintain the security of their site and credit card transactions
						BEFORE electing to do business with any company. Note that while Lutron
						will only provide initial links to web sites offering Lutron products
						for sale that we believe are using secure transmission technologies, we
						DO NOT continuously monitor these sites and as such can make no
						representations about the current security of these sites.</p>
				      
						<p>In the second instance, Lutron offers customers the ability to purchase some of our products online
						(also via credit card) through an online storefront that is hosted
						directly by Lutron. These storefronts will be identified with a <a href="http://www.lutron.com/">www.lutron.com</a>
						URL, and will display the name of the reseller across the top of each
						page. Once again, the actual transaction will be handled and fulfilled
						by a Lutron reseller and NOT directly by Lutron. However, because we are
						hosting these storefront sites we have more knowledge about the security
						that is used for any credit card transaction. When you send confidential
						personal credit card information to us on our web site, we use a secure
						server software package we have licensed that in turn uses 128 bit
						encryption technologies to encrypt all information you input before it
						is sent to us. The information is scrambled en route and decoded once it
						reaches our web site. The software we are using (Verisign) is the same
						software used today by many of the prominent online retailers.</p>
				      
						<p>Other email that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures will be
						in place prior to your transmitting the information. For that reason,
						please do not send confidential information such as Social Security or
						account numbers to us through an unsecured email.</p>
				      
						<p>What If Lutron Is Legally Compelled to Disclose Information?</p>
				     
						<p>We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith,
						believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal
						rights or our customer’s legal rights.</p>
				      
						<p>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</p>
				      
						<p>We do not monitor the content, information, or web practices of any of web sites linked to or from our
						web site, and as such cannot be held responsible for said content,
						information, or web practices. In particular, while Lutron will only
						provide initial links to web sites offering Lutron products for sale
						that we believe are using secure transmission technologies, we DO NOT
						continuously monitor these sites and as such can make no representations
						about the current security of these sites.</p>
				      
						<p>What Information Does Lutron Retain?</p>
				      
						<p>In addition to retaining aggregate visitor information and personal information you voluntarily
						have provided to us, if you choose to correspond further with us through
						email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with
						your email address and our responses. We provide the same protections
						for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of
						information received by mail and telephone.</p>
				      
						<p>Who Do I Contact If I Have Any Further Questions Regarding Privacy and/or Security?</p>
