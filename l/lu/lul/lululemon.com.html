In addition, lululemon may collect additional information from users of our Services, such as our mobile applications as described in the “Mobile Applications” section below. You represent and warrant that you have the right and authority or have obtained all necessary consents to provide any information, including any personal information of another individual, that is provided by you to lululemon.</p>
<p>lululemon may also collect information that may not be personal information, which may include, but is not limited to, the frequency of user visits to the Sites and Services, the routes by which users access the Sites and Services and use of any hyperlinks available on the Sites and Services. lululemon or its service providers and agents may process and use this aggregate data for various purposes including, but not limited to, analysis of this data for trends and statistics, development of the Sites and Services and the Sites’ and Services’ features and offerings, assessing patterns of use, or planning and evaluating marketing initiatives. This information is gathered by certain tools and methods such as the collection of your IP address or the use of cookies and is maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form unless otherwise noted.</p>
<h2><b>Mobile Applications</b></h2>
<p>lululemon may from time to time offer users the ability to download and use mobile applications. By downloading and/or using these mobile applications, you agree to any applicable Terms of Use, which shall be provided to you when you download the mobile applications and which shall be available at any time during your use of such mobile applications, as well as to this Privacy Policy.
