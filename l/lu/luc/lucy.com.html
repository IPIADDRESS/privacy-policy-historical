<h1>What Information About Me Is Collected and Stored?</h1>

<h3>Information You Provide:</h3>
We collect and store information that you provide on or through the Web Site and that you provide to our Customer Service Department in connection with your access and use of this Web Site. Though you may use portions of this Web Site without providing any Personal Information, in order to take advantage of the full capabilities of this Web Site, you will be required to provide certain Personal Information. For example, you must provide Personal Information in order to place an order or to register for an account on or through this Web Site. We may request, collect and store some or all of the following types of Personal Information: name, billing address, shipping address, e-mail address, telephone number, financial and payment information, such as credit card number and expiration date, and other similar information.

<br><br>

In addition, you may provide certain Personal Information about third parties on or through the Web Site. For example, you must provide us with Personal Information about a third party when you request that we ship an order to a third party or request that we send your "wish list" to a third party. The information collected regarding a third party may include that third party's name, address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, physical address, and other similar information. 

<br><br>

If you provide Personal Information to us, including Personal Information about individuals other than yourself, you represent and warrant: (i) you have the authority to provide that Personal Information and to grant us the right to use that Personal Information consistently with this Privacy Policy, (ii) you have provided that Personal Information voluntarily, and (iii) you consent to the use of that Personal Information in the manner indicated by this Privacy Policy.

<h3>Aggregate and Automatically Collected Information:</h3>
We collect and store certain other non-personally identifiable information automatically whenever you interact with this Web Site. For example, we may collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser information and reference site domain name when you visit this Web Site. 

<br><br>

<b>Use of Cookies/Web Beacons. </b>Like many other web sites, we may collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage by using cookies, web beacons and related technologies. We use the information gathered from cookies, web beacons and related technologies to analyze and understand how the Web Site is used and to enhance your visits to the Web Site. For example, we may use cookies and related technologies to: (i) customize account pages for you, (ii) track user visits and account features, (iii) determine what features and pages are most frequently requested or visited, and (iv) save your password so you do not have to provide it each time you visit the Web Site. "Cookies" are small text files that a web site sends to a user's hard drive through the browser for data storage. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. By disabling or otherwise rejecting cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings on this Web Site. We recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better shopping experience on this Web Site.
<br><br>
We use third-party service providers to provide Internet data hosting and to help us measure and determine how visitors use our Web Site and the effectiveness of our Web Site and promotions in order to help us improve and optimize our Web Site and the products and services we offer. Those third parties may place web beacons or pixel tags on certain pages of our Web Site or use cookies in order to facilitate collection of information regarding your use of the Web Site each time you visit the Web Site. 
<br><br>
In addition, some of our e-mail communications to you may include a "click-through URL" linked to a particular page on the Web Site. By clicking on one of these URLs, you will automatically enter our Web Site and we may collect information related to the "click-through." You may avoid having this information collected by not clicking on URL links in our e-mail communications. 


<br><br><br>

<h1>How is Information Used and Disclosed?</h1>

<h3>Personal Information:</h3>

Personal Information collected on or through this Web Site is used to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations and to provide customer service. If you sign up to our e-mail list or otherwise opt-in to receive promotional communications in connection with this Web Site, we may also use the Personal Information you provide to contact you about sales, special offers and new site features and to send you other promotional communications. You may manage your preferences as described below under "Can I Indicate Whether or Not I Want To Receive Promotional Communications?"

<br><br>

If you request us to ship products to a third party and we are able to determine the information you provided pertains to a third party, we will use the Personal Information you provide regarding that third party only to process and ship the product to that third party and to confirm shipment. In addition, we may retain that Personal Information as reasonably necessary to appropriately document our business activities and for archival and record retention purposes. If you request us to send your "wish list" to a third party, we will use that third party's e-mail address only to send the requested e-mail.

<h3>Aggregate and Automatically Collected Information:</h3>
Automatically collected information is used to analyze and improve this Web Site, gauge the effectiveness of our e-mail communications and your level of interest in particular areas and to provide our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience. 
<br><br>

We do not use automatically collected information to identify a particular user.
