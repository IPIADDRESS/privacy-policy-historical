We recognize that some younger children may not understand some of the information contained on this Web site or how this Web site operates. PLEASE BE SURE TO CAUTION YOUR CHILD UNDER 13 AGAINST PROVIDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ONLINE PRIOR TO THE WEB SITE OPERATOR OBTAINING YOUR CONSENT. It is our policy not to knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 without a parent's or guardian's permission. See our "SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS OF KIDS UNDER 13" below. </p>
<p>Please discuss this Privacy Policy with your children so that they will better understand how to use this Web site and the information they may be asked to provide. We strongly believe that providing our visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the Web site will lead to informed choices and decisions about how to use the Web site, as well as protecting our users' privacy. </p>

<p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong> </p>
<p>Generally, we limit the collection of information to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (e.g., first name, age, state or country).&nbsp; We also collect certain types of personal information such as an email address. This information is collected so that visitors can participate in activities (such as, receiving our e-mail newsletter[s], saving game designs and scores, participating in our question polls). </p>
<p>We have many Web sites that contain different activities for you and your family.&nbsp; Some sites are informational only and some collect your personally identifiable information so that you may participate in different activities.&nbsp; The following sites allow children to register following the receipt of parental consent: <a href="http://www.starwars.com/" target="_blank">www.starwars.com</a> and lucasarts.com. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, our <a href="http://www.starwars.com/" target="_blank">www.starwars.com</a> site includes a paid membership section, Hyperspace membership, which collects additional personally identifiable information which is not collected for free memberships.&nbsp; Free membership registration requires only the collection of your full name, e-mail address and the creation of a screen name.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hyperspace membership in addition requires the collection of your mailing address and credit/debit card information required for purchasing the membership.&nbsp; Hyperspace members have the ability to participate in activities which free members cannot access, such as special forum participation.</p>
<p>In some areas on our Web sites additional personally identifiable information is asked for and collected (for example, full name, mailing address and phone number).&nbsp; This collection is necessary so that our visitors can participate in certain activities, such as online sweepstakes or online promotions. &nbsp;You may not be able to access those areas or participate in such activities without being registered or giving us the necessary personally identifiable information. Whenever we request that you submit such personally identifiable information, we will notify you of our intended use of the information, as more specifically discussed below. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT WE ARE PROHIBITED FROM CONDITIONING A CHILD’S PARTICIPATION IN AN ACTIVITY ON THE CHILD’S DISCLOSING MORE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAN IS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT ACTIVITY. YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE, AND CAN DECLINE TO PROVIDE, ANY REQUESTED INFORMATION AT ANY TIME. HOWEVER, IF YOU DECLINE TO PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO PARTICIPATE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE ACTIVITIES AT THIS WEB SITE. </p>
<p>The types of information collected at this Web site may include: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Contact information, such as      full name, e-mail address and mailing address. </li>
  <li>Financial information and/or      Credit/Debit Card data (for, by way of example, online store purchase      information or for Hyperspace membership). Personal identifiers, such as      screen names and passwords. </li>
  <li>Demographic information, such as      date of birth, age, aggregate information, gender, state and country. </li>
  <li>Internet Protocol (IP)      Information, such as your IP address and browser type. </li>
  <li>Information collected by or held      in "cookies” or collected by Web beacons.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION?:</strong> </p>

The user inputted email addresses in this context are not stored or used for any other purpose other than to send your initial request. </p>
<p><strong>Résumés:</strong> </p>
<p>Some of our sites allow for the online submission of résumés. Personal information collected from résumés is not subject to this Privacy Policy; however, the information submitted will be used solely lawfully, such as for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings or for the purpose of sending candidates who have previously submitted résumés to us information regarding open positions that may fit their submitted information&nbsp; Candidates are able to change or update their information by resubmitting their updated résumés by filling out a new online submission form. </p>
<p><strong>Online Promotions:</strong> </p>

The specific rules and regulations governing the particular promotion will vary and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations. </p>
<p>Certain of these promotions may be co-branded with one of our partners.&nbsp; For example, we may have an online promotion to apply for a credit card offer branded with one of our brands (e.g. Star Wars).&nbsp; In these instances&nbsp; the collection of your personally identifiable information may occur directly by our third party partner on their Web site.&nbsp; The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such information.&nbsp; <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Online Contests and Sweepstakes:</strong> </p>

If you are 13 or older, we may share this demographic and non-personal information with our advertisers, licensees and/or other business partners. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We also use third party service providers to assist in our service offerings.&nbsp; Such providers may include a credit card processing company, an outside shipping agent to fulfill delivery of orders, and an email service provider to facilitate our e-mailings.&nbsp; We will share your personal information with these types of third parties to facilitate functions on our behalf, even if you are under age 13.&nbsp; We require these companies to limit their use of your personally identifiable information to the purpose of fulfilling their services to us.</p>

<p>Other than as explained in this policy, we may disclose personal information (including the personal information of those under 13) in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to: comply with legal processes; respond to any claims; or, protect the rights, property or personal safety of Lucasfilm Ltd., its subsidiaries and affiliates, our customers or the public.

We also provide fun and exciting newsletters, such as the Homing Beacon, and the Padawan Post to tell our users about all of our interesting films, licensed products and services. Our newsletters may include links to independently operated Web sites. Although we do not provide any personally identifiable information about kids under 13 to any "independently-operated Web site" (that is, a Web site not owned, controlled and operated by us), such Web Site(s) may solicit personally identifiable information from kids under 13. Please be aware that we don't control and are not responsible for their actions, privacy policy(ies) or terms of use. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN EITHER OF THESE ACTIVITIES. </p>

<p><strong>Forums/Blogs/Bulletin Boards/Chat Rooms:</strong> </p>
<p>If you use a forum, Blog, bulletin board or chat room on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these activities or &nbsp;forums.</p>
<p><strong>Purchasing Items:</strong> </p>
<p>Purchasing items from various online stores may require the giving of personally identifiable information (such as, name, credit card information).&nbsp; Information collected in this manner will be used consistent with this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Information Collected by Cookies and other Automated Processes:</strong> </p>
<p>We use a software technology called "cookies" to collect non-personally identifiable information. Cookies are pieces of information that we may place on your computer to help "personalize" your visit to the Web site and to allow you to enter our Web site without having to remember and enter any special passwords. For example, a "cookie" will allow us to remember certain things about you, such as your screen name, to track visitor scores or to help you keep track of where you left off in a game. "Cookies" may include the type of browser software you use to access the Internet (i.e. Internet Explorer, Netscape 3.0,), type of operating system (i.e. Windows 95, Mac, etc.), and/or the domain name of your Internet service provider. &nbsp;There are two types of cookies that may be used on our Web site: a persistent cookie and a session cookie. A persistent cookie gets entered by your Web browser into the “Cookies” folder on your computer and remains in this “Cookies” folder after you close your browser. &nbsp;Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to our Web Site. A session cookie is held temporarily in your computer’s memory and disappears after you close your browser or shut off your computer. Our Website may also use Web beacons in conjunction with cookies. Web beacons are small strings of code that are placed in a Web page, (sometimes referred to as "1x1 clear pixel," "Web beacon" or “clear GIF”) in the pages of our Web site in order to gather additional statistical site usage information. </p>
<p>Our Web site may use persistent cookies, Web beacons and information collected in our log files (such as Internet Protocol Address, referring URLs, etc.) about your activity at our Web site to better understand how our Web Site is used, resolve technical problems, and enhance your experience at this site. Information from our Web site analysis cookies or about our Web site usage is not combined with information from any other Web site cookie. &nbsp;The types of statistical information we may gather include the number of visitors to the Lucas Online Web sites, which pages are visited, duration of page views, advertising click-through metrics, the location of visitors prior to accessing their Web site, and details on browsers (including Internet Protocol 'IP' addresses or browser configurations). We use this information to provide Lucas Online with detailed reports and analyses of the traffic to their Web sites. Except with respect to our e-commerce activities (e.g., on-line purchases), we do not link your non-personally identifiable information in "cookies" with personally identifiable information about you. </p>
<p>We may use third-party companies to serve ads or analyze behavior patterns when you visit our Web site. &nbsp;These companies may place or provide ads (such as banner ads) on this Web site that might also place cookies.&nbsp; These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visit to our Web site in order to help us improve our user experience and/or provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the course of providing these services or placing these ads, these third-party companies may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your computer and each of these companies uses this cookie information according to their own privacy and security policies.&nbsp; You can find and evaluate these companies at the end of this Privacy Policy as 'Appendix A,' and we will keep this list updated or you can access this information by <a href="/legal/privacy/index_a.html">clicking here</a>.&nbsp; If you would like more information about this practice and to learn your choices about limiting third party access to such information, <a href="http://www.starwars.com/webapps/registration/feedback/" target="_blank">click here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out:</strong> </p>
<p>If you are 13 or older, you could receive communications from us or from third parties. In that case, you may: (1) opt-out of receiving communications from us by selecting or deselecting the optional e-mail from us on the "Your Account" page to control the messages you receive from us; and/or (2) opt-in or opt-out of receiving communications from third-party sponsors or promotional partners at the time of registration. If you elect to receive these communications, we will transmit the information that you provide to this third party. Note, however, that each third party is governed by a different privacy policy and may have a different method than our Web site to opt-out of future communications. </p>
<p><strong>IP Address and Machine Type:</strong> </p>
<p>An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from our Web site, our servers log your IP address. An IP address does not contain personally identifiable information. Except with respect to our e-commerce activities (e.g., on-line purchases), we do not link IP addresses with personally identifiable information. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. We may also collect information about your browser software and/or machine type (e.g., Windows, Mac, Unix, etc.). </p>
<p><strong>Links:</strong> </p>
<p>We do present links to the Web sites of other parties. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, GET YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE LINKING TO OTHER WEB SITES. Independently operated Web sites are not associated with or authorized by us, even if they have links leading to this Web site. We are not responsible for any content appearing on Web sites linked to or from our Web site, or for any personal information gathered at those independently operated Web sites. </p>
<p><strong>Bumper Pages:</strong> </p>

<p>This Web site gives users options for changing and modifying information previously provided. If you are a registered visitor, you are welcome to view, change or delete your registration information at any time, or to update the contact information we have for you or to inform us that you do not want to receive new product or other information from us. Simply go to the registration page of this Web site. When the welcome screen appears, you can click on "delete or add" or, if available, you can click the "Update Profile" link to update your information. Kids under 13 cannot change registration information, only the parent or guardian can do that. Parents should follow the procedure that they used to enable their child's registration to review, change, or delete any registration information at any time. Parents, you can always ask us to review or delete any of your child's information and you can refuse to permit further collection or use of your child's information at any time by sending us a written request at the Contact Information below. </p>
<p><strong>SPECIAL NOTE TO KIDS:</strong> </p>
<p>If you are under 13 years old, ask your parent or guardian BEFORE giving out any information about yourself, such as your name, age, address or e-mail address. You do not have to give any personal information about yourself. Remember, if you are under 13 you must have your parent or guardian make any changes to information given to us in the past or to update your profile. If you are ever unsure about anything you are seeing on this Web site, ask your parent or guardian for help. If you are 13 years or older, you may have the ability to participate in online contests or sweepstakes, e-mail other users or post messages on portions of this Web site. In the event that you do post messages on this Web site, remember that other users of this Web site may have access to your e-mail address and user name. However, if you participate in online contests, sweepstakes or promotions, you cannot collect any prizes without your parent's or guardian's consent. </p>
<p>If you are under 13, we may knowingly collect your email address, which is personally identifiable information, with your parent’s permission.<strong> </strong>&nbsp;We currently use your email address information in order to send one or more newsletters to you as approved by your parent(s). In addition, following receipt of your parent’s permission we collect your screen name.&nbsp; WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO CREATE A SCREEN NAME WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS OF KIDS UNDER 13:</strong> </p>
<p>We may collect the online contact information in order to obtain parental consent from parents of kids under 13 and/or to provide parental notice by providing a link to this Privacy Policy wherever we have requested personally identifiable information from kids under 13. If a visitor indicates that he/she is under the age of 13, he/she will be asked to supply a parent's or guardian's e-mail address. In this case, the parent or guardian will receive an e-mail message containing instructions on how to enable the child's registration and until the parent or guardian enables the child's registration, the account is disabled. If we do not receive the parent's or guardian's said consent within a reasonable time, we delete this information from our records. If and when we have obtained consent from a parent, we only ask for and collect from a kid under 13 personally identifiable information that is reasonably necessary for that kid to participate in any given activity online. We also may collect this information to respond to a specific request from a kid under 13. Once we respond to a request from a kid under 13, we may not contact that child again and the information is deleted from our records. We take very seriously the safety of children, especially those under 13 and may also collect this information to protect that safety. If we do collect information to protect the safety of your child, we provide notice to you and we do not use that information for any other purpose. You can always ask us to review or delete any of your child's information and you can refuse to permit further collection or use of your child’s information at any time by sending us a written request at the Contact Information below. However, if you ask us to delete your child's information that is necessary to participate in our activities, we may have to ask your child not to participate in our activities. </p>
<p>We do not currently collect, use or disclose personally identifiable information from kids we know to be under 13 absent parental consent.&nbsp; Prior to permitting an individual to access our message boards, we request his or her age. If an individual identifies himself or herself as being under 13, we do not give him or her ability to publicly post, directly communicate with others, or otherwise distribute, personally identifiable information. </p>
