<br><br>
<strong>What information does LucasArts collect and how will it be used?</strong><br>
In order to give you the best experience on our site, LucasArts will collect information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Typically, we ask a user to submit personal and/or demographic information, and it will usually take the form of either: (1) community <a href="/share/webapps/registration/register">registration</a>; (2) Member <a href="/mystarwars/LoginForm.jsp">login</a>; (3) technical <a href="http://support.lucasarts.com">product support</a>; (4) placement of an order for goods or services at our <a href="/companystore">online store</a>; (5) emailing a LucasArts Web page to a friend; (6) email correspondence; and/or, (7) personal information submitted in a business capacity (e.g., <a href="/jobs">resumes</a>).  The types of information requested for each activity and the way the information is used are detailed below.  <br>
<ul>
<li><u>Registration</u><br>
To register for membership in our online community, we ask you to provide personal information such as your name, date of birth, email address, and to create a username and password. We also collect demographic information including your gender, zip code and country in which you live. The information that you submit during registration is used to send you, via our newsletter, the latest news and information regarding new products, notifications of game demo and trailer availability, and other game related announcements. In addition, the registration information allows us to bring you many other benefits, including, access to the LucasArts "Hint Vault," entrance to the "Ask LucasArts" feature, ability to vote in online Polls, and access to other exciting Members Only content on our site (e.g., chat events). We also offer you subscriptions to newsletters from our parent company and its corporate entities (collectively, "affiliates"). You may choose to opt-out from receiving our newsletter or newsletters from our affiliates any time during the registration process by simply unclicking the already checked box by each newsletter. <br><br>
From time to time, as part of our registration process, we may team up with third party companies and organizations to bring you email offers, special promotions and other products or services that may be of interest to you. You will only receive notices of this kind if you opt-in to receive them during the community registration process. We see this as a value-added service helping you find useful products or services, and we strive to provide you only those offers that pertain to the categories you've selected. Please be advised that this service is only available to users 13 years old and older.
</li><br><br>

<li><u>Login</u><br>
Please note that the ability to Sign In (i.e., login) is available to only those Web users that have already created a password during an earlier visit to the community registration area of our site. To login as a member, we ask you to submit your email address and password. This information is collected so that we can easily retrieve, via a cookie, your shopping cart and other preferences. For more information about cookies, please see  <a href="default.htm#cookies">below</a>.   </li><br><br>

<li><u>Product Support</u><br>
To send an email to the LucasArts Technical Support team regarding a problem you encounter with a LucasArts game, we require that you give us your first name and email address in addition to information about the game, console or computer that you are having trouble with. The email address you provide us for this purpose is used only to respond to the sender's troubleshooting problem and is deleted as soon as the response is complete. </li><br><br>

<li><u>Online Store</u><br>
Visitors purchasing goods and services through our online store will need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to name, mailing and billing addresses, phone number and e-mail address. We also ask you to create a password so that when you return to our site, you can login to bring up your contact information, check the status of an order already placed, or place a new order. To login, you will be prompted to provide your last name and password. </li><br><br>
<li><u>Tell a Friend</u><br>
Throughout our site, we provide you the opportunity to email a LucasArts Web page to another person, whether it is a friend, family member, or relative. For this feature of our site to work, we need to collect your email address and the email address(es) of those to whom you want to send the Web page. The email addresses collected in this context are not used for any other purpose, and are deleted once your request has been fulfilled. </li><br><br>
<li><u>Email Correspondence</u><br>
LucasArts may collect and temporarily store personal information that you voluntarily submit to us via email correspondence. For example, LucasArts provides a link through which an online visitor can send e-mail to our Webmaster addressing any issue a user encounters when using our Website. Any personal information contained in such email is used by LucasArts for the sole purpose of responding to your questions. Although most e-mail messages are deleted after they are responded to, in certain cases hard copies or data from certain e-mail correspondence may be kept on file for security purposes. Any such copy or data will also be stored in a secure location, and information from these messages will not be used for marketing purposes. </li> <br><br>
<li><u>Resumes</u><br>
ucasArts allows for the online submission of resumes. Personal information collected from resumes will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings. This information may be shared within our company.</li></ul>

In addition to the uses specified above, we also use your personal and demographic information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs. No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives. 
<br><br>
<strong>What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information?</strong>
<br><br>
If you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities on our site and may considerably limit the services we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to provide your email address when registering, your name will not be entered into sweepstakes that might be offered on our site. Similarly, to access areas of our online community and areas available to Members Only, you must first register with us. To simply use our site, however, you do not need to give us any personal information. 
<br>
<a name="cookies"></a>
<br>
<strong>Does LucasArts use cookies, track IP Addresses or use other passive means to collect information? </strong>
<br><br>
<u>Cookies</u><br>
LucasArts uses a software technology called "cookies" to collect non-personal information about our visitors. Cookies are pieces of information that we may place on your computer to help "personalize" your visit to our Website and to allow you to enter our site without having to remember and re-enter any special passwords. For example, a cookie allows us to remember certain things about you such as your screen name, and lets us track visitor scores or help you keep track of where you left off in a game. In addition, cookies may include information about the type of browser software you use to access the Internet (e.g., Internet Explorer or Netscape 3.0), the type of operating system you use (e.g., Windows 95, Mac, etc.), and/or the domain name of your Internet service provider. Except with respect to our e-commerce activities (i.e., on-line purchases), we do not link your non-personal information collected by cookies with the personal information you voluntarily submit to us online. <br><br>
From time to time, we may allow third party companies to place or provide, on our site, banner ads that drop cookies onto your hard drive. The information collected by such cookies is used in accordance with the privacy and security policies of each third party company. You can find and evaluate these companies by visiting Appendix A on our site or by clicking  <a href="appendixa.htm">here</a>.  We update this list regularly.   <br><br>
Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, some areas of our site might not function properly if you do so. 
<br><br>
<u>IP Addresses</u>
<br>
LucasArts keeps track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Your IP address is typically used to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. 
<br><br>
<strong>Who is collecting my personal information?</strong>
<br><br>
The information you provide to our Web site is collected by LucasArts, and is used in the manner specified  <a href="default.htm#cookies">above</a>.  
<br><br>
<strong>With whom does LucasArts share my personal information?</strong><br>
From time to time, we are approached by third-party companies and organizations that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and we allow them to send out notices to only those LucasArts' Web users who are 13 years old or older and who voluntarily choose to receive them when registering. The personal information that we disclose to these third parties is limited to the information they need to send you email pertinent to the categories you've selected. In addition, these third parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us. Demographic information and profile data, such as gender and Web user game preferences, may also be shared with third-party companies, but only on an aggregate, non-personal basis. 
<br><br>
Other than as explained in this policy, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes; respond to any claims; or, to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of LucasArts, our customers, or the public. In addition, information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, sale, transfer of company assets, or acquisition. 

<br><br>
<strong>What is LucasArts' policy regarding links to other sites?</strong>
<br><br>
You should be aware that while you are on a LucasArts Web site you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control and for which we are not responsible. Because we cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of these Web sites meet our high standards and the requirements of the ESRB Privacy Online Program, we recommend that you read the privacy policy of the Web site to which you link before you submit any personal information. 
<br><br>
<strong>What choices we offer you regarding the use of your personal information?</strong>
<br><br>
If you do not want LucasArts to send you newsletter and/or emails that you alert you to information about games, you can opt-out at the time of registration or information collection. If you have opted-in and, at a later time, you wish to have your name removed from our email database, you can do so online by clicking on the "Update Profile" button found at the Member Services Area of our site. Alternatively, you can contact the Webmaster by phone at (415) 662-1555 or by regular mail at Webmaster, P.O. Box 10228, San Rafael, CA 94912. 
<br><br>
In addition, along with every communication sent to you, LucasArts gives you the opportunity to discontinue receiving further communications (i.e., unsubscribe). 
<br><br>
To unsubscribe to the emails you receive from third party companies regarding email offers and special promotions, please follow the instructions they provide in the emails they send you. 
<a name="access"></a>
<br><br>
<strong>How do I access my personal information?</strong>
<br><br>
If for any reason you are concerned that the personal information maintained by LucasArts is not correct, please update your information online by either: (1) clicking on the "Change your personal information" link that appears at the bottom of the Member Login page; or, (2) clicking on the "Update Profile" button found at the <a name="/register/">Member Services Area</a> of our site. When you press the submit button, your information is automatically updated. 
<br><br>
<strong>Does LucasArts collect personal information from children under 13?</strong>
<br><br>
LucasArts recognizes a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from young children. As such, we encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children, and instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet. 
<br><br>
<u>Parental Consent</u><br>
Before we can allow a child under 13 to register on our site, we must obtain verifiable consent from the child's parent. In order to obtain consent, we ask the child to submit personal information, including, the child's first name, date of birth, email address, and parent's email address. This information is used to inform the parent, via email, of our policies with respect to children under 13 and how the parent can provide consent to us online. If the parent chooses not to consent, the child's information is deleted and removed from our records. Once we have obtained parental consent, we only ask the child for information that is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in our online activities. In addition, we will use the child's personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
In some instances, a child can submit personal information to us online even without their parents' prior permission. For example, LucasArts does not require verifiable parental consent if a child under 13 wishes to use the Product Support and "Tell a Friend" features of our site. The information collected in these areas is used to fulfill a one-time request from the child (e.g., answer the child's technical support question) and is deleted once that request has been fulfilled. 
<br><br>
<u>Parental Access</u><br>
A parent who has given LucasArts permission to collect and use his or her child's information can, at any time, do the following: (1) view, correct or remove the child's personal information; (2) discontinue further use of the child's information and/or communication with the child; and/or, (3) revoke his or her earlier consent to collect and use the child's information. To take any such action, simply follow the instructions provided  <a href="default.htm#access">above</a> (under heading, "How do I access my personal information?"). For verification purposes, we may ask you to provide the email address and password your child used to register before you can access, update, or delete the rest of his profile. 
 
<br><br>
<strong>What safeguards does LucasArts use to protect my personal information?</strong>
<br><br>
LucasArts maintains appropriate safeguards that ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the personal information we collect. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Here are some examples of how we safeguard your personal information: (1) personal information collected by LucasArts is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public (e.g., locked rooms) and is only accessible from specific computers within our control; (2) the LucasArts online store uses industry-standard technology (e.g., encryption) to prevent unauthorized electronic access to sensitive financial information such as your credit card number; and, (3) we take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer data–-for such purposes as sending an special offers and promotions to LucasArts' Web users -- provide sufficient protection of such personal data. 

<br><br>
<strong>CHANGES</strong><br><br> 
<strong>Our Changes</strong> <br>
We reserve the right to change or remove this privacy policy at our discretion. If we decide to change our privacy policy we will post those changes here. We encourage you to visit this area frequently to stay informed. We will tell you via e-mail if we make any material changes in how we collect, use or wish to share your child's information in any manner not previously authorized by you. <br><br>
<strong>Your Changes </strong><br>
This Web site gives users options for changing and modifying information previously provided. If you are a registered visitor, you are welcome to view, change or delete your registration information at any time, or to update the contact information we have for you or to inform us that you do not want to receive new product or other information from us. Simply go to the registration page of this Web site using the same computer from which you initially registered. When the welcome screen appears, you can click on "delete or add". Kids under 13 cannot change registration information, only the parent or guardian can do that. Parents should follow the procedure that they used to enable their child's registration to review, change, or delete any registration information at any time. Parents, you can always ask us to review or delete any of your child's information and you can refuse to permit further collection or use of your child's information at any time by sending us a written request at the Contact Information below. 

<a name="kids"></a>
<br><br>
<strong>SPECIAL NOTE TO KIDS</strong><br>
If you are under 13 years old, ask your parent or guardian BEFORE giving out any information about yourself, such as your name, age, address or e-mail address. You do not have to give any personal information about yourself. Remember, if you are under 13 you must have your parent or guardian make any changes to information given to us in the past or to update your profile. If you are ever unsure about anything you are seeing on this Web site, ask your parent or guardian for help. <br><br>
If you are 13 years or older, you may have the ability to participate in online contests or sweepstakes, e-mail other users or post messages on portions of this Web site. In the event that you do post messages on this Web site, remember that other users of this Web site may have access to your e-mail address and user name. However, if you participate in online contests, sweepstakes or promotions, you cannot collect any prizes without your parent's or guardian's consent. 
<br><br>
<strong>SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS OF KIDS UNDER 13</strong><br>
We may collect the name of a child or parent and online contact information in order to obtain parental consent to parents of kids under 13 or to provide parental notice. If a visitor indicates that he/she is under the age of 13, he/she will be asked to supply a parent's or guardian's e-mail address. In this case, the parent or guardian will receive an e-mail message containing instructions on how to enable the child's registration and until the parent or guardian enables the child's registration, the account is disabled. If we do not receive the parent's or guardian's said consent within a reasonable time, we delete this information from our records. We also may collect this information to respond to a specific request from a child under 13. Once we respond to a request from a child under 13, we may not contact your child again and the information is deleted from our records. We take very seriously the safety of children, especially those under 13 and may also collect this information to protect that safety. If we do collect information to protect the safety of your child, we provide notice to you and we do not use that information for any other purpose. You can always ask us to review or delete any of your child's information at any time by sending us a written request at the Contact Information below and you can ask that we do not use or collect any more personal information from your child. However, if you ask us to delete your child's information that is necessary to participate in our activities, we may have to ask your child not to participate in our activities.
