<br>
                               If this Web site has a registration procedure, our Web site's registration
                               form requires users to give us contact information, unique identifiers,

                               <b>Online Contests and Sweepstakes:</b>
<br>
                               We or our advertisers, licensees and/or other business partners may
                               sponsor contests or sweepstakes which may be entered online. The

                               GUARDIAN'S CONSENT TO COLLECT YOUR PRIZE OR RECEIVE
                               YOUR BENEFIT. We use the information you provide when placing an
                               order, entering a game, entering a contest or sweepstake or when we
                               complete an order and/or fulfill a prize. We use return e-mail addresses
                               to answer the e-mail that we receive, and we may use return e-mail to
                               communicate with you or to send you other information. If you are under
                               13 (with your parent's or guardian's consent), or if you are over 13 but
                               not an adult, the information collected for contests or sweepstakes
                               include your first name, e-mail address and your parent's e-mail
                               address and, if you win, before your prize is collected, your parent or
                               guardian is sent an e-mail informing them of your award and explaining
                               the nature and terms and conditions of the sweepstakes. Your parent or
                               guardian will then have a chance to "opt out" of collecting your prize on
                               your behalf, in which case the prize will not be awarded.

                               <b>Cookies:</b>
<br>
                               We use a software technology called "cookies" to collect non-personally
                               identifiable information. Cookies are pieces of information that we may
                               place on your computer to help "personalize" your visit to the Web site
                               and to allow you to enter our Web site without having to remember and
                               enter any special passwords. For example, a "cookie" will allow us to
                               remember certain things about you, such as your screen name, to track
                               visitor scores or to help you keep track of where you left off in a game.
                               "Cookies" may include the type of browser software you use to access
                               the Internet (i.e. Internet Explorer, Netscape 3.0,); type of operating
                               system (i.e. Windows 95, Mac, etc.), and/or the domain name of your
                               Internet service provider. Except with respect to our e-commerce
                               activities (e.g., on-line purchases), we do not link your non-personally
                               identifiable information in "cookies" with personally identifiable information about you.
</p><p>
  								In addition, some companies place or provide banner ads
								on this Web site that might also place cookies. Each of these companies use this
  								cookie information according to their own privacy and security policies. You
								can find and evaluate these companies at the end of this Privacy Policy as
							   'Appendix A,'  and we will keep this list updated.

								<b>Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out:</b>
<br>
If you are over the age of 12 you could receive communications from us or from third parties.  In that case, you may:  (1) opt-out of receiving communications from us by selecting or deselecting the optional e-mail from us on the "Your Account" page to control the messages you receive from us; and/or  (2) opt-in or opt-out of receiving communications from third-party sponsors or promotional partners at the time of registration.

                               <b>IP Address and Machine Type:</b>
<br>
                               An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer
                               whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that
                               "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP
                               address. When you request a page from our Web site, our servers log
                               your IP address. An IP address does not contain personally identifiable
                               information. Except with respect to our e-commerce activities (e.g.,
                               on-line purchases), we do not link IP addresses with personally
                               identifiable information. We may use your IP address to help diagnose
                               problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP
                               address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to
                               gather broad demographic information. We may also collect information
                               about your browser software and/or machine type (e.g., Windows, Mac,
                               Unix, etc.).

<br>
                               We do create links to the Web sites of other parties. IF YOU ARE
                               UNDER 13, GET YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT
                               BEFORE LINKING TO OTHER WEB SITES. Independently-operated
                               Web sites are not associated with or authorized by us and may also
                               have links leading to this Web site. We cannot control any of these links
                               and are not responsible for any content appearing on Web sites linked
                               to or from our Web site, or for any personal information gathered at

                               <b>Bumper Pages:</b>
<br>
                               We sometimes provide a "bumper page" when linking from our Web
                               site to an independently-operated Web site, which lets you know you
                               are going to an independently-operated Web site and reminds them not
                               to give out information online without their parent's permission.

                               secure. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and
                               managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. In

                               servers, it is only accessible from specific computers within our control.
                               We have and will continue to take reasonable measures to assure the
                               security and accuracy of all information our visitors share with us. Our

                               manner not previously authorized by you. We will require third parties
                               with whom we have written agreements involving the sharing of
                               personally identifiable information of kids under 13 to agree to protect

                               This Web site gives users options for changing and modifying
                               information previously provided. If you are a registered visitor, you are
                               welcome to view, change or delete your registration information at any
                               time, or to update the contact information we have for you or to inform us
                               that you do not want to receive new product or other information from us.
                               Simply go to the registration page of this Web site using the same
                               computer from which you initially registered. When the welcome screen
                               appears, you can click on "delete or add". Kids under 13 cannot change
                               registration information, only the parent or guardian can do that. Parents
                               should follow the procedure that they used to enable their child's
                               registration to change any information at any time.

                               <b>SPECIAL NOTE TO KIDS:</b>
<br>
                               If you are under 13 years old, ask your parent or guardian BEFORE
                               giving out any information about yourself, such as your name, age,
                               address or e-mail address. You do not have to give any personal
                               information about yourself. Remember, if you are under 13 you must
                               have your parent or guardian make any changes to information given to
                               us in the past or to update your profile. If you are ever unsure about
                               anything you are seeing on this Web site, ask your parent or guardian
                               for help.
</p><p>
                               If you are 13 years or older, you may have the ability to participate in
                               online contests or sweepstakes, e-mail other users or post messages
                               on portions of this Web site. In the event that you do post messages on

                              <b> SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS OF KIDS UNDER 13</b>:<br>
                              We may collect
                               the name of a child or parent and online contact information in order to
                               obtain parental consent to parents of kids under 13 or to provide
                               parental notice. If a visitor indicates that he/she is under the age of 13,
                               he/she will be asked to supply a parent's or guardian's e-mail address.
                               In this case, the parent or guardian will receive an e-mail message
                               containing instructions on how to enable the child's registration and until
                               the parent or guardian enables the child's registration, the account is
                               disabled. If we do not receive the parent's or guardian's said consent
                               within a reasonable time, we delete this information from our records.
                               We also may collect this information to respond to a specific request
                               from a child under 13. Once we respond to a request from a child under
                               13, we may not contact your child again and the information is deleted
                               from our records. We take very seriously the safety of children,
                               especially those under 13 and may also collect this information to
                               protect that safety. If we do collect information to protect the safety of
                               your child, we provide notice to you and we do not use that information
                               for any other purpose. You can always ask us to review or delete any of
                               your child's information at any time by sending us a written request at
                               the Contact Information below and you can ask that we do not use or
                               collect any more personal information from your child. However, if you
                               ask us to delete your child's information that is necessary to participate
                               in our activities, we may have to ask your child not to participate in our
                               activities.
