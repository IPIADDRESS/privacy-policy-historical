We will post changes to this Website, and we reserve the right to make changes without prior individual notice. Such changes are effective upon posting.

<p><strong>California Privacy Rights. </strong>Under California law, California residents who have provided personally identifiable information to a company may have the right to request a list of all third parties to whom that company had disclosed such information for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, along with a list of the categories of Personal Information that had been so disclosed. However, Lucky Peach’s policy, as disclosed on this Website, does not currently permit Lucky Peach to share the Personal Information collected at this Website about you with non-affiliated third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Moreover, even if Lucky Peach’s policy permitted the disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes, because Lucky Peach provides you with an opportunity to opt out of such disclosure, Lucky Peach does not have to provide you with such lists. If you are a California resident who would like information on how to exercise your rights concerning third party disclosures, you may send an email to or contact us via postal mail at:</p>

<p><strong>Collection and Use of Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Personal Information is information that uniquely identifies you, such as your name, address, email address and telephone number.</p>

If you are purchasing goods at our website, you may be asked to provide certain financial information, such as credit card information to our payment processers. We may also collect your Personal Information if you post, display and/or publish content on the Website. Additionally, when you enter any password-protected area of this Website, then this Website will recognize who you are and will collect information that you submit. Any information collected about you from this Website may be associated with other information that Lucky Peach has collected about you.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Information.</strong> Our payment processers collect and use financial information and/or payment method to process your payment for any purchases or sales made on the Website, to protect against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as may be reasonably needed to manage our business in connection with your transaction. With your opt-in, this financial data may be retained by our payment processors after your transaction has been completed.</p>

This aggregate tracking information is used to help Lucky Peach improve and enhance the website experience for all of its visitors.</p>
<p><strong>Your Consent</strong></p>
<p>We only collect, use and/or disclose your Personal Information with your consent. Your consent may be implied from the circumstances or may be expressly given for a particular purpose. For example, when you submit your Personal Information to us and post to our website, you are consenting to the collection, handling, use and disclosure of your Personal Information for the purposes identified or apparent at the time of collection and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You must be 18 years of age to use the Website. Lucky Peach does not knowingly collect or maintain any Personal Information from children under the age of 13, and no part of this website is designed with the purpose of attracting such children.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Your Personal Information</strong></p>

<li>to analyze the success of our products and Website,</li>

<li>for compliance with Lucky Peach’s legal and regulatory obligations,</li>
<li>as otherwise reasonably required to provide customer services and maintain the Website, and,</li>
<li>for any other purpose outlined in this Privacy Policy and/or the Terms of Use of which this Privacy Policy is a part.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also use your Personal Information to contact you via direct postal mail and/or electronically to the extent such activity is permitted by law, regarding your relationship with Lucky Peach. This information may also be used to help Lucky Peach and its commercial partners deliver targeted advertisements, promotions and other initiatives to you.</p>
<p><strong>Opting in and opting out of electronic communications.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; At certain points where Personal Information is collected on our site, there may be a box to indicate that you wish to receive certain information or communications from Lucky Peach. You may opt out of receiving electronic communications, such as emails from Lucky Peach at any time. In all of our electronic communications you will be given the opportunity to opt out of receiving future communications.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may also opt-out by sending an email to our Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:mail@lky.ph">mail@lky.ph</a> providing the contact information we are using to communicate with you, such as your email address. Be sure to let us know the specific types of communications you no longer wish to receive.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Your Personal Information Within Lucky Peach.</strong> In order to provide you with efficient and reliable services and to improve product and service options available to you, Lucky Peach may share your Personal Information with our affiliated entities as required or permitted by applicable law. Our affiliates are companies controlled or owned by us, or companies that control us, or are under common control with us.</p>
<p><strong>Our Service Providers.</strong> From time to time, we may hire third parties to assist us with certain functions and services, such as data processing, computer software and website maintenance and development, transaction processing, promotional and marketing services, customer service, professional, legal or accounting services and/or business and sales analysis. Lucky Peach may share your Personal Information, without restriction (and regardless of whether you have chosen to limit our sharing of your Personal Information as collected on the Website), with such companies that we hire to perform services for us. In such situations, Lucky Peach requires that these companies agree to maintain the confidentiality of your Personal Information and to comply with the safeguards described in this Privacy Policy. These companies have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes. Furthermore, in compliance with privacy laws, we also provide our opt-out lists to non-affiliated third party companies so that they can be suppressed from the communications those companies send on Lucky Peach’s behalf.</p>
<p><strong>If Lucky Peach changes ownership.</strong> We may also share your Personal Information as required to allow for a change in ownership of any of Lucky Peach’s affiliated entities, and/or of any business(es) to which the Website relates, and the related transfer of user information to the new owner. In the event of any such change of ownership, your Personal Information will continue to be protected by the terms of this Privacy Policy unless and until you are notified of a change.</p>
<p><strong>Lawful access, legal action and investigations.</strong> Your Personal Information may be disclosed to non-affiliated third parties as either permitted by, or to comply with, applicable laws and regulations. Your Personal Information may be transmitted through and stored on servers outside your home country, and may be accessed by authorities in those jurisdictions. We may disclose Personal Information if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities or fraud, situations involving the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or otherwise in accordance with applicable law. For example, Lucky Peach may disclose your Personal Information to comply with investigations by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies in the United States of America or elsewhere, or to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud. Furthermore, Lucky Peach may disclose your Personal Information if it has a reasonable good faith basis to believe that it is required to do so by law, compelled by court order or legal process, or is reasonably necessary and/or appropriate to: (i) protect the rights, property and/or safety of Lucky Peach or any other person or entity; or (ii) prevent or take action concerning any alleged: (a) illegal activity or (b) breach of the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy of this Website.</p>
