This policy was revised on October 10, 2000. Please take a few moments to review it. 
<br>
<br>
            This policy covers all sites produced by CondéNet, including 
            CondeNet.com, Epicurious.com, Concierge.com, STYLE.com, Glamour.com, 
            Swoon.com, and all Condé Nast magazine subscription sites. 
            This policy does not cover information collected on sites linked from 
            CondéNet sites. <br>
<br>
CondéNet sites are committed to bringing you information that's tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, to protecting your privacy. The following is a summary of the various ways we treat the information you provide us while using our sites.
<br>
<br>
CondéNet only collects personally identifying information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you register for our services, enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey or subscribe to our magazines, you are asked to provide information such as your email address, name, or phone number. Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested.
<br>
<br>
CondéNet uses this information to provide you with the service you have requested. For example, if you subscribe to one of our magazines, we will use your email address to send you a confirmation notice and your address to send you your magazine. Similarly, if you enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. We may also use this information to send you regular email newsletters, inform you about new features, products or services, or other changes to the services. 
<br>
<br>
CondéNet does not sell any of our users' personal information. We may, however, share information with carefully selected companies who we think can offer you services and products of interest to you. If you do not wish to have your information shared, write to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@condenast.com" class="link">privacy@condenast.com</a>. If you do not wish to receive communications from us, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the email. If you've registered for any of our sites, you may also change or update your member preferences or information on your member's page on each site.
<br>
<br>
You may have read about "cookies," nuggets of information that are placed by a Web site in a storage place on your own computer. We use cookies for purposes such as to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns on the site or to record registration and personalization information. For example, if you register you can opt to save your user name and password on your computer. We can provide this convenience by placing a cookie on your computer. 
<br>
<br>
Our cookies do not contain any information that is, in itself, personally identifying.
<br>
<br>
Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.
<br>
<br>
If you don't want cookies, your Web browser likely includes an option that allows you not to accept them. We don't recommend using this option, though: It makes browsing our site a less enjoyable experience.
<br>
<br>
We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or forums software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide you with those services. Any third party who has access to our database for this purpose is bound by the terms set forth in this policy. There may also be occasion when we are legally required to provide access to our database in order to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings. In those instances, the information is provided only for that purpose. 
<br>
<br>
Finally, while your individual information is protected as outlined above, we reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.
<br>
<br>
KIDS: CondéNet sites are not intended for use by children, especially those under age 13. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information or use our public discussion areas, forums, and chats. Minors under the age of 18 are prohibited from making purchases, including subscriptions, on our sites.
<br>
<br>
If your kids disclose information about themselves in our public discussion areas, they may get unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, you should tell them not to do so.
<br>
<br>
If you're worried about your kids' activities or their privacy on our sites, we encourage you to email our Privacy Policy Coordinator at <a href="mailto:privacy@condenast.com" class="link">privacy@condenast.com</a>.
<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; notice of changes will appear on this page, so check back often. Any such changes will be prospective, never retroactive.
<br>
<br>
If you have concerns or questions about any aspect of this policy, please email our Privacy Policy Coordinator at <a href="mailto:privacy@condenast.com" class="link">privacy@condenast.com</a>. We welcome your feedback. You can also send us regular mail at the following address:
