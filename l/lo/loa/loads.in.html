<p>Some CA products or services use the Google Maps APIs and as to such products or services, CA incorporates by reference the Google privacy policy located at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html">http://www.google.com/privacy.html</a>, as amended by Google from time to time.</p>

We have taken appropriate steps to safeguard and secure information we collect online, including the use of encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information. However, you should always take into consideration that the internet is an open forum and that data may flow across networks with little or no security measures, and therefore such information may be accessed by people other than those you intended to access it.</p>

<h2 class="marb30">Q: What are your practices regarding cookies and/or web beacons?</h2>
<p>CA uses third party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These third party companies employ cookie and web beacon (also referred to as 1x1 pixel.gifs or action tags) technology to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. Cookies are also used to help us track usage patterns in order to improve or manage our site, to ensure the integrity of the registration process, and to help provide personalized service and deliver content specific to your interests. A "cookie" is a small amount of data transferred to your browser and read by the Web server that placed it there. It works as a sort of identification card, recording your preferences and previously entered information. By using cookies, the information you previously provided can be retrieved on your next visit to the website so that your navigation time is reduced and your use of the website is simplified. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie. Web beacons may be used to deliver the cookie and to compile statistics about our website, such as how many people visited a particular page or clicked on certain links. While your particular use of the site will not be revealed and no personally identifying information will be collected, this anonymous information may be used for online preference marketing purposes, and CA's third party advertising companies may use the information about your visit to the website(s) in order to provide ads about goods and services of interest to you. This information can include: date/time of banner ad shown, related cookie, and the first three octets of the IP address. CA may share aggregated statistics about the use of the website with third parties. CA Technologies does not currently respond to the browser DNT signals on its own websites or online services, or on third-party websites or online services where CA Technologies provides advertisements, content or is otherwise able to collect information. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can set your browser to decline cookies if you prefer. If you do so, you may not be able to get the benefit of some of the features of this website or other websites that you visit.</p>
