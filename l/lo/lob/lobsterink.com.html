All terms and conditions, including defined terms, of our Website Terms and Conditions, are incorporated by reference into this Privacy Policy and have the same meaning unless the context indicates otherwise. In the event of any conflict between any terms in our Website Terms and Conditions and the terms of this Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy shall prevail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Personal Information” means any information that we have about you and that identifies or relates specifically to you as an individual.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>GENERAL TERMS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lobster Ink receives Personal Information from Users who access the Website. Lobster Ink makes every effort to protect Personal Information received by it, and in this regard, the Privacy Policy set out below applies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite all security measures taken, it is possible for Internet-based communications to be intercepted. Without the use of encryption, the Internet is not a secure medium and privacy cannot be ensured. Internet e-mail is vulnerable and susceptible to interception and forging. Lobster Ink will not be responsible for any damages the User or any third party may suffer as a result of the transmission of confidential or personal information that the User submits to Lobster Ink through the Internet, or that the User expressly or implicitly authorises Lobster Ink to receive, or for any errors or any changes made to any transmitted information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are committed to the protection of your privacy and will take all reasonable steps to protect any Personal Information that you may provide us with from time to time via the Website or any other channel or medium. Our Privacy Policy indicates what we do with your Personal Information and what you can do to protect that information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where you submit Personal Information to us via our Website, we may store and use such information for the purposes that you provided it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will take reasonable measures to delete Personal Information that has become obsolete. Over the period that your Personal Information is being used and for a period of at least one year thereafter, or such longer period as we may be required or entitled in terms of any law, we will keep a record of your Personal Information and the purpose for which it is stored. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should you so request, in writing, we will delete your Personal Information save where we are required or entitled to preserve same in terms of any law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You acknowledge and accept that we cannot take any responsibility for any of your Personal Information that is collected outside the scope of this agreement by any intermediary or other third party. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You give permission that if there is a change of ownership at Lobster Ink, then your Personal Information can be transferred to the new owner, provided that the new owner will not dilute your rights and obligations regarding the Personal Information as set out in this privacy policy that had been collected before such transfer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Personal Information will not be sold, divulged or made available to any third party except as mentioned in this policy and unless required or permitted by law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You as the User hereby acknowledge and agree as follows:</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you relieve Lobster Ink of the duty to inform you each time of the fact that your Personal Information is being collected and whether the provision of this information is voluntary or mandatory and what law requires such collection; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if any of your Personal Information which is sought to be processed falls within the definition of ‘special personal information’ as defined by any law, you hereby give your consent to the processing of such information.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") or the country in which you are located. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA or the country in which you are located. This includes staff engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your Personal Information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. Lobster Ink will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
