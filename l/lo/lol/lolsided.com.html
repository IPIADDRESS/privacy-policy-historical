        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Do we use cookies?</b><br>
            Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

                <li>Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.</li>
            </ul>
        You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies.

        <p>
            <b>Google.</b>
            Google’s advertising requirements can be summed up by Google’s Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</b><br>
            Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network privacy policy.<br><br>
            We have implemented the following:
        </p><ul>
            <li>Remarketing with Google AdSense</li>
            <li>Google Display Network Impression Reporting</li>
            <li>Demographics and Interests Reporting</li>
            <li>DoubleClick Platform Integration</li>
        </ul>
        We along with third-party vendors, such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to our website.

        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Fair Information Practices.</b><br>
            The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

            <br><br>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:<br><br>

            We will notify the users via email within 3 business days.<br>
            We will notify the users via in-site notification within 3 business days.<br><br>

We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>CAN SPAM Act.</b><br>
            The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.<br><br>
            We collect email addresses in order to:
            </p><ul>
                <li>Send user notifications / updates (example: somebody responds to a post that you created).</li>
                <li>To notify users about new features.</li>
                <li>Decrease the possibility of "dummy" / fake user accounts.</li>
                <li>Send newsletters.</li>
            </ul>
