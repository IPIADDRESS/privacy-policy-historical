We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.<br> We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.<br> We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the lolzepic&nbsp;Website.<br> We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.<br> lolzepic&nbsp;also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that lolzepic&nbsp;believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our lolzepic&nbsp;Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of lolzepic, our Users or others.<br> Your Choices</p><p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the lolzepicWebsite, in which case lolzepic&nbsp;may not be able to provide certain services to you.

The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Lolstuffs&nbsp;Website, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.</p><p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. lolzepic’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web Website.</p><p>Our Commitment To Data Security</p><p>Lolstuffs&nbsp;uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.
