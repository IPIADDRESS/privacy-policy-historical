			to the information. We audit our security systems and processes on a

			functionally deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use 
			Personally Identifiable Information relating to that individual in 
			any way moving forward.</font></span></p>

			We will let our Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes 
			to our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site. However,
