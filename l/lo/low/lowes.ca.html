                    Lowe's Companies Canada, ULC, its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Lowe's") value and
                    respect the privacy of its customers, employees and suppliers.</p>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Statement informs you of Lowe's privacy practices and of the choices
                    you can make about the way your information is collected and how that information
                    is used.</p>

                    Lowe's Privacy Statement governs the collection, use and disclosure of personal
                    information. Lowe's Privacy Statement does not apply to information that is not
                    included in the definition of "personal information" in applicable privacy statutes.</p>
                <p>
                    Lowe's is a global organization with legal entities, business processes, management
                    structures, and technical systems that cross international borders. This Privacy
                    Statement applies to all physical locations in Canada, Canadian websites and domains,
                    such as <a href="http://www.lowes.ca">www.lowes.ca</a>, and the websites, domains and physical locations of any wholly
                    owned Canadian subsidiaries, unless a statement posted on any Lowe's website or
                    at any Lowe's physical location states that a different privacy statement applies
                    to a particular Lowe's subsidiary, promotion, program or service.</p>

                    Lowe's may also collect information during your visit to a Lowe's website through

                    certain standard information that your browser sends to its website such as your
                    browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website that directed
                    you to the Lowe's website. They may also collect information about your Internet

                    the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with Lowe's websites)
                    and product information. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned
                    to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate
                    and identify your computer. Computers use IP addresses to communicate on the Internet
                    and to allow users to browse and shop. Lowe's aggregates the data it collects about
                    you with data on the pages visited by other users to track overall visitor traffic
                    patterns. This information does not identify you personally and is used to make

                    <b>A. How Lowe's Obtains Your Consent</b><br>
                    You provide your express consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal
                    information in accordance with this Privacy Statement when you voluntarily provide
                    the requested information. You provide your implied consent to the use of Automatic
                    Data Collection Tools by your continued use of the Lowe's website. You provide your
                    implied consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information with
                    respect to video surveillance by entering Lowe's stores or other facilities. In
                    some instances, the law permits Lowe's to collect, use and disclose personal information
                    obtained from public sources without your consent. If Lowe's obtains information
                    from third parties other than such public sources, Lowe's requires those third parties
                    to confirm that they have your consent to disclose your personal information for
                    use by Lowe's.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>B. Withdrawal of Consent</b><br>
                    You have the right to withdraw your consent to the further collection, use and disclosure
                    of your personal information. If you request Lowe's to do so, Lowe's will take steps
                    to destroy or delete active personal information that you have provided to us. Residual
                    personal information may remain in archived records or other historical records.
                    In addition, Lowe's is not permitted to destroy business or accounting records of
                    transactions that it is required to keep to: comply with statutory or other legal
                    obligations, assert its legal rights or comply with its obligations to the provider
                    of the debit or credit card you used. However, Lowe's will not use your personal
                    information for other commercial purposes once you withdraw your consent.</p>
                <p>
                    In some circumstances, the withdrawal of consent to certain uses or disclosures
                    of personal information may mean that Lowe's is no longer able to provide certain

                                    Lowe's may also use web beacons. Web beacons allow Lowe's to know if a certain page
                                    was visited, if an email was opened or if its advertisements were effective. A Web
                                    beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF. Web beacons
                                    can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the
                                    time and date of a page viewed, and a description of the page where the Web beacon
                                    is placed.

                                    You may be able to disable web beacons in e-mail messages by not downloading images
                                    contained in the message you receive (this feature varies depending on the e-mail
                                    software used on your personal computer). However, doing this may not always disable
                                    a web beacon or other automatic data collection tools in the e-mail message due
                                    to specific e-mail software capabilities. For more information about this, please

                                    Web, after redirection through Lowe's servers. The redirection system allows Lowe's
                                    to change the destination URL of these links, if necessary, and to determine the
                                    effectiveness of our marketing initiatives.

                                    In e-mails, such web links may also allow Lowe's to determine whether you have clicked
                                    a link in an e-mail, and this information about the interaction may be connected
                                    to your personal identity. If you do not want Lowe's to collect information about
                                    the links that you click, you can change your choice about how you receive communications
                                    from Lowe's (i.e. choose a text-based version of the message where available) or
