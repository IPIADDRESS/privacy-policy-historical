<br>

In addition, we might receive information about you from other sources (such as service providers) for tracking purposes. LowerMyBills.com may add the information we receive about you to your existing account.
Like other websites, we also automatically receive and record certain types of information every time you visit us.  We use "<a href="#010">Cookies</a>" and the other information to enhance your experience and present you with personalized offers.  Likewise, we sometimes use third-party advertising companies to serve and track advertisements appearing on our website.

<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Processing Your Requests: </b>If you apply for a product or service offered through
   LowerMyBills, we will share your information with certain business partners strictly to process and fulfill your
   request . Our business partners may contact you by telephone in order to process and fulfill your request even
   if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission. If one of our
   business  partners contacts you by telephone and you wish not to be contacted again by that business partner
   with respect to  your inquiry or application, then you should specifically make a request to that business partner to
   not contact you  again. If the business partner disregards your request and contacts you again, please let us know
   immediately by  sending an email to <a href="mailto:CustomerCare@lowermybills.com">CustomerCare@lowermybills.com</a>. Our business partners may also contact
   you to process your request by email or mail based on the information you have provided to us.  Such partners may keep such information whether you elect to use their services or not.  If you do not want to receive such communications from them, please notify the business partner directly. <br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Contracted Partners: </b>We sometimes disclose the information we collect to companies that perform marketing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;services on our behalf. These partners only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and may not share it with others or use it for any other purpose. These companies are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit using the information except to market the specified LowerMyBills.com products or services.<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Legal Protection:</b> We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, and will establish or exercise our legal rights and defend against legal claims.

<b><font color="000066">Cookies</font></b>
<br>
To serve you faster and with better quality, we use "cookies" technology. Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive, which enable a Web site to "personalize" itself for each user. We generally use cookies to reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer and to assist with customer tracking. Customer tracking (or "click-stream") data collected by us is used to optimize your experience by learning whether or not you successfully used LowerMyBills.com.  Additionally, we may capture click-stream data on some of our partner's websites, limited to the activity involved with the completion of offers listed on our website. This information is used to monitor the performance of our partners.

<br>
<br>
<b><font color="000066">Clear Gifs</font></b>
<br>
We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movement of Web users. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information. We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails the recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section.
