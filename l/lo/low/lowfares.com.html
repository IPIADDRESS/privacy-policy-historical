        process: In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a
        court order, or a request for cooperation from any law enforcement or
        other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to
        defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such
        cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us
        in our sole discretion. In addition, we may disclose your information when
        we believe it is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate,
        prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud
        or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety
        of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with
        applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce the Site
        terms of use or other agreements or policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><u>Aggregated and Non-Personal Information</u>. We may rent, sell, or share aggregated demographic
    information not specifically identifiable to you, and other non-personal
    information we collect, with any third parties for any reason, including to
    develop and deliver customized advertising, and to conduct general business
    analysis. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional
    non-personal information collected from other sources. For example, we may tell
    our advertisers the number of visitors to the Site and the most popular
    features or Services accessed.</p>

    <p>Please
    note that our Privacy Policy does not cover any third party's use or handling
    of your information once it is shared. Rather, the privacy policies of the
    various third parties will govern. If you want to learn more about their
    privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third
    parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or
    outside the United States.</p>

    <p><u>Links</u>. This Site
    contains links to other websites, including through advertisements. We are not
    responsible for the privacy practices of third party linked websites, even if
    this Site frames the linked third party website. We encourage you to be aware
    of when you leave the Site and to review the privacy statements of each and
    every website that you visit that collects personally identifiable information.
    This Privacy Policy applies solely to information we collect.</p>

    <p><b>Choice/Opt Out</b></p>

    <p>We give our users the opportunity to
    "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to
    the Site at the point where we ask for the information, including the sharing
    of personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes. Please be aware that this may result in our not being able
    to provide certain services to you that require us to share information with
    third parties. If you choose to receive communications from us but later wish
    to discontinue receiving communications or our Services, you can opt-out by
    contacting us via email or mail using the contact information provided below.</p>

    <p>Please
    note that opting out of receipt of promotional e-mail communications will only
    affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided
    your information to a third party before you have changed your preferences or
    updated your information, you will have to change your preferences directly
    with that third party. To opt-out of communications from our third party
    business partners, please contact them directly. </p>

    <p><b>Visitors Outside the United States</b></p>

    <p>This
    Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on the Site from
    residents of the United States. The data protection and other laws of the
    United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in
    your country. If you are visiting the Site from outside the United States, you
    acknowledge and agree that your information may be transferred to, stored, and
    processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central
    database is operated. By using our Services, you acknowledge and agree that
    your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties
    with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy. </p>

    <p><b>Privacy Policy Changes</b></p>

    <p>This
    Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in our
    practices and Services. We reserve the right to modify it at any time, so
    please review it frequently. When changes are made to this Privacy Policy, we
    will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy
    Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or
    share personal information that may impact you, we will also prominently post a
    notice of the changes on the Site and/or notify you by sending an e-mail to the
    e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or
    registration (unless we do not have such an e-mail address or you have
    opted-out of such communication). Your continued use of the Site or Services
    after we have posted any Privacy Policy changes indicates your agreement to the
    changes unless you notify us otherwise. </p>
