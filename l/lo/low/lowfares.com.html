    <h2>Information Retention &amp; Security</h2>
    
    <p>We store your information for no less than one year from the time of initial submission, as well as automated personal information we collect about you.

These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as digital encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information. We restrict access to personal information to employees, contractors, and agents who have a "need-to-know" that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services, and who are bound by confidentiality requirements. We want you to feel confident using our Site to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure.
