	<h2 class="highlightFont">Information Collection</h2>
	<p>
	We may collect personal information that can identify you such as your name and e-mail address, as well as other information that does not identify you.  When you provide personal information through our Site, the information may be sent to our servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.
	</p>
	<p>
	<em><u>User Provided Information.</u></em>
	Although we do not solicit your personal information on this Site, we may collect and store any personal information you provide to us in some other manner, such as when you contact us for help.  This includes identifying information (such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number), and any other personal information you choose to provide while using our Site.
	</p>
	<p>
	<em><u>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information Collection Technology.</u></em>
	We use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our Site.  For example, we collect and store non-personally identifying information through cookies, log files, clear gifs (“web beacons”), and third parties to create a profile of our users that details the users’ viewing preferences.
	</p><ul>
	<li><em>Log Files.</em> Technical information from your browser is automatically collected when you visit our Site.  This information includes your IP address, your browser type, operating system, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see "Cookies" below), and the referring website address.</li>
	<li><em>Cookies.</em> A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user’s computer that tracks non-personal information about the user.  When using our Site, we may assign your computer one or more cookies which enable us to improve the quality of our Service and to personalize your experience.  Cookies allow us to automatically collect information about your activity on our Site, such as the web pages you visit, the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions you conduct while using our Site.  The cookies do not store any personally identifiable information about you.  Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to disable cookies.  If you choose to disable cookies, you will still be able to access our Site, but you may not be able to use all of the interactive features we offer.  Additional information on cookies can be found at:  http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm.</li>
	<li><em>Web Beacons.</em> We, or our advertisers, may use standard Internet technology such as web beacons (or “clear gifs”) and other similar technologies, to gather aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about your use of our Site.  We also may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the quality of our Site.</li>
	<li><em>Information collected by third-parties.</em> We and our business partners, such as advertisers, may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with these advertisements and connect to other websites.  This information allows us and our business partners to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness.  Please note that we do not have access to or control over third parties’ cookies used on our Site, and this policy does not govern the use of cookies by these third parties.  Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies.</li>

	Lowfares.com will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13.  If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.  Because we do not collect such information, we have no such information to use or to disclose to third parties.  We have designed our privacy policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).

	</p>
	<p>
	Please note that our Privacy Policy does not cover any third party’s use or handling of your information once it is shared.  Rather, the privacy policies of the various third parties will govern.

These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.
	</p>

	<p>
	We give our users the opportunity to “opt-out” of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our Site at the point where we ask for the information.

Flower Street, Suite 4400, Los Angeles, CA  90071.

	<p>
	Lowfares.com stores your information for no less than one year from the time of initial submission, as well as automated personal information we collect about you.  Lowfares.com takes appropriate security measures to protect our users’ information against unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or destruction.  These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as digital encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information.  We restrict access to personal information to employees, contractors, and agents who have a “need-to-know” that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services, and who are bound by confidentiality requirements.  We want you to feel confident using our Site to transact business.  However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.

If you are visiting our Site from outside the United States, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated.  By using our Services, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.
	</p>

        <h2 class="highlightFont">Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
	<p>
	This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in our practices and Services.  We reserve the right to modify it at any time, so please review it frequently.  When changes are made to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.  If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share personal information that may impact you, we will also prominently post notice of the changes on our Site and/or we may notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an e-mail address or you have opted-out of such communication).  Your continued use of our Site or Services after we have posted any Privacy Policy changes indicates your agreement to the changes unless you notify us otherwise.
