<p>At Lorex Technology, we are committed to protecting your privacy and to developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience. You can travel through most of our site without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use in those situations. This privacy statement explains data collection and use practices of Lorex Technology; it does not apply to other online or offline&nbsp;Lorex Technoogy&nbsp;sites, products or services. Please read the complete Lorex Technology privacy statement. </p>
<p><strong>Collecting your Personal Information</strong><br>We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you.

Personal information collected by&nbsp;Lorex Technology&nbsp;often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested. </p>
<p>For example: If you choose a service or transaction that requires payment, such as making a purchase in the shopping area of the Web site, we will request personal information necessary for billing and/or shipping, such as: name, address, telephone number, and credit card number.</p>
<p>When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we keep this registration information on file with any information you've already given us on previous visits to our Web site. This is considered your personal profile.</p>
<p><strong>Use of your Personal Information</strong><br>We use your personal information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>

<li>To deliver services that you request or purchase. </li>
<li>To help us create and publish content most relevant to you. </li></ul>
<p><br>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. </p>
<p>Lorex Technology&nbsp;may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on&nbsp;Lorex Technology&nbsp;or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of&nbsp;Lorex Technology&nbsp;and its family of Web sites, or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Lorex Technology, its Web sites, or the public. </p>
