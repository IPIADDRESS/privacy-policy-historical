			  <blockquote>
			    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE </span><br>
  <br>
			      Loehmann's, Inc. and loehmanns.com("Loehmann's") will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone.<br>
  <br>
			      Loehmann's may send member information to other companies or people when: <br>
  <br>
			      I) We are required to send the information to companies who work on  behalf of Loehmann's to provide a product or service to the member,  such as mail houses and email delivery companies. (Unless we state  differently, these companies do not have the right to use the  personally identifiable information that we provide to them beyond what  is necessary to assist us.) <br>
  <br>
			      II) We respond to  subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or we find that actions on  our web site violate the Loehmann's terms of service.<br>
  <br>
			      <span style="font-weight: bold">LOEHMANN'S TERMS OF SERVICE</span><br>
  <br>
			      The general public may use the information provided by Loehmann's on  this site for their own personal uses only. No one may reference or  copy any information for any commercial or public use without our prior  approval in writing. Inquiries of this nature may be sent to  insider@loehmanns.com<br>
  <br>
			      The 'Email-A-Friend' service,  which is accessible via "This week at Loehmann's," is intended for  telling friends and family what we have to offer for that given week.  It is not a tool for malicious acts, uninvited communications, or  deliberate misuse. The email addresses entered in the 'Email-A-Friend'  tool will not be retained by any system outside of auditing or used by  Loehmann's to solicit existing or potential customers at any point  after use.<br>
  <br>
			      <span style="font-weight: bold">COOKIES</span><br>
  <br>
			      Cookies may be  set and accessed on your computer. Cookies allow us to maintain  membership information with our Insider Club members. These cookies  will be used mainly for your ease of using our site. By using cookies,  you will not be forced to log-on each and every time you access our  Insider Club areas. Only members of the Insider Club or Email Advantage  members, who have successfully registered with loehmanns.com, will be  introduced to our cookies. Your PC must accept cookies for proper  Insider Club usage.<br>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold"><br>
			      YOUR ABILITY TO EDIT AND DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION </span><br>
  <br>
			      Loehmann's gives Insider Club members the ability to edit their account  information and preferences at any time, including whether or not they  wish to receive information from Loehmann's regarding specials and new  products via email.<br>
  <br>
			      You may request to discontinue the  delivery of our email messages by simply following the instructions  printed at the bottom of the email, or by sending an email to  insider@loehmanns.com with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line.  Upon doing so, your email address will be permanently marked as deleted  and you should not receive any additional email messages from  Loehmann's Insider Club. (In some cases, you may still continue to  receive a few email messages as our messages and lists are created in  advance, so please allow for a few mailings as a grace period to  process accordingly.)<br>
  <br>
			      <span style="font-weight: bold">SECURITY</span><br>
  <br>
			      Only  you and employees of Loehmann's have knowledge of your Insider Club  card number, and that is the ID to your personal information online. No  one from Loehmann's will ever contact a member asking for his or her  account number or email address.<br>
  <br>
			      <span style="font-weight: bold">CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</span><br>
  <br>
			      Loehmann's may edit this policy from time to time. If we make any  material changes we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement  on our pages.<br>
  <br>
			      <span style="font-weight: bold">QUESTIONS OR SUGGESTIONS</span><br>
  <br>
			      If you have questions or suggestions regarding this policy, send an email to insider@loehmanns.com<br>
