        <span class="style41">Thank you for your interest in our publications and services.   We want you to be aware of the information that we gather and what we do with   it. <br>
        <br>
        We do not install spyware or adware to monitor your activity with   regards to your use of the internet nor do we install “cookies” (text files   which are forwarded to your browser) for our use. It is our belief that your   computer (and your hard-drive) is your own property. <br>
        <br>
        Your information is   used for product delivery purposes (e.g. your name, address and/or email   address) and for payment processing (e.g. your credit card number). From time to   time, we use your delivery information to send you details regarding our other   publications and special offers. Those customers that provide us with their   email address may enjoy free emails with our commentary, advice and/or offers.   These emails offer an opt-out or unsubscribe option. We never share your email   address with other marketers. Sometimes we make your name and address available   to screened companies that want to let you know about products or services as   well. Rest assured, however, that your payment information will never be used   for anything more than for payment processing and never for marketing purposes. <br>
        <br>
        We respect that you may not wish to have your name and address   information shared. If so, you can instruct us to keep such information   confidential and use it only for processing your order and delivering your   subscription or book. Send such requests to us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@lombardipublishing.com?subject=PRIVACY REQUEST">customerservice@lombardipublishing.com</a>.   Include “PRIVACY REQUEST” in the Subject Line and include all relevant   information that would be necessary in having us identify you such as your full   name and address, account number and publication title (a phone number would   help us in case we had additional questions). Anyone wishing to review their   information can contact us in the same way. <br>
        <br>
        We undertake reasonable   efforts to ensure that your information is kept safe from misuse or loss. Our   internal I.T. Department reviews our data network (including passwords,   encryption and back up procedures) regularly to ensure that it is kept free from   harm or unauthorized use. <br>
        <br>
        This Privacy Policy was reviewed and posted on   July 1, 2004 and updated on March 4, 2008. Any further revisions will be updated   to this webpage. Please feel free to check back with this webpage regularly. <br>
