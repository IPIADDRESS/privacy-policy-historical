  <div class="section-hdr-ctr"><h6>February 11, 2013</h6></div>
  <p>
    LOYAL3 offers and supports web &amp; social media sites (“sites”) that allow companies (each a “company”) to connect
    directly to
    customers to enroll in a Social Stock Plan™,
    other financial products, including Social IPOs (an “IPO”). LOYAL3’s platform allows customers to buy stock directly
    through a Plan,
    either purchasing stock that LOYAL3 purchases in the stock market or stock provided directly by the company. Through
    the online
    LOYAL3 platform, you may also effect transactions in certain equity securities of companies traded on a U.S. stock
    market that are
    not part of a Plan or IPO. LOYAL3 makes these stocks available based on its own criteria — such as social
    media prominence
    and other indicia of broad appeal to consumers as selected by LOYAL3 — and the fact that LOYAL3 is making
    these stocks available
    has no relation to the value of such stocks. We are committed to protecting the personal and financial information
    of our customers,
    including persons inquiring about potential services (“customers” or “you”). In the course of providing financial
    products and
    services to you, we need to collect (from you and other sources) and maintain certain nonpublic personal
    information. This privacy
    policy provides information about what nonpublic personal information we collect, what we do with it, and how we
    protect it.

  </p>

  <div>
    <div class="section-hdr-ctr">
      <h6>Privacy Policy</h6>
    </div>
    <p>
      We do not disclose nonpublic personal information about our customers to non-affiliated third parties except as
      specifically described below.
      Please read the following information about how we handle your information.
      <strong>While our privacy policy guides our actions, it also imposes certain requirements on you to protect your
        information,
        as referenced below, by never sharing your LOYAL3 account information or your password.
      </strong>
    </p>
  </div>

  <h6>Who is LOYAL3?</h6>

  <p>This privacy policy covers LOYAL3 Securities, Inc. (Member FINRA/SIPC), which is referred to as “LOYAL3,” "we,"
    "us," and "our" throughout this statement.
  </p>
  <h6>Websites</h6>

  <p> We collect your IP address, browser type, and operating system on each visit to every page on our sites on our
    behalf.
    This information is used <span class="text-underline">only</span> for internal statistic tracking purposes and is
    never shared with other entities outside LOYAL3,
    including affiliates as described below, unless required by law or as otherwise disclosed within this policy. Your
    name and
    other information are not collected unless you specifically provide it.
  </p>

  <h6>Email and other electronic delivery</h6>

  <p>We do communicate using electronic channels, such as email and email notifications about information that our
    customers may access by logging
    into their accounts. LOYAL3 also delivers email on behalf of companies to their investors including investor-related
    information and consumer information.
  </p>

  <h6>What types of nonpublic personal information does LOYAL3 collect?</h6>

  <p>By opening a LOYAL3 account, you provide personal information, including your name, address, email address, date of
    birth, and Social Security number,
    as well as checking account and/or credit/debit card information. We will also obtain information regarding your
    transactions and activities
    in your account. In addition to information provided by you, we may also obtain personal information from the
    companies that make stock offers
    to you using our technology and services (the “Service”), as well as from identity verification services and
    third-party information providers.
  </p>


  <h6>How we share your information</h6>

  <p>We share your information to provide the Service related to your participation in the LOYAL3 platform, to fulfill
    your requests
    for certain offers, rewards, products, and services, and as otherwise described in this privacy policy or required
    or permitted by law.
    We will never sell your personally identifiable information. The companies whose stock you purchase are not
    responsible for the collection
    or security of the information we obtain from you by means of your establishing a LOYAL3 account.
  </p>


  <h6>Information sharing with companies</h6>

  <p> We provide your name, contact information, and demographic data to a company in whose Plan or IPO you have
    enrolled as a customer-owner,
    or name and contact information to companies whose other stock you purchase through LOYAL3, unless you elect not to
    allow that type of sharing.
    That company will use your information in accordance with its own independent privacy policies. You may make this
    decision when you enroll
    and establish your LOYAL3 account, as well as change your choice on “My LOYAL3 Account.” In addition, LOYAL3
    provides analytics for companies
    about their Plan participants. Such analytics are provided by LOYAL3 on an aggregate basis only. If you opt out of
    information-sharing
    with the companies, we will not share your identity with your companies to obtain information from them to perform
    the analytics.
    In any case, LOYAL3 will not provide access to any of your personal information to any of the companies other than
    those in which you are a shareholder.
    We also will not share the following information, including with any of the companies: password, occupation,
    employer, employer’s address,
    checking account information, and Social Security number. Social Stock Plans by certain companies are contingent on
    both LOYAL3 and the company
    knowing the identity of the customer and certain information about the customer. This may be the case with a Plan in
    which a company,
    for example, (a) makes offers involving the granting of shares or a discount for consumer commitments or purchases,
    (b) offers consumer
    discounts based on the purchase of Plan shares, (c) grants shares or discounts to certain customers or other
    persons, or (d) offers shares
    for customer affinity points. In such cases, by enrolling in the offer, you permit the company and LOYAL3 to share
    information required
    to effect the intended transactions.
  </p>

  <h6>Promotional messages delivered by LOYAL3</h6>

  <p>LOYAL3 Securities may deliver promotional messages from the companies you own as well as from LOYAL3. If you choose
    not to receive such
    messages, you may make that choice on any message you receive and you will then receive only messages that are
    required to provide services
    you requested, purely operational communications, or as required or permitted by law. You may not opt out of these
    non-promotional communications.
  </p>

  <h6>Social Media</h6>

  <p>LOYAL3 provides a social media platform to easily facilitate your sharing of your actions or experience through
    your chosen social
    media provider, such as Facebook or Twitter. LOYAL3 is dedicated to providing you choice and control in what you
    share through
    these platforms. You are responsible for understanding the features and your settings on Facebook, Twitter, and
    other social
    media providers. This may necessitate your investigation into the privacy policies and practices of those providers,
    which we
    strongly encourage you to undertake before using those features on LOYAL3.
  </p>

  <h6>Links to other sites</h6>

  <p>Our sites include links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of LOYAL3’s. If you submit
    personal
    information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to
    carefully
    read the privacy statement of any website you visit.
  </p>

  <h6>Chat, email, and telephone</h6>

  <p> We use an online chat feature, email, and telephone to assist you with technical and administrative questions you
    may have.
    We do not provide financial advice of any kind.
  </p>

  <h6>How do we track activity and site usage?</h6>

  <p>When you visit the sites, we may collect technical and navigational information, such as computer browser type, IP
    address,
    pages visited, and average length of time spent on our sites. We may also record the time of actions taken on the
    sites for regulatory or other control purposes.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is accomplished through the use of "cookies." We use cookies to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow you to avoid having to re-enter information and to aid in navigation between pages of our sites.</li>
    <li>Help us recognize you as a unique user when you return to our sites.</li>
    <li>Remember what kinds of information you have shown interest in while on our sites.</li>
    <li>Collect and compile anonymous, aggregated information for statistical and evaluation purposes to help us
      understand how users use our site and to help us improve its structure.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    No personal information is stored in our cookies. You may be able to disable cookies by changing your browser
    settings,
    but our sites’ functionality and your experience may be diminished as a result. For more information about cookies
    and how
    to disable them please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
  </p>

  <p>
    Web beacons are images embedded in a web page or email for the purpose of measuring and analyzing site usage and
    activity.
    LOYAL3, or third-party service providers acting on our behalf, may use web beacons and/or cookies to help us to
    analyze
    site usage and improve the Service. We do not share any personally identifiable information about you with these
    third-party
    service providers, and they do not collect such information on our behalf.
  </p>

  <div class="section-hdr-ctr">
    <h6>Security Practices</h6>
  </div>

  <h6>We are committed to your security.</h6>

  <p>At LOYAL3, we value our relationship with our customers and place the highest importance on respecting and
    protecting your private data.
    We want you to feel comfortable and confident when using our products and services and with entrusting your personal
    and financial
    information with us. With these principles as our guide, we continually enhance our systems and processes as online
    services evolve.
    Because no single solution can ensure online security, we employ a layered security approach with industry-leading
    solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on the LOYAL3 platform, we encrypt the
    transmission of that
    information using secure socket layer technology (“SSL”).
  </p>

  <h6>Your communications with us are secure. </h6>

  <p>Communications between your computer and LOYAL3 are encrypted using SSL technology. SSL enables “client/server”
    applications to
    communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.
  </p>

  <p>
    To support this technology, you need a recent version of an SSL-capable, 128-bit browser, such as Internet Explorer
    7 &amp; 8,
    Firefox, or Safari. These browsers will activate SSL automatically whenever you log onto our sites. To ensure that
    SSL
    encryption is protecting your private communications, look for a small picture of a padlock on the browser frame.
    Another indicator is the URL prefix “https.”
  </p>
  <h6>Ways you can help keep your information secure. </h6>

  <p>When you log onto a LOYAL3 site, you are authenticated by your user name and password. You will be asked for other
    identifying information for any contact with LOYAL3 when you are not logged onto the site, but we will never ask for
    your password.
  </p>

  <p>
    We strongly recommend that you change your password frequently. Your password must follow the password requirements
    required when you enroll or update your password. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your password
    and
    must not provide it to any third party. If you believe that it has been stolen or made known to others, you must
    promptly
    update your password on our site. We are not responsible if someone else accesses your LOYAL3 account through
    information they
    have obtained from you or through your violation of this privacy policy and your account agreement with us.
  </p>

  <h6>How you can access and update your nonpublic personal information</h6>

  <p>You can access or update certain nonpublic personal information that we collect about you by logging into your
    account site using your user name and password. From the home page, click the “Log In” tab at the top of
    any page on LOYAL3.com and select the information you want to change. You can directly correct inaccurate personal
    information.
  </p>

  <h6>Data retention</h6>

  <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is open or as needed to provide you with services (such
    as
    for year-end tax reporting after your account is closed). In addition, we will retain and use your information as
    necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements (including, for
    example,
    maintaining most information for at least six years).
  </p>

  <h6>Changes to the privacy policy.</h6>

  <p>LOYAL3 reserves the right to revise this privacy policy at any time and will notify you of any revised policy.
  </p>
  <h6> Please contact us with any questions. </h6>

  <p>Questions regarding this Privacy Policy and Security should be directed to LOYAL3 by email using the email
    button on LOYAL3.com or when logged into your account or by mail to LOYAL3 Support Services, Box 26027, San
    Francisco, CA 94126.

    <strong>State Laws:</strong> If your address is in Vermont, we will not share information we collect about you
