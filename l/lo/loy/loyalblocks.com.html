<h2>LoyalBlocks – Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
This privacy policy explains how LoyalBlocks uses your data. Capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in the LoyalBlocks User Terms and Conditions, which is available at
<a href="/user-terms-of-service">Terms and Conditions</a>.
</p>
<p>
LoyalBlocks respects your right to privacy. Generally, LoyalBlocks will not make your personal information available to third parties without your consent, subject to this privacy policy. This privacy statement explains LoyalBlocks' policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of Personal Information. The terms of this privacy statement apply unless different terms are specified as part of a special offer or in another contract.
</p>
<p>
Personal Information
</p>
<p>
“Personal Information” is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a customer’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, or information about activities directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases. Personal Information also includes information that you may choose to provide to us, such as your educational, consumer and employment history profile. We collect Personal Information that you provide to us, such as when you register for LoyalBlocks, provide LoyalBlocks with any information or otherwise contact us, when you use any loyalty rewards or plans that LoyalBlocks makes available, or when you take any consumer actions with respect to participating vendors (including making purchases or entering the physical location of such vendor).
</p>
<p>
If you choose to provide Personal Information to us, we will not share this information with third parties or other LoyalBlocks users without your explicit permission, except when required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order or as expressly set forth herein.
</p>
<p>
We may use Personal Information internally – for example, to process your visits and provide you with reliable loyalty plans and rewards and to tell you about specific goods and services we believe will be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive promotional information from us, we make it easy for you to let us know. You can contact us at any time to decline promotional information by emailing us at signout@loyalblocks.com. We may also contact you periodically in order to provide you with service announcements regarding LoyalBlocks, but these messages will not contain promotional information. In addition, we use Personal Information to diagnose problems with our servers, to make LoyalBlocks more useful and to customize LoyalBlocks and personalize its content for you.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The Application may provide LoyalBlocks with information regarding your actual location. LoyalBlocks will collect this information only if you allow the Application to access your location through your mobile device. LoyalBlocks uses this data for anonymous statistical purposes (see below under “Statistical Information”). If you choose to make your visit available to Vendors, LoyalBlocks will also notify the applicable Vendor when you are present in the physical location of such Vendor. LoyalBlocks may provide you with different options for providing such location information to Vendors, and you may change your selection at any time by accessing the Profile tab of the Application.

</p>
<p>
LoyalBlocks does not provide participating vendors with your phone number or email address, or any other means of contacting you directly except through the LoyalBlocks system.If you have registered using a third party service – LoyalBlocks will keep follow the privacy policy of the third party service. LoyalBlocks 'business, however, is to provide you with loyalty plans and rewards that enhance your shopping and consumer experience. In order to achieve this goal, LoyalBlocks provides vendors that you specify with some of your Personal Information, including your past shopping and/or visit history and (if you consent) if you are physically located at such vendor’s store location (see above under the heading “Location-Based Services”).
</p>
<p>
Any personal information you provide to a vendor or any other third party is provided directly to this third-party and is subject to that third party’s provider’s privacy policy. Except as described above, LoyalBlocks is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of participating vendors or other third parties. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of vendors or other third parties before providing them with personal information.
</p>
