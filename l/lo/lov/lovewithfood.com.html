<h2>LoveWtihFood Privacy Policy</h2><br>

</p><br>

<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of Nov 1st 2009. This privacy policy describes how LoveWithFood, and it's parent company EdgiLife Media Inc. treat the personally identifiable information that is collected about you when you visit this website, www.lovewithfood.com ("Site") to which this policy is linked. LoveWithFood and EdgiLife Media Inc. are referred to collectively as LoveWithFood.
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason; each version will apply to information collected while it was in place. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
</p><br>

<p>By using our Site you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing" means using cookies on a computer or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States. If you reside outside the U.S. your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the U.S., and processed and stored there under U.S. privacy standards. By visiting our Site and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the US.
If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of your personally identifiable information, please contact us via email at: <b> feedback (at) lovewithfood (dot) com </b>
</p><br>

<h3>What The Privacy Policy Covers</h3><br>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers LoveWithFood's treatment of personal information that LoveWithFood gathers when you visit the Website and when you use our services.
This privacy policy does not apply to information collected about you by anyone except LoveWithFood and only applies to the web sites to which this policy is linked. Any information you provide when you visit web sites other than those covered by this policy or when you purchase any products or services, or enter contests, that may be linked to or advertised on our web site by companies other than LoveWithFood is subject to the privacy policies posted on those sites. Except as may be otherwise specified herein, this policy also does not apply to information you may provide to us offline.
</p><p><br>

</p><h3>Information Collection and Use</h3><br>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a friendly, customized and efficient experience. We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purposes of the Website.
</p><br>

<h3>Information Collected Upon Registration</h3><br>
<p>If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to LoveWithFood. Personally identifiable information that we may collect may include your user name, IP address, full user name, password, email address, city and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in your public profile.
Your user name, bookmarks, recipes, stories and associated content and any postings you make are displayed throughout the Site. Therefore this data is available to the public and will be identifiable to your Username.
</p><br>

<h3>Additional Information</h3><br>
<p>Your user name and your photo, if you decide to upload one, are displayed to people in the LoveWithFood network to enable you to connect with people on LoveWithFood, as specified in your privacy settings. Once a member, you may provide additional information in the profile section, including but not limited to your bio, your location, as well as your personal web site, if you have one. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find new foodie friends and opportunities in the LoveWithFood system.
</p><br>

<h3>Your Information is not for sale</h3><br>
<p>We do not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes. However, if you elect to become a "fan" of a Brand/Celebrity Profile Page, the administrator of the page (known as "Brand Admin") may send you in-system messages containing commercial and promotional messages.
</p><br>

<h3>Aggregate Information</h3><br>
<p>On an aggregate, non-personally identifiable level we may also use this data to analyze site usage, customize the site's content, layout, and services, and for disclosure to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes and to demonstrate to them the value of our own site. However, we do not sell or rent any of your personally identifying data to third parties for marketing purposes.
</p><br>

<h3>Log Data</h3><br>
<p>When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data" ). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and of our Service, and for the Site's technical administration. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of Service.
</p><br>

<h3>Cookies</h3><br>
<p>LoveWithFood (or third party service providers on our behalf) may set and access cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small amount of data (often including a unique identifier), that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. LoveWithFood uses cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our site.
We may use cookies, IP address and browser data to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns on the sites, to deliver editorial content, and to personalize information. Our cookies may contain personally identifiable information and such cookies may be shared with others to the same extent indicated above.
</p><br>

<p>LoveWithFood (or third party service providers on our behalf) may also use cookies to collect aggregate information about web site users on an anonymous basis. We may share aggregate demographic and usage information with our prospective and actual business partners, advertisers and other third parties for any business purpose.
Some of our advertisers may serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. If you don't want cookies, most Web browsers include an option that allows you to not accept them. However, if you set your browser to refuse cookies, some portions of our sites may not function efficiently.
</p><br>

<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3><br>

<h3>Service Providers</h3><br>
<p>We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.
</p><br>

<h3>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h3><br>
<p>LoveWithFood cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of LoveWithFood or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.
</p><br>

<h3>Business Transfers</h3> <br>
<p>LoveWithFood may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personally identifiable information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.
