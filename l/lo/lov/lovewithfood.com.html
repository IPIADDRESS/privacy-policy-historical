  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    LoveWithFood knows that you care about how your personal information is
    used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following
    to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the Website, you are
    accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy is effective as of Oct 1st 2012. This privacy policy
    describes how LoveWithFood, and it's parent company EdgiLife Media Inc. treat
    the personally identifiable information that is collected about you when you
    visit this website, www.lovewithfood.com ("Site") to which this policy is
    linked. LoveWithFood and EdgiLife Media Inc. are referred to collectively as
    LoveWithFood.
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason; each
    version will apply to information collected while it was in place. We will
    notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new
    Privacy Policy on our Site. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy
    regularly for any changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    By using our Site you are consenting to our processing of your information as
    set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing" means
    using cookies on a computer or using or touching information in any way,
    including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining
    and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the
    United States. If you reside outside the U.S. your personally identifiable
    information will be transferred to the U.S., and processed and stored there
    under U.S. privacy standards. By visiting our Site and providing information
    to us, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the US.
    If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of
    your personally identifiable information, please contact us via email at: <b>
    feedback (at) lovewithfood (dot) com </b>
  </p>

  <h2>What The Privacy Policy Covers</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy covers LoveWithFood's treatment of personal information
    that LoveWithFood gathers when you visit the Website and when you use our
    services.
    This privacy policy does not apply to information collected about you by
    anyone except LoveWithFood and only applies to the web sites to which this
    policy is linked. Any information you provide when you visit web sites other
    than those covered by this policy or when you purchase any products or
    services, or enter contests, that may be linked to or advertised on our web
    site by companies other than LoveWithFood is subject to the privacy policies
    posted on those sites. Except as may be otherwise specified herein, this
    policy also does not apply to information you may provide to us offline.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>
    Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a
    friendly, customized and efficient experience. We only collect personal
    information that is relevant to the purposes of the Website.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collected Upon Registration</h2>
  <p>
    If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you
    will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally
    identifiable information to LoveWithFood. Personally identifiable information
    that we may collect may include your user name, IP address, full user name,
    password, email address, city and other information that you decide to provide
    us with, or that you decide to include in your public profile.
    Your user name, bookmarks, recipes, stories and associated content and any
    postings you make are displayed throughout the Site. Therefore this data is
    available to the public and will be identifiable to your Username.
  </p>

  <h2>Additional Information</h2>
  <p>
    Your user name and your photo, if you decide to upload one, are displayed to
    people in the LoveWithFood network to enable you to connect with people on
    LoveWithFood, as specified in your privacy settings. Once a member, you may
    provide additional information in the profile section, including but not
    limited to your bio, your location, as well as your personal web site, if you
    have one. Providing additional information beyond what is required at
    registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself
    and find new foodie friends and opportunities in the LoveWithFood system.
  </p>

  <h2>Aggregate Information</h2>
  <p>
    On an aggregate, non-personally identifiable level we may also use this data
    to analyze site usage, customize the site's content, layout, and services, and
    for disclosure to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and
    promotional purposes and to demonstrate to them the value of our own site.
    However, we do not sell or rent any of your personally identifying data to
    third parties for marketing purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Log Data</h2>
  <p>
    When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that
    your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data" ). This Log Data
    may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain
    from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you
    use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the
    Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different
    every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and of
    our Service, and for the Site's technical administration. We do not
    associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information
    to identify you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of
    Service.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    LoveWithFood (or third party service providers on our behalf) may set and
    access cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small amount of data (often
    including a unique identifier), that is sent to your browser from a web
    site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. LoveWithFood uses
    cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on
    our site.
    We may use cookies, IP address and browser data to control the display of
    ads, to track usage patterns on the sites, to deliver editorial content, and
    to personalize information. Our cookies may contain personally identifiable
    information and such cookies may be shared with others to the same extent
    indicated above.
  </p>
  <p>
    LoveWithFood (or third party service providers on our behalf) may also use
    cookies to collect aggregate information about web site users on an
    anonymous basis. We may share aggregate demographic and usage information
    with our prospective and actual business partners, advertisers and other
    third parties for any business purpose.
    Some of our advertisers may serve you cookies as well. We do not have
    control over cookies placed by advertisers. If you don't want cookies, most
    Web browsers include an option that allows you to not accept them. However,
    if you set your browser to refuse cookies, some portions of our sites may
    not function efficiently.
  </p>

  <h1>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h1>

  <h2>Service Providers</h2>
  <p>
    We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide
    services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance,
    customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing
    campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these
    third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions
    and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual
    obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and
    security of your data.
  </p>

  <h2>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h2>
  <p>
    LoveWithFood cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or
    private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any
    information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private
    parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to
    respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the
    property and rights of LoveWithFood or a third party, the safety of the
    public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally
    actionable activity, or to comply with the law.
  </p>

  <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    LoveWithFood may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its
    assets, including your personally identifiable information, in connection
    with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event
    of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer
    if the new entity's planned processing of your information differs
    materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Advertising Disclosure</h2>
  <p>
    We use a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our
    website and sites upon which we advertise. This technology uses information
    about your visits to this website and the sites upon which we advertise, to
    serve our ads to you. In the course of serving our advertisements to you, a
    unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser.
  </p>

  <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
  <p>
    Our Site contains links to other websites. The fact that we link to a
    website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our
    affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third
    party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other
    files on your computer, collect data or solicit personally identifiable
    information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use
    or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them.
    We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other
    websites you visit.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Policy Towards Children</h2>
  <p>
    The Site is not directed to persons under 13. If a parent or guardian
    becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally
    identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us
    at privacy at lovewithfood dot com. We do not knowingly collect personally
    identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that a
    child under 13 has provided us with personal identifiable Information, we
    will delete such information from our files.
