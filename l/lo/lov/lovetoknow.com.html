                          We use third-party advertising companies to serve our 
                          ads on the Internet. These third-party advertising companies 
                          employ cookie and 1x1 pixel .gif technology to measure 
                          and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. 
                          To do so, these companies may use anonymous information 
                          about your visits to our Web site and other Web sites. 
                          This information can include: date/time of banner ad 
                          shown, the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, the 
                          IP address. This information can also be used for online 
                          preference marketing purposes. <br>

                          <b>Consumer Information<br>
                          </b> During the process of delivering an ad to you, 
                          LoveToKnow does not collect any personally identifiable 
                          information about you—such as name, address, phone number, 
                          or e-mail address. However, LoveToKnow does obtain some 
                          types of nonpersonally identifiable information—such 
                          as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect 
                          to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer 
                          operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for 
                          example). The information collected by LoveToKnow is 
                          used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring 
                          ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers. In some 
                          cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information 
                          in response to a specific ad (the advertiser may ask 
                          you to fill out a survey or provide your zip code). 
                          If this does occur, LoveToKnow may collect this information 
                          on behalf of an advertiser. This information is used 
                          by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition, 
                          LoveToKnow may combine this information with other users’ 
                          information and review it in an aggregate form to understand 
                          the type of people who view a specific type of ad or 
                          visit a particular kind of website.<br>

                          <b>Data Collection </b><br>
                          LoveToKnow—as well as most sites on the Internet—use 
                          “cookies” to enhance your experience on the web. What 
                          are cookies and why do we use them? First, LoveToKnow 
                          cannot use these cookies to identify you personally 
                          in any way. A cookie is a unique number that is provided 
                          to you the first time LoveToKnow—or any site that uses 
                          cookies—serves an ad to you. This unique number, which 
                          is stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps LoveToKnow 
                          target ads to you. This cookie can help LoveToKnow ensure 
                          that we do not serve you the same ad multiple times 
                          and help our advertisers understand what you like and 
                          do not like about their offerings so they can cater 
                          better to your needs the next time you are interested 
                          in their products or services. While we believe cookies 
                          enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number 
                          of times you see the same ad and delivering more relevant 
                          content to you, they are not required for LoveToKnow 
                          to deliver you an ad.<br>
                          <br>
                          If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is 
                          a simple procedure to delete your cookies manually. 
                          Please consult your web browser’s help documentation 
                          for more information.<br>
