			<h3>How we keep your personal information secure</h3>
			<p>LoveEverything.com Limited is committed to protecting your personal information. All information that you provide to us is stored on secure servers. Access to any personalised area of the site is password-protected for your privacy and security. While we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
			<p>What does all this mean? Just as in the real world, you must protect yourself. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information.

			<h3>How long we keep your personal information for</h3>
			<p>We’ll keep your personal information for the periods set out in the section ‘<strong>What information we collect’ </strong>above, and where we were not able to give a specific period, we will keep it only as long as we need it to provide the LoveEverything products and services you’ve signed up to. We may also keep it to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes and enforce our rights. These reasons can vary from one piece of information to the next and depend on the products or services you’re signed up to, so the amount of time we keep your personal information for may vary.</p>
			<p>All data we store is protected with point-in-time restore functionality, which means that we can restore our databases to the state they were in at any point within the previous 35 days; this is to ensure we can access data in the case of potential data loss or corruption. In reality this functionality is rarely used and if it is every effort will be made to delete again any information that had been deleted from the live database since the restore point. This 35 days that we could potentially restore data from is not included in any other reference to how long we retain your data for.</p>
