<div class="Unit Unit12Blocks">
            <p> lovemoney.com takes the issue of privacy very seriously and we are committed to protecting and respecting our users' privacy. This Privacy and Cookie Statement sets out our current data processing practices. If you have any queries or concerns regarding these practices, you should contact us at <img src="/art/email.gif" class="email" alt="email feedback at lovemoney dot com"></p>
            <h2>The information we collect</h2>
            
            <ul class="DefaultList">
                <li><strong>Registration:</strong> When you register with lovemoney.com, we ask for your name, email address and postal code. We usually also capture your IP address at the time you register.</li> 
                <li><strong>Emailing an article:</strong> If you use our recommendation service to email an article you will need to provide us with your friend's email address. lovemoney.com will automatically send this person a one-time email, attaching the recommended article as well as inviting them to visit and register with our site. We will not use these email addresses for any other purpose. </li>
                <li><strong>Comparison centres:</strong> We may also ask for additional information (such as your name, date of birth and financial data)  when you initiate an inquiry about a product or service featured in one of our comparison centres. If you don't want to give us the information requested, you certainly don't have to, but you will not be able to take advantage of such offerings</li>  
                <li><strong>Optional services:</strong> On occasion, we may also ask you for other personal information in connection with surveys, sweepstakes or other promotional offers running on our site but again, your participation in these features are purely voluntary. </li>
                <li><strong>Information we automatically track:</strong> While on our site, we automatically log certain information about how you're using our site. This information may include the URL that you just came from, your IP address and the pages you visit while on our site.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If your browser is set up to accept them, we also use a feature known as a "<a href="/help/cookie.aspx">cookie</a>." Cookies contain bits of information that Web sites transfer to your computer's hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site such as ours. </p>
            <p>lovemoney.com may place a pixel on pages on our site, or those of our advertisers and partners. This enables us to record in our server logs that a specific user id has visited a particular page. This data allows us to analyse and determine our audience's behavioural characteristics, which helps us to optimise our site, advertisement placement, and marketing focus. Only anonymous, non-personally identifiable information is collected, and it cannot, by itself or in combination, be tracked to a specific individual. </p>
            <p>Nothing in this Disclaimer excludes or limits lovemoney.comâ€™s liability for death or personal injury caused by its proven negligence, or excludes or limits our duties or any liability under any applicable law. </p>

            <h2>At lovemoney.com, cookies are used the following ways:</h2>

            <ul class="DefaultList">
                <li>To automatically access your previously stored account information and deliver more personalised services.</li> 
                <li>To estimate our audience size and usage patterns.</li> 
                <li>Advertising networks that serve ads onto our site may also use cookies but please note that we neither control nor have access to those cookies. These advertisers' uses of cookies are subject to their own privacy policies and not that of  lovemoney.com.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to refuse cookies or to notify you when you've received one. If you reject cookies, though, you will not be able to use certain features of our sites . For more on managing cookies, we encourage you to read the <a href"http:="" www.allaboutcookies.org="" manage-cookies="" index.html"="" target"_blank"="">Interactive Advertising Bureau UK's</a> discussion on what you can do.</p>

            <h2>Our use of this information</h2>
            <ul class="DefaultList">
                <li><strong>More Customised Service</strong>: lovemoney.com collects personal information to provide you, the user, with the best and most personalised Web experience possible and to provide our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right audience. In short, by knowing a little about you, lovemoney.com can deliver more relevant content and advertisements to you while at our Web site and thus, provide you with a more efficient, customise and seamless experience when using our service. </li>
                <li><strong>Internal research</strong>: Cookies and the other information we automatically track are used to help us better understand how our audience uses our site as well as for internal research on users' demographics and interests. Each browser accessing lovemoney.com is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine usage patterns, and to help in targeting content and ads based on user interests.</li> 
                <li><strong>To confirm your registration and contact you</strong>: Once you've registered, we will send you a confirmation email acknowledging your new account to the address that you supplied us. We may subsequently email you about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may interest you.

            </ul>

            <h2>Information sharing and disclosure</h2>
            <p>lovemoney.com does not give, rent, lend or sell individual information to any third party. Furthermore, we will not disclose any information about individual users, except as described below.</p>
            <ul class="DefaultList">
                <li><strong>Third party service providers:</strong>  Our comparison centres are for the most part powered by third party providers.  In addition, we employ the services of third parties to aid us in certain aspects of our operations (such as the distribution of our email products or conducting a survey for us).  Depending on the services performed, some of these providers may be provided with user information. These contractors would be subject to confidentiality agreements which limit their use and disclosure of all information they obtain through their relationship with lovemoney.com to lovemoney.com-related business only, consistent with this policy. </li>
                <li><strong>lovemoney.com community:</strong> On our site you are publicly identified by your user or screen name. If you choose your full name as your username, you have voluntarily disclosed that information to lovemoney.com community. Similarly, any information you provide in your public profile is for public consumption. The same is true for any personal identifiable information (such as an email address) you include in any online comments. Also, if you choose to email one of our articles to someone your email address will be revealed to whoever opens and reads the email. While you will be able to see the sender's email address, the sender will not be able to see yours. However, should you respond to the message, you will have disclosed your email address to the message's recipient(s). </li>
                <li><strong>Current or prospective advertisers/partners:</strong> We only provide aggregate, non-identifiable information to our current and prospective advertisers and business partners. For example, we might tell advertisers that  we have 120,000 Registered  members in Metropolis, but we won't tell them that Superman is one of them, and we won't tell them that his email address is ckent@dailyplanet.com.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal requests:</strong> lovemoney.com may disclose your personally identifiable information to protect the rights and property of lovemoney.com as well as to comply with any applicable law or valid legal process. This includes, but is not limited to: 
                    <ul class="DefaultList">
                        <li>Requests by government agencies. We will disclose any information we have in our possession to law enforcement or government officials in response to any inquiry or investigation or if in our sole discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate in connection with any investigation or activity that is or may be illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.</li>
                        <li>Disclosures we are legally required or entitled to make under any enactment, rule of law or by the order of a court.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
             </ul>
