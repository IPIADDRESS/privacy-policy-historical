		<h2 class="heading large-heading">loveholidays.com takes your privacy seriously</h2>
		<p>
			Loveholidays.com understands and respects the importance of your privacy and we are committed to safeguarding
			your personal information.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any personal information you provide to us including and similar to your name, address, telephone number and email
			address will not be released, sold, or rented to any entities or individuals outside of Loveholidays.com except
			where required by us to process your booking and to ensure that your travel arrangements run smoothly and meet
			your requirements. Our representatives may sometimes follow up, either by e-mail, phone, fax or mail, to people who
			have registered their details and we may periodically send promotional e-mail about new products, special offers or
			other information which we think you may find interesting using the e-mail address which you have provided.
		</p>
		<p>
			We take full responsibility for ensuring that proper security measures are in place to protect your information. We
			must pass the information on to the relevant suppliers of your travel arrangements such as your tour operator,
			airlines, hotels, transport companies etc. The information may also be provided to security or credit checking
			companies, public authorities such as customs/immigration if required by them, or as required by law. We may need
			to disclose our customer list including any personal information relating to you to a third party who acquires or
			attempts to acquire all or substantially all of the asset/ stock in our company or our website.
		</p>
		<p>
			Where your holiday is outside the European Economic Area (EEA), controls on data protection in your destination
			may not be as strong as the legal requirements in this country. We will not however, pass any information onto any
			person not responsible for part of your travel arrangements. This applies to any sensitive information that you give to
			us such as details of any disabilities, or dietary/religious requirements. (If we cannot pass this information to the
			relevant suppliers, whether in the EEA or not, we cannot provide your booking. In making this booking, you consent
			to this information being passed on to the relevant persons.)</p>
		<p>
			Usually your tour operator or other principal will pass this information onto their suppliers once we have provided it to
			them. The tour operator or other principal's use of your information is subject to their policy, both in respect of your
			booking and any future marketing, and is their responsibility. Please ask either us or them for a copy of this if you
			would like to see it.
		</p>

		<h2 class="heading" id="cards">CREDIT &amp; DEBIT CARD DETAILS</h2>
		<p>
			All credit card information and personal information is encrypted as it is passed between your browser and our
			website. When you make a booking your initial payment is cleared using the information you provide. Your credit
			card number is not held in our database. All encryption is performed using at least 128 bits making it virtually
			impossible to decrypt without the necessary decryption key.
		</p>

		<h2 class="heading" id="monitoring">MONITORING</h2>
		<p>
			To ensure that we carry out your instructions accurately, to help improve our service and in the interest of security,
			we may monitor and/or record: (1) your telephone calls; (2) customer activities using CCTV recording equipment in
			and around our premises; and (3) customer transactions and activities on our website. All recordings are and shall
			remain our sole property.
		</p>

		<h2 class="heading" id="other-websites">OTHER WEBSITES</h2>
		<p>
			Our website may contain links to enable you to visit other websites of interest easily. However, once you have used
			these links to leave our site you should note that we do not have any control over that other web site. Therefore, we
			cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites
			and such sites are not governed by this Privacy Statement. You should exercise caution and look at the Privacy
			Statement applicable to the website in question.
		</p>

		<h2 class="heading" id="can-i-do">WHAT CAN I DO?</h2>
		<p>
			You are entitled to a copy of your information held by us. If you would like to see this please ask us. [We may make a
			small charge for providing this to you].
		</p>
		<p>
			If you do not agree to our use of the information as set out above, you should inform us as soon as possible by
			writing to us at Loveholidays.com, The Triangle, 4th Floor South Side, 5-17 Hammersmith Grove, London, W6 0LG
			or by email at [insert e-mail address].
		</p>
		<p>
			In accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998, you may ask us in writing for a copy of the information we hold
			about you (for which we may charge an administration fee) and to correct any inaccuracies in your information. We
			aim to respond to you within 21 days from the date of request.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also choose not to provide us with some of the information we request, however as a result we may not be
			able to complete your booking.
		</p>

		<h2 class="heading" id="cookies">OPT-OUT POLICY</h2>
		<p>
			Subscribers can opt out of receiving further information from us at any time. You will also be given a fast and easy
			option of opting out on all communications. Email us at [insert e-mail address] to unsubscribe.

		<p>
			Please note that in order for us to provide you with optimum service, we use ‘Cookies’ on our website.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>What are cookies?</b><br><br>
			A "cookie" is a small data text file that is placed in your browser and allows loveholidays.com to recognise you each
			time you visit this site (customisation etc). Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information, and
			loveholidays.com does not use cookies to collect personal information. Cookies may also be used to pass
			information between websites owned by loveholidays.com. Cookies will typically contain the name of the domain
			from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique
			number.
		</p>
		<p>
			Two types of cookies are used on this web site - session cookies, which are temporary cookies that remain in the
			cookie file of your browser until you leave the site, and persistent cookies, which remain in the cookie file of your
			browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).
		</p>
		<p>
			Cookies allow us to obtain information regarding users of our site which essentially helps us to provide you with a
			better user experience and tailor our services to your individual needs. We may collect information such as your IP
			address, online activity, web browser details and online activity. We will not however collect or store any of your
			passwords or other highly sensitive data.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>
				By using our website with your browser settings adjusted to accept all cookies, we will take this to mean
				that you want to use our products and services, and that you consent to our use of cookies and other
				technologies as described in this Policy.
			</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Browser settings:</b>
			Most browsers have options that allow the visitor to control whether the browser will accept
			cookies, reject cookies, or notify the visitor each time a cookie is sent. You may elect to reject cookies by adjusting
			your browser's settings, but doing so will limit the range of features available to the visitor on our site and most other
			major websites that use cookies.
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			We use the following types of cookies on our website:<br>
			</p><h3>Category 1: strictly necessary cookies </h3>
			These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as
			accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies services you have asked for, like shopping baskets or
			e-billing, cannot be provided.
		<p></p>
		<p>
			</p><h3>Category 2: performance cookies </h3>
			These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most
			often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor.
			All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a
			website works.
		<p></p>
		<p>
			</p><h3>Category 3: Functionality Cookies </h3>
			These cookies are used to recognise you when you return to our website. This enables us to personalise our content
			for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
		<p></p>
		<p>
			</p><h3>Category 4: Targeting or Advertising Cookies </h3>
			These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the
			number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign.
			They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited a website
			and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising
			cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.

		loveholidays.com acts an agent in respect of all bookings made on our website. For all bookings, your contract will be with the applicable supplier principal of your chosen arrangements, and loveholidays.com acts only as an agent on their behalf. We do not create or organise package holidays. All package holidays available on our website are organised by third party supplier principals on whose behalf we act as agent, and where flights are included, protected under their ATOL. Where you book a Flight plus Hotel product on our website, it is protected under our ATOL (10989) but we still act as an agent on behalf of the applicable supplier principal. All the arrangements on our website have their own price independent of any other arrangements booked at the same time and creates a separate contract directly between you and the supplier principal of each arrangement.

If you do receive an ATOL Certificate but all the parts of your trip are not listed on it, those parts will not be ATOL protected.
