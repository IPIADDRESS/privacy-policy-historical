<h3>1. Types of Information Collected.</h3>
<p><a name="s1a"></a>Personal Data: Personally Identifiable Information (“Personal Data”) is any information that can be used to identify a specific individual, such as your name, email address, home address, phone number, <em>demographic information (such as zip code, age), location information, or payment information (such as account or</em> credit card information). This Website collects Personal Data when you interact with this Website, for example when you subscribe for newsletters; register for membership services such as chat services or message boards; participate in chat services, blogs, messaging services, bulletin boards, message boards or other user forums; respond to polls or surveys; purchase products or services via this Website; register for sweepstakes, contests and other promotional opportunities; or seek help from our customer service departments. We also may collect information when you purchase products or services offline, or register for wireless services via your cellphone or other wireless devices (collectively, “Other Services”). Because providing detailed information regarding our Privacy Policy when you register or provide information in connection with these Other Services often proves impractical, you may instead be provided with a short notice that reminds you to refer to this Privacy Policy and other relevant information from us. We may also obtain Personal Data from reputable third parties, such as credit agencies.</p>
<p><a name="s1b"></a><strong>Aggregate and Anonymous Data:</strong> Aggregate and anonymous data is information that does not identify you specifically, including data collected automatically through the operation of this Website (“AA Data”). We may collect Website usage data (such as which Website pages you visit and in what sequence) through the use of various technologies. For example, we collect IP addresses from individuals who visit this Website. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that “serve up” Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from a website, its servers log your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to any Personal Data, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to this Website and us. We may also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and connection information such as browser type or version. During some visits, we may use software tools, such as JavaScript, to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages, page interaction information, and methods used to browse away from the page.<br>
<a name="s2"></a></p>
<h3>2. Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies.</h3>
<p><a name="s2a"></a>Like many websites, we use “cookies” or other similar technologies to collect AA Data. A cookie is a small data file that writes to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes when you visit this Website. Cookies allow this Website to measure traffic activity on this Website and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, allowing you to visit “member only” portions of this Website without re-registering, and tracking the progress and number of entries in activities that require registration or entry, such as sweepstakes. Similarly, if you have asked us to send you information about upcoming products and promotions, using cookies we collect information about which Website pages you have visited and in what order (“Clickstream Data”) that may allow us to narrow or limit the materials provided to you based on your prior online activities or preferences. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent, as described below.</p>
<p>In addition, we may use a service that collects data remotely by using so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags”) embedded in the Website’s content. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1×1), that is ordinarily not visible to Website visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. This information is AA Data.</p>
<p><em>To learn how you may be able to reduce the number of cookies you receive from us, or delete cookies that have already been installed in your browser’s cookie folder, please refer to your browser’s help menu or other instructions related to your browser. If you do disable or opt out of receiving cookies, we will honor your request, however please be aware that some content, functionality, services and features on this Website may not be available or work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your LoveWhatMatters.com account. In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.</em></p>
<p><em>You can also learn more about cookies by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org, which includes additional, useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browsers</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Data:</strong> We will use your Personal Data for the purposes for which it was provided. For example, if you provide Personal Data to register for a newsletter or a text messaging service, to enter a contest or a sweepstake, or to purchase goods or services, we will use it to register you for or provide you with those goods or services.

We also may send information or offers to selected groups of Website users on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give those businesses your name or address. Under certain circumstances (for example, if you win a contest) we may post your Personal Data on this Website. We will notify you of this possibility when you provide the Personal Data and, if possible, when the Personal Data is posted.</p>
<p>Cookies and similar tools may be used to relate your use of this Website and AA Data to Personal Data obtained from you. If any AA Data is linked with Personal Data, the linked AA Data will then be treated as Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>AA Data:</strong> We may also use Personal Data in aggregate form for purposes of research or analysis. In order to better understand and serve the users of this Website and Other Services, LoveWhatMatters.com often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Data we gather. Although this aggregated data may be based in part on Personal Data, it does not identify you personally. LoveWhatMatters.com may share this type of AA Data with a variety of third parties, including its licensors, service providers, other current and prospective business partners, and agents</p>
<p>We may use AA Data collected from this Website for website administration, advertising and promotional purposes, and we may share such information with various unaffiliated entities for such purposes. For example, IP addresses are used for the purposes of system administration and to provide AA Data to advertisers about the volume of use on this Website, and Clickstream Data and demographic AA Data may be shared with our advertisers and other business partners. We may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess technology that allows this Website to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on this Website. This data (including Clickstream Data about your activities on our Website) may be shared with these companies for this purpose.<br>
<a name="s4"></a></p>
