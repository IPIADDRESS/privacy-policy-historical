				<p class="bold">
					<span class="underline">PLEASE NOTE</span>: THE SERVICES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS 13 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER (INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE AGE OF 18, THOUGH, MUST OBTAIN THE PERMISSION 
					OF A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN) AND WHO ARE LEGAL RESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES, CANADA OR THE UNITED KINGDOM (IF APPLICABLE).  IF YOU DO NOT QUALIFY UNDER

				<p>
					Welcome to LoveFreeGames ("Company," "we" or "us") website and service available through this website (collectively, the "Website" or "Service"). 
				</p>
				<p>
					This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") covers the treatment of personally identifiable information that the Company collects when you are on the Website 
					and/or when you sign up for and/or use the Service. It is important that our users are fully informed about the use of their personal information. The Company 
					believes in 100% permission-based marketing. This Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from the Company and 
					the Company 's joint marketing advertisers ("Advertisers"), whether at the Website, via e-mail and/or on third party websites (via co-registration or otherwise).

					Collection of Information by the Company
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="bold underline section">Children's Privacy</span><br>
					This Website is not directed to children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information on this Website from children under the age of 13. 
					If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a visitor under the age of 13, we will delete the information from our records.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="bold underline section">Personally Identifiable Information</span><br>
					For each user, our web server automatically recognizes the user's domain name and IP address, but not the e-mail address (unless supplied independently by a user).
					<br><br>
					To qualify to receive access to the Website and/or Service, subject to the requirements set forth in our EULA and Website Terms and Conditions, we gather personal 
					information from you in order to establish your Company membership account, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, postal mailing address, 
					mobile telephone number and other demographic information.  We may also collect credit/debit card information for payment and/or age verification purposes.  
					<span class="bold">IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU SUPPLY TO US WITH VALID, COMPLETE, CURRENT AND ACCURATE PERSONAL INFORMATION; SUCH INFORMATION WILL BE USED 
						TO SUPPLY THE SERVICE TO YOU AND TO COLLECT PAYMENT FOR SUCH SERVICE (WHERE APPLICABLE).</span> 
					By submitting your information you authorize us to confirm the accuracy of the information you submitted against government-issued identification.  We may also 
					collect information related to your online activities to more accurately target and measure our advertising inventory, including, without limitation, the places 
					you visit at the Website, content accessed and associated marketing metrics (such as e-mails opened and responded to) (collectively, your “Marketing Profile”).
					<br><br>
					In addition, if you choose to participate in any offer available at or through the Website, whether offered by us and/or a third party, any personal information 
					submitted by you shall be subject to the privacy policy(s) of the respective third party collecting such personal information.  In addition, you may find links 
					to other websites from our Website.  Please be aware that the Company is not responsible for the privacy practices of any third parties and/or websites. We strongly 
					encourage you to be aware of when you leave our Website and/or supply your personal information to a third party, and to read the privacy policies of each and every 
					third party and/or website before using such third party website and/or before supplying any  personally identifiable information to them. This Privacy Policy applies 
					solely to information collected by this Website.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="bold underline section">Use of Information Obtained by the Company</span><br>
					You understand and agree that the Company may use and share your personal information with third parties as needed to supply the Service to you. For example, 
					if you want to use a ringtone that you created on your mobile device, we will transfer your mobile telephone number and the location of the ringtone to a service 
					provider, who will then transmit the ringtone to your mobile device for your personal use.
				</p>
				<p>
					You understand and agree our advertising relationships allow us to make the Company  available to you.  Accordingly, the information that you submit to the Company 
					remains your property, but by participating in the Company Service, you grant us the right to use such information and your Marketing Profile for multiple marketing 
					purposes, including, but not limited to, sharing such information with third parties.  The Company may use such information to (i) directly market certain offers to 
					you  via e-mail marketing, telemarketing, direct mail, mobile telephone text messaging (including, without limitation, SMS and/or MMS) and other methods, 
					(ii) to monitor compliance with our Website Terms and Conditions, and (iii) for content improvement and feedback purposes.  We may sell the personal information that 
					you supply to us and we may join together with other third party businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to you. These businesses may include, but are not 
					limited to, providers of online, e-mail, telemarketing and direct mail marketing services and applications.  Such services and applications may include, but not be 
					limited to, lookup and reference, data enhancement, overlay, appending, suppression and validation. 
				</p>
				<p>
					By registering for LoveFreeGames, you are indicating that you have read and agree to this Privacy Policy and of its all terms and conditions, and you further acknowledge 
					and agree that you understand how and under what circumstances  the personal information you provide will be used. You also agree to receive marketing promotions and 
					other solicitations from this website, its advertising partners and/or other third party advertisers (collectively, “Website Sponsors”) based on the information you 
					provide on this website, and expressly agree to be contacted by any such Website Sponsors through direct mail, phone, pre-recorded message, SMS text and/or email. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to marketing purposes, the Company reserves the right to release your information if: (a) we believe that the Website and/or Service is being or has 
					been used in violation of the Terms and Conditions or to commit unlawful acts; (b)  your information is subpoenaed or requested by a court, governmental agency or 
					law enforcement entity; or (c) the Company is sold, transferred and/or acquired.  Moreover, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any information, record or 
					communication from you to any third party when the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the disclosure is appropriate or necessary, for example,  
					to share your e-mail address with other third parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, you agree that by registering for a Company membership, such act constitutes a purchase, inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended 
					Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR §310 et seq. ("Rule").  Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call 
					List, the Company retains the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule. Moreover, by registering with, or requesting information from, 
					a third-party advertiser at or through the Website, such action shall constitute an inquiry and/or application with the respective third-party advertiser for 
					purposes of the Rule.  As such, you may be contacted via e-mail, direct mail and/or telemarketing by such third-party advertiser in accordance with the Rule.  
					To the extent that your credit card-specific information and/or social security number is collected by the Company, said information will be transmitted securely, 
					kept in confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other than third party service providers – such as payment processors – who provide services to 
					the Company and/or consumer credit agencies) without your prior informed  consent. In addition, by submitting your credit card information to us, you authorize 
					the Company to periodically verify by various methods that your credit card account continues to be  valid and active, including, without limitation, charging and 
					thereafter immediately crediting a small sum to the credit card.  Apart from the foregoing uses, the Company and its affiliates and/or subsidiaries reserve the right 
					to share with third parties the fact that we/they have credit card information on file for you, but such specific credit card information shall not be shared by 
					us/them with any third parties without your prior authorization. 
				</p>
				<p>
					You may receive an e-mail confirming your membership with the Company, co-registration with Advertisers, as well as promotional marketing of commercial products 
					and services. The Company reserves the right to collect and retain data relating to e-mail marketing sent to, and opened by, individuals on our marketing list(s).
				</p>

					You may exercise your option to not receive any future communications from us by clicking here or sending an email to <a href="mailto:optout@LoveFreeGames.com">optout@LoveFreeGames.com</a>. Subscribers should note 
					that unsubscribing from this Website's electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe you from any communications you have elected to receive from our 
					Clients  or other third parties. Please note that you may still receive information from third parties to whom we have disclosed your information prior to the 
					time you opted-out. The Company users who no longer wish to receive promotional e-mail materials from our Advertisers  may opt-out of receiving these communications 
					by following the instructions contained in the applicable e-mail, in accordance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.  You must unsubscribe separately from each Advertiser's 
					list. To unsubscribe from any Advertiser's website or e-mail list, please visit their website or review their e-mail for complete unsubscribe details. Similarly, 
					if, after unsubscribing from Company emails, you click on or access an Advertiser's offer appearing at the Website, you may begin receiving offers by, or on behalf of, 
					those particular Advertisers. You must unsubscribe from their list in order to stop receiving their email offers.

					<span class="bold underline section">Use of Cookies</span><br>
					A cookie is a text file stored on a user's hard drive containing information about the respective user. Cookies can provide great convenience for users at many 
					websites and is required to use the Company Website and Service. For instance, by associating a cookie with your computer which is identified and processed by our 
					servers, you need not log in more than once at the Website, thereby saving time and convenience while using our servers.  In particular, we may use persistent 
					and/or session cookies at the Website.  Persistent cookies do not automatically expire, but persist to permit the Company to register future visits at the Website 
					with your profile in our servers.  In addition, cookies associated with the Company may be read, aggregated and used with cookies associated with other affiliate 
					Internet properties.

				<p>

					gifs to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Website and/or for advertising tracking purposes.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="bold underline section">Third Party Cookies</span><br>
					The Company delivers to your web browser many of the advertisements you see when you use the Website. However, the Company also allows other companies, called 
					third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within and/or on the Website. Because your web browser must request these advertising banners 
					from the ad networks' servers, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web page from the Website. 
					Please note that if an Advertiser asks the Company to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, 
					men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the Advertiser and/or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience 
					they are trying to reach.  However, the Company only authorizes our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting.  
					To the Company' knowledge, the third-party ad servers do not collect personally identifying information about you.  In addition, the Company uses third-party 
					service provider partners to employ anonymous cookies for accounting and data integrity purposes.If you want to prevent a third-party ad server and/or third-party 
					service provider from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you must visit each ad network's and service provider's website individually and opt-out 
					(if they offer this capability).
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently, we have relationships with the following third party service providers and/or may display the following third party ad server networks (click to visit their 
					website).  In addition, we may at some point engage other third-party ad servers and/or third-party service providers in the future.
