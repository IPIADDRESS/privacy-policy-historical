Note that reviews or posts on forums will be public so you should use care before posting information about yourself online.</li></ul><p></p>

<p><em>Information Collected Automatically</em>
<br>When you visit our Websites, we may automatically collect certain information, namely:</p>

<p></p><ul><li>your usage of the Websites, such as the pages you visit and the products you search for;</li>
<br><li>your transactions with us, for example, the type of product you purchased and the costs of each product;</li>
<br><li>technical information, for example, your IP address, time zone and location, and the type of operating system and web browser you use and related information; and </li>
<br><li>data we or others collect about you from cookies and similar tracking technologies, which is discussed below in the section on “Use of Cookies.”</li></ul><p></p>

<p><em>Information from Other Sources</em>
<br>From time to time, we may acquire additional information about our Users from third parties, such as the Postal Service and third parties that assist us in the provision of products and services requested by you.  This may include third-party analytics providers and advertising networks. </p>

<p>OUR USE OF INFORMATION 
<br>We use the Personal Information that we collect for various purposes.</p>

<p>We use it to generate your orders and fulfill the orders you place. </p>

<p>We use Personal Information to carry out our legitimate interests.  These include:</p>

<p></p><ul><li>maintaining and improving our Websites, including personalizing your online experience and ensuring content is presented in the most effective manner for you;</li>
<br><li>keeping our Websites safe and secure;</li>
<br><li>providing information, products and services that you request and other transactional or administrative updates;</li>
<br><li>administering your account with us and notifying you about changes to our services, the Websites, our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy;</li>

<br><li>to administer our Websites and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, research, testing, statistical and survey responses.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>We use Personal Information to fulfill our legal obligations, like keeping records for compliance purposes.</p>

<p>And, we use Personal Information to provide you, or permit selected third parties to provide you, information about products and services we feel may interest you, but only if you have consented to receiving these communications. </p>

<p>We may also combine the information which you provide to us (such as your registration details) with information which we collect about you (such as information about your orders) and/or receive from other sources, and use this combined information for the purposes set out above.</p>

<p>PAYMENT INFORMATION </p>

<p>Lovepop uses third party payment processors Shopify, Stripe, Amazon Pay and PayPal to process payments made for products and services via the Websites. All online payments will be conducted in accordance with Payment Card Industry (PCI) data security standards. Your billing information (which is only used by these payment processors for fraud protection) is encrypted before being communicated to them. Subject to the below exceptions, your credit card details are communicated directly from your browser to these payment processors - Lovepop never sees your full Permanent Account Number (PAN). </p>

<p><em>Shopify</em>
<br>Shopify, Inc. provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you. Some of your Personal Information is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases and the general Shopify application. Shopify stores your data on a secure server behind a firewall.</p>

<p>If you use a credit card to make a purchase (with the exception of wedding and membership purchases, which are discussed below), then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.</p>

<p>All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. </p>

<p>PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers. </p>

<p>For more insight, you may also want to read Shopify’s <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms">Terms of Service</a> here or <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy">Privacy Statement</a> here.</p>

<p><em>Stripe</em>
<br>We use Stripe, Inc. to process payments for wedding or membership purchases.  For Stripe payments, if on the payment page you have requested that your card details be remembered and the payment was successful, Lovepop stores the card type, a Masked PAN (only the first 6 and last 4 digits) and the card’s expiration date as well as an associated token. This information is stored by us so that you and we can identify your stored card and use it for further payments at Lovepop. This stored information can be deleted via the payment form on the Website should you wish to do so. We also store separately the last 4 digits and card type so that we can identify transactions made by a particular card. </p>

<p><em>Pay Pal, Amazon Pay and Apple Pay</em>
<br>If you choose to pay with PayPal, Amazon Pay or Apple Pay, we only store the tokens required to identify the transaction, issue refunds and identify transactions.</p>
