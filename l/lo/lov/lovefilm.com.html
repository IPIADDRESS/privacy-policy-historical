				<p>The information you supply to us is used in the following ways:</p>
				<p>If you register as a <a href="/tsandcs.php" onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'tsandcs','500','600','yes','center');return false" onkeypress="verifyKey(this,event);" title="[Opens in new window]" target="_blank">LOVEFiLM Member</a>, we will use your personal information:</p>

					<li>to promote and market third party services which may be of interest to you, if you elect to opt-in to receive such marketing.  </li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>If you elect to use <a href="/tsandcs.php" onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'tsandcs','500','600','yes','center');return false" onkeypress="verifyKey(this,event);" title="[Opens in new window]" target="_blank">LOVEFiLM Services</a>, in addition to the above uses we we will use your personal information to: </p>

					<li>keep records of your use of LOVEFiLM Services, for business recording purposes and to tailor services and related communications to meet your requirements; and</li>
					<li>tell you about changes to LOVEFiLM Services.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Your personal information is used by us only.  We will not sell or disclose your personal information to any third party without your permission, except where we are required or permitted by law to do so.  You agree that we may disclose your personal information to relevant authorities, parties and/or applicable intellectual property rights holders (or their representatives) if we have reasonable grounds to believe that you have breached our Terms and Conditions or to anyone to whom we transfer or may transfer our rights and obligations.  </p>

				<ul>
					<li>Send you your DVD selections;</li>
					<li>Recommend additional DVDs that you might want to rent; and</li>
					<li>Improve the usability of our site.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We may provide aggregate statistical information (e.g. number of customers in each post code, most popular DVD titles rented, etc) to suppliers or other partners in order to improve our service and business. Such information will never include data that may identify you personally. </p>
				
				<p><strong>Storage and Security</strong></p>
				<p>LOVEFiLM uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt your details as they are being transmitted to us. This is designed to try and keep your personal information (including your credit and debit cards) private.</p>
				<p>We make every effort to ensure that your personal information is stored securely.  However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Consequently, any information that you send to us over the internet is sent at your own risk.  Similarly, you are responsible for keeping your login password private and secure.  You should contact us immediately if you believe there has been any unauthorised use of your account or if your login and password details have become known to someone else.  </p>
				<p>We let you store your card details with us, so that you can continue your subscription and use of LOVEFiLM Services without needing to re-enter your details on each occasion. We only ever show the last four digits of your card number on our public Internet site and of course, this information is intended 'for your eyes only'.</p>
				<p>Your payment details are held in a secure server in the UK that is not accessible from the Internet. </p>
				<p>We will retain your personal information for a period of time after the cancellation of your membership with LOVEFiLM.  This is required for general business recording, accounting and taxation purposes.  We will hold your information only for as long as we are required to retain that information. </p>
				<p>If you subscribe to LOVEFiLM Services we will continue to provide you with services available to a LOVEFiLM Member unless you inform us otherwise, including by opting out of any related marketing.</p>
				<p><strong>Payment Information</strong></p>
				<p>Your credit and/or debit card details are encrypted on a secure server and are used by us to process the payment for your regular monthly subscription. </p>

You will not be able to use LOVEFiLM Services or certain facilities (such as the 'remember me' function) where cookies are used in order to provide such services or facilities.  </p>
