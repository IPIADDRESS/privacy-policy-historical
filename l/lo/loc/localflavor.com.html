                    Local Flavor Inc. (“LFI”), is committed to respecting your privacy, and we have created this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) to give you a clear understanding of how our Website operates, and how personally identifiable information is handled.
                    We have a clear Privacy Policy: we collect no personally identifiable information through this Website unless you voluntarily supply it. We define personally identifiable information as information that can uniquely identify an individual person.
                    This privacy statement explains under what circumstances we gather personal information, how we use it, your choices in regard to our use of the information and how we protect the information.

                <h2>Type of Information Collected</h2>
                <p>
                    When you visit our Site, we may collect and store information from you that you voluntarily choose to give us or enter on our Site, including personally identifiable information. To register as a Member of Local Flavor we will collect your name, address, date of Birth, Social Security Number and information regarding one or more Visa cards to be used in qualifying transactions at Local Flavor Participating Restaurants and other information.  In these instances, we will obtain your consent. Our primary purposes in collecting and processing your personally identifiable information are to provide you with the services you request or to issue to you a CashWards Reward Card and other offers for you. 
                    <br><br>
                    We are collecting this information to enable us to issue to you a CashWards™ Reward Card when you have accumulated sufficient rewards. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <a id="2"></a>
                <h2>Why Are We Gathering This Information From You?</h2>
                <p>
                    To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law (USA Patriot Act) requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. Your Card will be issued by Palm Desert National Bank. The Card is considered to be like an account at that bank. 
                    What this means for you: When you qualify for a CashWards Card we by law must ask for your name, address, date of birth, Social Security Number and other information that will allow us to identify you.
                    <br><br>
                    We may also ask you to enter your driver's license state and number.                     
                </p>     
                <br>
                <a id="3"></a>
                <h2>Our Use of the Information</h2>
                <p>
                    If you need to provide personal information to access features or services, we will clearly disclose how the information will be used.
                    <br><br>
                    We do not sell, trade, or rent your personally identifiable information to others. However, we may share your personally identifiable information with other LFI affiliates, our agents, contractors or business partners in order that they may perform services for us. For example, your personally identifiable information may be shared (i) with contractors we use to support our business (e.g. fulfillment services, technical support, delivery services, and financial institutions) or (ii) where required by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition, since we may conduct research on user demographics, interests, and behaviors based upon information provided to us during use of our Websites, we may combine your information with information collected from other individuals to produce anonymous, aggregated, and statistical information. Aggregated and statistical data does not include personally identifiable information. We use this information, such as the percentage of male or female visitors, or the percentage of visitors within certain age brackets, to improve the content of our site. We also may share this anonymous aggregated or statistical information with partners or other third parties.
                    <br><br>
                    As our company changes and grows, we might sell or buy companies, subsidiaries, products or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event LFI goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its products or assets, your personal information will likely be transferred.                 
                </p>     
                <br>    
                <a id="4"></a>
                <h2>Notice</h2>
                <p>
                    Where LFI collects personally identifiable information directly from individuals, we inform them about the purpose and use of the collected information, and the choices and means, if any, we offer individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal information. Notice is provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are asked for the information. LFI does not use or disclose the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected.
                </p>     
                <br>  
                <a id="5"></a>
                <h2>Consent</h2>
                <p>
                    LFI believes that consent is one of the most important privacy principles. You have the choice not to submit any personally identifiable information to us (although under such circumstances you may be unable to participate in all aspects of our Website).                             
                </p>     
                <br>   
                <a id="6"></a>
                <h2>Access to Review, Correct, and Delete Information</h2>
                <p>
                    LFI uses personally identifiable information only in ways that are compatible with your consent and the purposes for which it was collected. We take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.
                    <br><br>
                    One such step is granting users access to the personally identifiable information they provided on a Website. You may mail your request for access to us at 4080 McGinnis ferry Road, Suite 1307, Alpharetta, GA  30005.. In some of restricted portions of our Site, you may log in to your account profile or preferences to view and modify the information as appropriate.

                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>
                    We are committed to the security of personally identifiable information and we take reasonable precautions to maintain that protection.
                    <br><br>
                    LFI has implemented SSL technology to protect the transmission of personally identifiable information. This technology encrypts the information prior to transmission over the Internet between your computer and our servers. While LFI has implemented SSL technology for some purposes, we cannot guarantee the privacy of all transmissions (including, e-mail communications) to and from our Websites. We protect personally identifiable information stored on the Website servers from unauthorized access using reasonable technical and procedural controls.
                    <br><br>
                    Although LFI uses physical and administrative procedures to attempt to safeguard personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee that it is completely secure from people who might attempt to evade security measures or intercept transmissions over the Internet.
                </p>     
                <br> 
                <a id="8"></a>
                <h2>Retention of Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you have provided personally identifiable information to LFI, we store and maintain the information you have volunteered for so long as we need it to provide the service that you requested, unless you have directed us otherwise, or for so long as we are required by law. 
                </p>     
                <br> 
                <a id="9"></a>
                <h2>Cookies</h2>
                <p>
                    Cookies are tokens of information that our Websites may provide to your browser, which is used only by our Websites while you are at those sites. The LFI Site supplies your web browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to better understand Website usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas).
                    <br><br>
                    LFI will only be able to read those cookies that we place; we cannot access or read other parties’ cookies. We may also use cookies on an aggregate basis to track site navigation and traffic trends. This aggregated and anonymous information will help us to improve Site content, and may be shared with partners or other third parties.
                    <br><br>
                    If you are a registered user on the LFI Website, when you login, we may supply you with a cookie that is maintained by your browser and contains your identifier. This type of cookie is used to identify you and provide you with access to areas of our Website that are limited to registered users, such as those that allow you to view and manage your account.
                    <br><br>
                    If you simply want to browse, you do not have to accept cookies from our site. Should you decide, however, that you would like to register and login to special areas of the Website and you have modified your browser settings not to accept the cookies, you will need to re-set your browser to accept cookies that we send it. Otherwise, we will not be able to let you participate in certain areas of the Website. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies. To learn more about cookies and how to specify your cookie preferences, please search for “cookie” in the “Help” portion of your browser.

                <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
                <p>
                    LFI uses Google Analytics to better understand who is using the Service, and how people are using it. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as time of visit, pages visited, the time spent on each page of the website, IP address, and type of operating system used. We use this information to improve the Service and make it appealing to as many users as possible. Google has developed a <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">browser plugin</a> to allow you to opt-out of Google Analytics' tracking software.

                <h2>IP Addresses</h2>
                <p>
                    An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) whenever you connect to the Internet. Like other Internet sites, LFI may collect IP addresses to analyze aggregate information about the number of visitors and site usage. Your IP address is not linked with personal information that you provide. LFI does reserve the right, however, to use IP addresses to identify individuals who threaten our site, service, or customers in accordance with regulatory requirements.
