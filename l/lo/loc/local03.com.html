				Privacy Policy&nbsp;</h1>
			LocalWorldNumber, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”) realizes how important it is to you 
			to understand what happens to your Personal Information when you use our 
			service. We are committed to protecting the privacy of data that you, the user 
			("you"), submit to this website or to websites under our operation and control 
			(“Website”). To demonstrate this commitment, we have adopted this privacy 
			policy ("Privacy Policy"). Our policy is based on the principles of 
			notice/awareness, choice/consent, access/participation, and integrity/security 
			in the collection and use of all information regarding our users and their 
			activities at the Website. Please review this policy carefully each time you 
			use the Website, as it is subject to change at any time with or without notice 
			by us. Whether or not we place notice on the Website indicating that this 
			Privacy Policy has been modified, it is your obligation to review the Privacy 
			Policy from time to time. By accessing the Website, you are affirmatively 
			indicating your agreement and consent to this Privacy Policy. Any changes to 
			the Privacy Policy will be effective immediately upon posting to the Website.
			<br>
			<p></p>
			<h2>Notice of Privacy Policy</h2>
			<br>
			LocalWorldNumber, Inc, and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively “we”, 
			“our”, “us”), provides our customers ("you") with a broad range of hosted and 
			Internet-based telecommunications services, software and client-based 
			applications, including access numbers around the world, long-distance and 
			local telephone services, and Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VOIP) 
			communications, features and functionalities more fully described on<a href="http://www.localworldnumber.com">
			www.LocalWorldNumber.com</a> . As used herein, the term “Service” refers 
			collectively to all our hosted and Internet-based telecommunications services, 
			as well as any documentation related.
			<br>
			<br>
			This Privacy Policy supplements and is incorporated into the LocalWorldNumber 
			”Terms of Use Agreement”,currently available on the Website, and you agree to 
			be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. We reserve 
			the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended 
			version on the Website and such amended Privacy Policy shall become effective 
			immediately upon such posting. By continuing to use the Service, you agree to 
			the terms of the then-current version of this Privacy Policy. If at any time 
			you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, your sole remedy is to 
			discontinue using the Service. If you have any questions about this Privacy 
			Policy, please contact us at the e-mail address specified in the contact 
			details.<p></p>
			<br>
			<br>
			Information that may be collected based on your use of the Service includes 
			Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. "Personal Information" is 
			information that would allow someone to identify or contact you, including, for 
			example, your full name, address, telephone number, or email address, as well 
			as information that is associated with or linked to such contact information. 
			"Non-Personal Information" is information that is not associated with or linked 
			to the individually identifying contact information of a specific person 
			including without limitation information about your use of the Service, also 
			referred to as "Usage Data". "Aggregate Data" is the combined information 
			collected from all of the users of the Service, or from subgroups of our users, 
			which does not contain any individually identifying contact information. In 
			other words, Aggregate Data is never connected to you individually.
			<br>
			<br>
			1. What Types of Information Is Collected and Why?<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Personal Information</strong>. You provide certain Personal Information 
			to us when you: (a) register and sign up for the Service, (b) log into your 
			account with the Service, or (c) use the Service, submit forms, or send other 
			information to us.<br>
			We may also receive Personal Information about you from other users, our 
			partners, affiliates, or third parties, who may communicate information to us 
			about you.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Non-Personal Information.</strong> We may collect Non-Personal 
			Information as well. Our software and servers may automatically collect Usage 
			Information, which includes, but is not limited to, your frequency and duration 
			of interaction with the Service.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Information collected by Cookies</strong>. We may also make use of 
			website "cookies" to help you use the Service more easily and to help us 
			continuously improve the Website and the value of the Service to you. A 
			"cookie" is a small data file that a website can send to your browser, which 
			may then be stored on your hard drive to help that website "remember" 
			information about you when you return to that website, such as the specific web 
			pages you previously visited. You may have the option of setting your browser 
			to reject cookies; however, doing so may negatively impact the performance of 
			the Website or restrict us in effectively serving your needs and interests. The 
			"Help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent 
			your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you 
			when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. The 
			Personal Information and Non-Personal Information allows us to efficiently and 
			properly serve you, and to contact you should the need arise in order to 
			respond appropriately to your requests.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Information collected by 3rd parties.</strong> We have contracted with 
			several outside vendors ("3rd parties") to monitor certain pages of our Web 
			site for the purpose of reporting web traffic, statistics, advertisement 
			'click-throughs', and/or other activities on our site. Where authorized by us, 
			3rd parties may use cookies, Web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies 
			to compile anonymous statistics on our Web site visitors. No personally 
			identifiable data is collected by or transferred by us to 3rd parties.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2. How May We Use Your Personal Information?</strong><br>
			<br>
			We may use your Personal and Non-Personal Information to improve the quality of 
			the Service and to boost the relevance of the offering delivered to you. We may 
			use your Personal and Non-Personal Information to provide you with content 
			(such as offers, advertisements, voicemails, and other promotions) that we 
			believe will be of interest to you. We will retain information collected on a 
			secure server so that on re-visiting the Website, your access can be more 
			easily expedited. We may use this information in an aggregated form to measure 
			the number of visits, average time spent on the Website, pages viewed, and 
			other related statistics. We collect this information to measure the use of the 
			Website and to improve the content of the Website. We may use your personally 
			identifying information to identify you as a user of the Website and to assist 
			and speed the completion of transactions through the Website. We may use your 
			email address to contact you directly regarding services or products that we, 
			in our sole discretion, believe may be of interest to you. We may also use 
			information collected about your preferences and activities on the Website, 
			such as the particular pages you visit on the Website, your history of 
			purchases, and/or other transactions that you effect through the Website. We 
			may vary the content you receive in future visits to the Website based on your 
			past preferences and activities.<br>
			<br>
			We use Usage Data to maintain and improve the Service. We may also use Usage 
			Data to do such things as operate and enhance the Service and negotiate with 
			vendors and advertisers.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>3. Disclosure of Your Information<br>
			</strong>
			<br>
			By using the Service, you consent to our disclosure of your information to our 
			partners, affiliates, parent and subsidiary(s) (“Partners”). Other than 
			disclosure of your Personal Information to our Partners, we will never disclose 
			any of your Personal Information except when given your permission or under 
			special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law 
			requires it or under the circumstances described below.<br>
			<br>
			Due to legal rules beyond our control, we cannot fully ensure that your private 
			communications and other Personal Information will not be disclosed to other 
			third parties. For example, if we need to investigate or resolve possible 
			problems or inquiries, or if we receive a subpoena requesting information about 
			you or communications by or to you, we can, and you authorize us to (without 
			any opportunity by you to challenge the validity of the request or the 
			subpoena), disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other 
			government officials or the party serving the subpoena as we believe necessary 
			or appropriate.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>5. Privacy Protections for Children</strong><br>
			<br>
			We feel very strongly about protecting the privacy of children and encourages 
			children to involve their parents in any online activities in which they 
			participate. In order to protect the privacy of younger Internet users, 
			children under the age of 18 are prohibited from registering for the Service.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>6. Accuracy and Access</strong><br>
			<br>
			Certain areas of the Website may restrict access to specific individuals 
			through the use of passwords and through providing personal data. We strive to 
			keep your personally identifiable information accurate. We will provide you 
			with access to your information, including online access to your registration 
			data so that you may view, update or correct your information on the Website. 
			To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to 
			verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make 
			corrections. Any links to third-party web sites on the Website are provided 
			solely as a convenience to you. If you use these links, you will leave our 
			Website. We have not reviewed all of these third party sites and do not control 
			and is not responsible for any of these sites, their content, or their privacy 
			policies. Thus, we do not endorse or make any representations about them, or 
			any information, software or other products or materials found there, or any 
			results that may be obtained from using them. If you decide to access any of 
			the third party sites linked to the Website, you do so at your own risk.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>8. Our Security Procedures</strong><br>
			<br>
			Please keep in mind that no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless 
			network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to 
			protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of 
			any information you transmit to us or from the Service, and you do so at your 
			own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we exert commercially reasonable 
			effort to ensure its security on our systems by implementing industry-standard 
			security measures.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>9. General.<br>
			</strong>
			<br>
			This Privacy Policy is governed by the internal substantive laws of the State 
			of California in the United States, without regard to its conflict of laws 
			principles. Jurisdiction for any claims arising under or out of this Privacy 
			Policy shall lie exclusively with the state and federal courts in San Mateo 
			County, California, and you further consent to the exercise of personal 
			jurisdiction of the courts therein. If any provision of this Privacy Policy is 
			found to be invalid by a court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of 
			such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of 
			this Privacy Policy, which shall remain in full force and effect. Under no 
			circumstances shall we have any liability whatsoever for any consequential, 
			incidental, indirect or special damages arising out of the breach of this 
			Privacy Policy, however occasioned. Furthermore, nothing in this Privacy Policy 
			shall increase our liability or otherwise alter or amend any of the terms and 
			conditions under the LocalWorldNumber® Terms of Use and End-User License 
			Agreement<br>
