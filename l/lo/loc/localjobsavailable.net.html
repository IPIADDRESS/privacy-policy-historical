The purpose of this privacy policy is to  inform you, as a visitor to LocalJobsAvailable.net, what kinds of information we may  gather about you when you visit <u>http://www.localjobsavailable.net</u> ("Web Site"), how we may use that information, and whether we  disclose it to anyone.  This privacy policy applies only to  information collected from you online, not offline.  This privacy  policy applies only to LocalJobsAvailable.net, its subsidiaries and affiliates, the Web  Site, and other web sites owned by LocalJobsAvailable.net, but not to other companies'  or organizations' web sites to which we link. </p>
                <p> If LocalJobsAvailable.net decides to change any of its  privacy policies, the changes will be posted here in this area so  that you will always know the information we gather, how we might use  that information and to whom we will disclose it.  We reserve the  right, at our discretion to change, modify, add or remove portions of  this policy at any time.  Please make sure to check this page  periodically for any changes.  If you do not agree with the terms of  this privacy policy, please do not visit the Web Site. </p>
