					<h3>Our Commitment To Privacy</h3>
					<p>
						LocoWise Pte Ltd wants you to understand how we use, protect and share information gathered while using our website and/or
						applications we offer. We’re here to use data gathered for good, not evil. If you want to make sure we’re not doing
						something you don’t want us to do, email us at privacy@locowise.com.<br><br>

						As of April 21, 2000 the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act became effective. The regulations apply to the
						online collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. LocoWise Pte Ltd is very sensitive to the
						issue of children’s privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. If you
						are under 13 years of age you should not use this website, and under no circumstances should you send information
						about yourself to LocoWise Pte Ltd, this Web site, products, and services are not developed for or directed at children.
						Our policy is not to permit anyone under the age of 18 to do business with us. If LocoWise Pte Ltd discovers that a child
						under the age of 13 has provided LocoWise Pte Ltd with personally identifiable information, LocoWise Pte Ltd will immediately
						delete that child’s personally identifiable information from the website.
					</p><br>

					<h3>What Types of Information Does LocoWise Pte Ltd Collect And How Will It Be Used?</h3>
					<p>
						LocoWise Pte Ltd only collects information from you on a voluntary basis. We do not send Spam or sell email addresses. So
						that we can provide you with the most efficient and enhanced experience, we request that you register for a personal
						account accessible through a confidential password and screen name that you select. For purposes of registration,
						we collect identifiable information about you such as your name, email address, and demographic information such
						as age, gender and zip code. We also may collect your IP address, browser type, operating system type, domain name,
						access times and referring website address. This information is collecting during registration or in response to
						specific requests from you, for things such as signing up for an email newsletter, chat room, or other online
						information service we may offer, entering a contest, answering a survey, or contacting us. Surveys are conducted
						strictly for internal profiling purposes and only keep track of anonymous demographic data (e.g., your age, usage
						of the LocoWise Pte Ltd website, favorite features).<br><br>

						Our website contains links through which an online user can email us. We collect personal information contained in
						the email for the purpose of responding to a user’s questions and/or comments. From time to time, we may post on
						our website job openings at LocoWise Pte Ltd and provide an email address to which interested applicants can submit their
						resume. Although we can assure you that any personal information contained in a resume will be used solely for its
						intended purpose (i.e., to evaluate the applicant’s qualifications), such information is not subject to this privacy
						policy. No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only
						collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business
						objectives.
					</p><br>

						when data is being collected. For instance, when you come to our website, your IP address is collected so that we
						know where to send information you are requesting. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the
						network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. A "cookie" is a small file or record-keeping
						device that websites often store on a user’s computer. (You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when
						cookies are being sent to your computer.) This information may be used to make our website more interesting and useful
						to you. Additionally, we may combine this information with personally identifiable information to identify a user in
						order to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or to protect our service, website or users of LocoWise Pte Ltd’s website.
					</p><br>

						purposes. If you do not wish to have you company name or mark used by LocoWise Pte Ltd you must opt-out by notifying us in
						writing: please contact us via email at privacy@locowise.com. LocoWise Pte Ltd will take reasonable care in removing your
						name or mark within a reasonable time.<br><br>

						for the internal operations of our website (e.g., technical support and network delivery). These entities will not
						use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality,
						security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us.<br><br>

						information, in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of substantially all assets, or other
						fundamental corporate change. We may disclose your personal information in the good faith belief that we are

					<h3>Third Party Advertisements And Content</h3>
					<p>
						When you are using the LocoWise Pte Ltd website, certain content, including advertisements, may be created or hosted by a
						third party. Such third parties may place cookies and/or use web beacons, which may be used to identify some of
						your preferences or to recognize you if you have previously had contact with them. We do not control the use of

						 LocoWise Pte Ltd makes an effort to protect the personally identifiable information of all users of its website. We attempt
						 to comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws to the extent they may apply to LocoWise Pte Ltd’s services.
						 If you are uncertain whether this privacy policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy laws where you are
						 located, you should not submit your personally identifiable information to LocoWise Pte Ltd. If you are located within
						 the European Union, you should be aware that your personally identifiable information will be transferred to
						 the United States of America, the laws of which may be deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data
						 protection. If you are located in a country outside the United States of America and voluntarily submit
						 personally identifiable information to us, you thereby consent to the general use of such information as
						 provided in this privacy policy and to the transfer of that information to, and/or storage of that information
						 in, the United States of America.

					<h3>Changes In The LocoWise Pte Ltd Privacy Policy</h3>
					<p>
						We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time. If we change our privacy policy, we will
						post those changes on our website so that you and other users are always aware of what information we collect,

						to ensure you are aware of any changes.
					</p><br>

					<h3>Security</h3>
					<p>
						LocoWise Pte Ltd takes appropriate precautions to protect our users’ information. Your account information is located on a
						secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information, we encrypt that information using secure
						socket layer technology (SSL). LocoWise Pte Ltd also has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality
						of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such
						information for the purpose of performing their jobs. The Internet is not a 100% secure medium. Although we use
						reasonable efforts to protect information, the potential of somebody breaching our security measures does exist.
						<br><br>

						By using this website, you signify your assent to the LocoWise Pte Ltd Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this privacy
						policy, please do not use this website or applications. Your continued use of this website or applications will
						signify your acceptance of these changes.<br><br>

						This LocoWise Pte Ltd Privacy Policy was updated August 1, 2012.
