<p>
LocoWise Pte Ltd wants you to understand how we use, protect and share information gathered while using our website and/or
applications we offer. We’re here to use data gathered for good, not evil. If you want to make sure we’re not doing
something you don’t want us to do, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@locowise.com">privacy@locowise.com</a>.<br><br>
As of April 21, 2000 the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act became effective. The regulations apply to the
online collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. LocoWise Pte Ltd is very sensitive to the
issue of children’s privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. If you
are under 13 years of age you should not use this website, and under no circumstances should you send information
about yourself to LocoWise Pte Ltd, this Web site, products, and services are not developed for or directed at children.
Our policy is not to permit anyone under the age of 18 to do business with us. If LocoWise Pte Ltd discovers that a child
under the age of 13 has provided LocoWise Pte Ltd with personally identifiable information, LocoWise Pte Ltd will immediately
delete that child’s personally identifiable information from the website.
</p>
<h3>What Types of Information Does LocoWise Pte Ltd Collect And How Will It Be Used?</h3>
<p>
LocoWise Pte Ltd only collects information from you on a voluntary basis. We do not send Spam or sell email addresses. So
that we can provide you with the most efficient and enhanced experience, we request that you register for a personal
account accessible through a confidential password and screen name that you select. For purposes of registration,
we collect identifiable information about you such as your name, email address, and demographic information such
as age, gender and zip code. We also may collect your IP address, browser type, operating system type, domain name,
access times and referring website address. This information is collecting during registration or in response to
specific requests from you, for things such as signing up for an email newsletter, chat room, or other online
information service we may offer, entering a contest, answering a survey, or contacting us. Surveys are conducted
strictly for internal profiling purposes and only keep track of anonymous demographic data (e.g., your age, usage
of the LocoWise Pte Ltd website, favorite features).<br><br>
Our website contains links through which an online user can email us. We collect personal information contained in
the email for the purpose of responding to a user’s questions and/or comments. From time to time, we may post on
our website job openings at LocoWise Pte Ltd and provide an email address to which interested applicants can submit their
resume. Although we can assure you that any personal information contained in a resume will be used solely for its
intended purpose (i.e., to evaluate the applicant’s qualifications), such information is not subject to this privacy
policy. No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only
collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business
objectives.
</p>
<h3>Does LocoWise Pte Ltd Use Cookies Or Other Means To Collect Information?</h3>
<p>
We may collect some information about you by using data collection technology, it may not be readily apparent to you

know where to send information you are requesting. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the

device that websites often store on a user’s computer. (You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when
cookies are being sent to your computer.) This information may be used to make our website more interesting and useful
to you. Additionally, we may combine this information with personally identifiable information to identify a user in
order to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or to protect our service, website or users of LocoWise Pte Ltd’s website.
</p>

<p>

security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us.<br><br>

located, you should not submit your personally identifiable information to LocoWise Pte Ltd. If you are located within
the European Union, you should be aware that your personally identifiable information will be transferred to
the United States of America, the laws of which may be deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data
protection. If you are located in a country outside the United States of America and voluntarily submit

provided in this privacy policy and to the transfer of that information to, and/or storage of that information

to ensure you are aware of any changes.
</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
LocoWise Pte Ltd takes appropriate precautions to protect our users’ information. Your account information is located on a
secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information, we encrypt that information using secure
socket layer technology (SSL). LocoWise Pte Ltd also has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality
of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such
information for the purpose of performing their jobs. The Internet is not a 100% secure medium. Although we use
reasonable efforts to protect information, the potential of somebody breaching our security measures does exist.
</p>
<p>

policy, please do not use this website or applications. Your continued use of this website or applications will
