					<p> LocoWise Pte Ltd wants you to understand how we use, protect and share information gathered while using our website and/or
					applications we offer. We’re here to use data gathered for good, not evil. If you want to make sure we’re not doing
					something you don’t want us to do, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@locowise.com">privacy@locowise.com</a>.<br>
					<br>
					As of April 21, 2000 the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act became effective. The regulations apply to the
					online collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. LocoWise Pte Ltd is very sensitive to the
					issue of children’s privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. If you
					are under 13 years of age you should not use this website, and under no circumstances should you send information
					about yourself to LocoWise Pte Ltd, this Web site, products, and services are not developed for or directed at children.
					Our policy is not to permit anyone under the age of 18 to do business with us. If LocoWise Pte Ltd discovers that a child
					under the age of 13 has provided LocoWise Pte Ltd with personally identifiable information, LocoWise Pte Ltd will immediately
					delete that child’s personally identifiable information from the website. </p>
					<h3>What Types of Information Does LocoWise Pte Ltd Collect And How Will It Be Used?</h3>
					<p> LocoWise Pte Ltd only collects information from you on a voluntary basis. We do not send Spam or sell email addresses. So
					that we can provide you with the most efficient and enhanced experience, we request that you register for a personal
					account accessible through a confidential password and screen name that you select. For purposes of registration,
					we collect identifiable information about you such as your name, email address, and demographic information such
					as age, gender and zip code. We also may collect your IP address, browser type, operating system type, domain name,
					access times and referring website address. This information is collecting during registration or in response to
					specific requests from you, for things such as signing up for an email newsletter, chat room, or other online
					information service we may offer, entering a contest, answering a survey, or contacting us. Surveys are conducted
					strictly for internal profiling purposes and only keep track of anonymous demographic data (e.g., your age, usage
					of the LocoWise Pte Ltd website, favorite features).<br>
					<br>
					Our website contains links through which an online user can email us. We collect personal information contained in
					the email for the purpose of responding to a user’s questions and/or comments. From time to time, we may post on
					our website job openings at LocoWise Pte Ltd and provide an email address to which interested applicants can submit their
					resume. Although we can assure you that any personal information contained in a resume will be used solely for its
					intended purpose (i.e., to evaluate the applicant’s qualifications), such information is not subject to this privacy
					policy. No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only
					collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business
					objectives. </p>
					<h3>Does LocoWise Pte Ltd Use Cookies Or Other Means To Collect Information?</h3>
					<p> We may collect some information about you by using data collection technology, it may not be readily apparent to you
					when data is being collected. For instance, when you come to our website, your IP address is collected so that we
					know where to send information you are requesting. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the
					network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. A "cookie" is a small file or record-keeping
					device that websites often store on a user’s computer. (You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when
					cookies are being sent to your computer.) This information may be used to make our website more interesting and useful
					to you. Additionally, we may combine this information with personally identifiable information to identify a user in
					order to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or to protect our service, website or users of LocoWise Pte Ltd’s website. </p>
					<h3>With Whom Does LocoWise Pte Ltd Share My Personally Identifiable Information?</h3>
					<p> LocoWise Pte Ltd reserves the right to use your company name, logo and other identifiable marks for any and all promotional
					purposes. If you do not wish to have you company name or mark used by LocoWise Pte Ltd you must opt-out by notifying us in
					writing: please contact us via email at <a href="mailto:privacy@locowise.com">privacy@locowise.com</a>. LocoWise Pte Ltd will take reasonable care in removing your
					name or mark within a reasonable time.<br>
					<br>
					From time to time, we may employ and share your personal information with vendors who use it solely to provide support
					for the internal operations of our website (e.g., technical support and network delivery). These entities will not
					use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality,
					security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us.<br>
					<br>
					It is our policy not to share, sell or rent your personal information to any company not directly related to LocoWise Pte Ltd.
					LocoWise Pte Ltd reserves the right to share your personally identifiable information with our parent or affiliated companies.

					information, in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of substantially all assets, or other
					fundamental corporate change. We may disclose your personal information in the good faith belief that we are
					required to do so by law or to comply with legal processes, respond to any claims or protect the rights, property,
					or personal safety of LocoWise Pte Ltd staff or the public. </p>
					<h3>Third Party Advertisements And Content</h3>
					<p> When you are using the LocoWise Pte Ltd website, certain content, including advertisements, may be created or hosted by a
					third party. Such third parties may place cookies and/or use web beacons, which may be used to identify some of
					your preferences or to recognize you if you have previously had contact with them. We do not control the use of
					such technology by third parties, the information they collect, or how they use such information. LocoWise Pte Ltd does
					not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties serving ads or other content on our website. </p>
					<h3>What Is LocoWise Pte Ltd's Policy Regarding Links To Third Party Websites?</h3>
					<p> You should be aware that while you are on a website operated by us, you may be directed to links to other websites.
					The privacy policies of these other websites are beyond our control and we take no responsibility for their practices.

					you read the privacy policy of the website to which you link before you submit any personal information. </p>
					<h3>How Can I Access My Personal Information?</h3>
					<p> If you wish to review, update, or delete any personal information that we may have collected about you, please

					<h3>What Are My Privacy Rights If I Am Located Outside The United States of America?</h3>
					<p> LocoWise Pte Ltd makes an effort to protect the personally identifiable information of all users of its website. We attempt
					to comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws to the extent they may apply to LocoWise Pte Ltd’s services.
					If you are uncertain whether this privacy policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy laws where you are
					located, you should not submit your personally identifiable information to LocoWise Pte Ltd. If you are located within
					the European Union, you should be aware that your personally identifiable information will be transferred to
					the United States of America, the laws of which may be deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data
					protection. If you are located in a country outside the United States of America and voluntarily submit
					personally identifiable information to us, you thereby consent to the general use of such information as
					provided in this privacy policy and to the transfer of that information to, and/or storage of that information
					in, the United States of America. </p>
					<h3>Changes In The LocoWise Pte Ltd Privacy Policy</h3>
					<p> We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time. If we change our privacy policy, we will
					post those changes on our website so that you and other users are always aware of what information we collect,
					how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. You should also check back from time to time
					to ensure you are aware of any changes. </p>
					<h3>Security</h3>
					<p> LocoWise Pte Ltd takes appropriate precautions to protect our users’ information. Your account information is located on a
					secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information, we encrypt that information using secure
					socket layer technology (SSL). LocoWise Pte Ltd also has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality
					of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such
					information for the purpose of performing their jobs. The Internet is not a 100% secure medium. Although we use
					reasonable efforts to protect information, the potential of somebody breaching our security measures does exist. </p>
					<p> By using this website, you signify your assent to the LocoWise Pte Ltd Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this privacy
					policy, please do not use this website or applications. Your continued use of this website or applications will
					signify your acceptance of these changes.</p>
