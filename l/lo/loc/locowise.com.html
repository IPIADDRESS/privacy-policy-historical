							PRIVACY POLICY</span> </div>
						<p>Updated As Of 15 September 2014</p>
						<p> LocoWise Pte Ltd wants you to understand how we use, protect and share information gathered while using our website and/or
							applications we offer. We’re here to use data gathered for good, not evil. If you want to make sure we’re not doing
							something you don’t want us to do, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@locowise.com">privacy@locowise.com</a>.<br>
							<br>
							As of April 21, 2000 the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act became effective. The regulations apply to the
							online collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. LocoWise Pte Ltd is very sensitive to the
							issue of children’s privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. If you
							are under 13 years of age you should not use this website, and under no circumstances should you send information
							about yourself to LocoWise Pte Ltd, this Web site, products, and services are not developed for or directed at children.
							Our policy is not to permit anyone under the age of 18 to do business with us. If LocoWise Pte Ltd discovers that a child
							under the age of 13 has provided LocoWise Pte Ltd with personally identifiable information, LocoWise Pte Ltd will immediately
							delete that child’s personally identifiable information from the website. </p>
						<h3>What Types of Information Does LocoWise Pte Ltd Collect And How Will It Be Used?</h3>
						<p> LocoWise Pte Ltd only collects information from you on a voluntary basis. We do not send Spam or sell email addresses. So
							that we can provide you with the most efficient and enhanced experience, we request that you register for a personal
							account accessible through a confidential password and screen name that you select. For purposes of registration,
							we collect identifiable information about you such as your name, email address, and demographic information such
							as age, gender and zip code. We also may collect your IP address, browser type, operating system type, domain name,
							access times and referring website address. This information is collecting during registration or in response to
							specific requests from you, for things such as signing up for an email newsletter, chat room, or other online
							information service we may offer, entering a contest, answering a survey, or contacting us. Surveys are conducted
							strictly for internal profiling purposes and only keep track of anonymous demographic data (e.g., your age, usage
							of the LocoWise Pte Ltd website, favorite features).<br>
							<br>
							Our website contains links through which an online user can email us. We collect personal information contained in
							the email for the purpose of responding to a user’s questions and/or comments. From time to time, we may post on
							our website job openings at LocoWise Pte Ltd and provide an email address to which interested applicants can submit their
							resume. Although we can assure you that any personal information contained in a resume will be used solely for its
							intended purpose (i.e., to evaluate the applicant’s qualifications), such information is not subject to this privacy
							policy. No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only
							collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business
							objectives. </p>

							device that websites often store on a user’s computer. (You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when
							cookies are being sent to your computer.) This information may be used to make our website more interesting and useful
							to you. Additionally, we may combine this information with personally identifiable information to identify a user in
							order to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or to protect our service, website or users of LocoWise Pte Ltd’s website. </p>

						<p> LocoWise Pte Ltd reserves the right to use your company name, logo and other identifiable marks for any and all promotional
							purposes. If you do not wish to have you company name or mark used by LocoWise Pte Ltd you must opt-out by notifying us in
							writing: please contact us via email at <a href="mailto:privacy@locowise.com">privacy@locowise.com</a>. LocoWise Pte Ltd will take reasonable care in removing your

							use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality,

						<p> When you are using the LocoWise Pte Ltd website, certain content, including advertisements, may be created or hosted by a
							third party. Such third parties may place cookies and/or use web beacons, which may be used to identify some of
							your preferences or to recognize you if you have previously had contact with them. We do not control the use of

							located, you should not submit your personally identifiable information to LocoWise Pte Ltd. If you are located within

							provided in this privacy policy and to the transfer of that information to, and/or storage of that information

							to ensure you are aware of any changes. </p>

							secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information, we encrypt that information using secure
							socket layer technology (SSL). LocoWise Pte Ltd also has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality
							of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such
							information for the purpose of performing their jobs. The Internet is not a 100% secure medium. Although we use
							reasonable efforts to protect information, the potential of somebody breaching our security measures does exist. </p>
						<p> By using this website, you signify your assent to the LocoWise Pte Ltd Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this privacy
							policy, please do not use this website or applications. Your continued use of this website or applications will
							signify your acceptance of these changes.</p>
