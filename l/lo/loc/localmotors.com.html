        <p>Local Motors recognizes that its customers, visitors, users (designers, contributors), and others (known collectively or individually as "Users") who use local-motors.com (the "Website") value their privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services, and Websites offered by Local Motors, Inc., or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies and details important information regarding the use and disclosure of User information collected on the Website. Your use of the Website and any personal information you provide on the Website remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Local Motors Terms of Use. Please note that any comment or other content you post or send to the Website becomes published content and is not considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy. Your messages and other information you make available in public areas of the Local Motors website will be seen by people and organizations not related to or controlled by Local Motors, and may be used by others to contact you. Local Motors Privacy Policy applies only to Websites and services that are owned and operated by Local Motors. While other Websites may be displayed as links from within Local Motors, those sites are owned and operated by others, and they may have different privacy policies. When linking from Local Motors to other websites, if you have privacy concerns, we urge you to review the privacy policies of those sites.</p>

        <p>1. Information Collection and Use</p>
        <p>Generally Local Motors does not require that you register in order to view its products, designs, or User comments. Registration is required to use certain features such as posting comments, evaluating submissions, participating in the forums, submitting designs and participating in competitions. Local Motors collects personal information when you register with Local Motors, when you visit the Website, when you make a purchase, or any time you provide information to Local Motors about yourself. Local Motors may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. When you register, we ask for information such as your name, email address, and other personally-identifying information ("Personal Information"). When you register with Local Motors and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. Local Motors automatically receives and records other non-personally-identifying information ("Non-Personal Information") on our server logs from your browser even if you do not register with Local Motors, for example, your IP address, Local Motors cookie information, and the pages you visit. Local Motors uses Non-Personal Information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. Children Under 13 Local Motors is committed to protecting the privacy of children. Local Motors does not knowingly or intentionally collect personal information online from children under the age of 13. If Local Motors learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Website without verified parental consent, then Local Motors will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.</p>

        <p>2. Information Sharing and Disclosure</p>
        <p>Local Motors does not rent, sell, or share Personal Information with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Local Motors under confidentiality agreements.

However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Local Motors, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. We provide Non-Personal Information to interested third-parties for purposes of understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Website. We use both your Personal Information and certain Non-Personal Information to improve the quality and design of the Website and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends. We may share Personal Information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other forms of legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

We may transmit Personal Information if Local Motors is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Local Motors will notify active known users if there is a need to change this Privacy Policy based on a Local Motors acquisition or merger. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used. Keep in mind that any personal information, designs, or comments that you voluntarily disclose on the Website, for example on comment pages, or on the forums, becomes publicly available.
