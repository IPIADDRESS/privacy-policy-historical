<p>Locate A Doc uses technology provided by a third-party to serve ads when you visit this Web site. This technology may use information about your visit to this Web site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. We customize the advertisements that you see based upon: (i) the information that you knowingly provide; (ii) geographic location which we determine through your IP address; (iii) data we receive from third parties and (iv) your behavior on this Web site or other sites. In the course of serving advertisements to this Web site, such third-party advertising technology may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.
