                    <strong>HOW WE ENSURE PRIVACY IS MAINTAINED </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We endeavour to ensure that your data is stored securely and to prevent unauthorised
                        access. We have security measures in place to protect your information which we
                        monitor regularly. Unfortunately, despite our measures, because of the nature of
                        the Internet, we cannot guarantee that your information will remain at all times
                        100% secure. The continuing efforts of hackers to defeat even the newest of security
                        systems means that we can never make this promise. </li>
                    <li>Please be aware that if you disclose information on chat areas, forums or other
                        public services it may be possible for other people to use this information. We
                        are not responsible for the disclosure of any information you post in this way.
                    </li>
                    <li>Our policy is to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Regulation of
                        Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and all other legislation which governs the maintenance
                        of privacy in your information. We also require compliance with such legislation
                        by third parties with whom we have arrangements to offer goods or services through
                        the "ic" website. </li>
                    <li>Our web site provides a number of links to web sites not operated by us or by companies
                        associated with us. We take no responsibility for the use of any information about
                        you which is collected as a result of your use of these web sites and this privacy
                        policy does not extend to any web site operated by anybody other than us. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>DISCLOSING YOUR INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The personal information you give us is only disclosed to other businesses if we
                        have your permission. In particular, even where we have your consent we will only
                        disclose your financial, credit card or bank details to our agents and/or third
                        party suppliers of products or services on a need to know basis including, for example,
                        in relation to the fulfilment of any e-commerce transactions. </li>
                    <li>We may disclose details about use of our web sites to other businesses e.g. to demonstrate
                        patterns of use to advertisers and other business partners. The information we pass
                        on will not include any personal information by which you may be identified.
                    </li>
                    <li>We may forward your personal details to the Police or another regulatory body if
                        we are asked to do so or wish to do so in order to comply with the law or in relation
                        to any suspected misuse by you of our web site or any of our web site services.
                    </li>
                    <li>We endeavour to prevent unauthorised disclosures of your personal information by
                        other people, but we are not responsible for any unauthorised disclosures or other
                        breaches of security or for the actions of others if the information was passed
                        to them with your authority or with the authority of anybody other than us or our
