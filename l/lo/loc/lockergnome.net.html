<h1>Lockergnome's Privacy Policy</h1>

<p></p><h2>Logs</h2><p></p>

<p>Lockergnome logs all site visits and transactions. We collect the same standard
stuff: the type of browser you are using, your IP address, ISP domain,
time, date, pages viewed, and length of time that you spend visiting
our site. Before you start freaking out -- this data isn't used anywhere
but INTERNALLY. We won't share the specifics with anybody, and we
certainly don't care who you are. Well, so to speak. I mean, we
CARE about you, but we don't want to match individual users with
their specific Web surfing habits.</p>

<p>On Lockergnome.com, we only ask for your e-mail address. You don't
have to give it to us -- issues can always be viewed via the Web site.
Now, in our GnomeSTORE, we will ask for your name, address,
phone number, credit card number, occupation, postal code, city, state,
and country -- but that's only to process your order. We collect
the same information for <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com/">Gnomedex.com</a>
registrations. Any information collected will not leave our hands.
People may ask for general numbers, but there's no way we'll give
'em specifics. We respect your right to electronic anonymity.</p>


<h2>IP Freely</h2>

<p>We use a visitor's IP address to help diagnose possible problems
encountered on our servers. If there is a future contention,
then at least we have records on hand. An IP address may be used to
gather broad demographic information; again, this information is kept
internal. Honestly? We could care less where you're located on this
globe, but our sponsors seem to be attracted to demographic information.
Don't ask us why. Yell at them, not at us.</p>

<h2>Cookie Jar</h2>

<p>If you think that turning off banners is going to make the world a
better place, you're wrong. Free services aren't free to everyone.
That being said, we are currently using an internal ad
server to deliver targeted advertisments via the newsletter. If you
catch something.lockergnome.com lingering, it's doing nothing more than
offering you an image. Awwww... isn't that nice? We thought so.
That I'm aware of, Lockergnome.com properties don't give you cookies.
You'll have to turn to your grandmother for that kind of service.
Now, from time to time, external organizations may advertise on our
properties. If you wish to know who these companies are at any given
time, please ask. They will vary on any given day -- depending on which
programs are working better for us. Third party privacy policies are different
from  ours, most likely.</p>

<p>If a cookie comes along, believe me -- Lockergnome
isn't using it for anything and you have our permission to turn them
off altogether. Sometimes we can't get paid unless indentifiers are
loaded via the Web site or newsletters. These images are loaded
from affiliate sites; for example, Commission Junction of Google AdSense.</p>

<p>And you may have noticed our Job search engine. It's actually
not ours; it's Dice.com's, but they're partnering with us to
provide you with great occupational opportunities. Understand
that their privacy policy is completely separate from ours.
As would be the case for any company that isn't ours.</p>

<h2>Subscribing Safely</h2>

<p>Lockergnome's initial registration form requires you to give us
YOUR OWN e-mail address. This is used only for the distribution of our
e-mail newsletters. The personal data is never shared with an outside
party, and the subscriber database is never used for purposes other
than for distributing the requested newsletter(s). We do not purchase
outside lists to build the subscriber databases. You must
step through a confirmed opt-in procedure in order to be
accepted into our warm, loving family of Gnomies. That means
you have to submit a subscription request and IMMEDIATELY respond to
the specially-coded message which the list server sends to the
submitted e-mail address. Make sense? Okay, just type in your
e-mail address, hit the Submit button, check your Inbox in a
few minutes, then reply to the confirmation message to be
added to the list. Easy enough?</p>


<p>At any time, you may later review or update the personal information we have
collected online from you by contacting us at: subscriptions@lockergnome.com.</p>

<h2>Unsubscribing Safely</h2>
<p>Users may unsubscribe at any time. The databases for each list
are separate. The user will need to unsubscribe from one or
the other (or both) to stop receiving future mailings from our
organization. To be removed from our
databases, one must simply reply to a mailed issue. If that
doesn't work, then he or she can flail over to the
<a href="http://sub.lockergnome.com/">Subscriptions</a> page. Once there,
they may change or completely remove their address from our
list databases. The great thing about our list software is the user can see
his/her subscribed address -- if someone wishes to be removed from
our list(s), we will take every step necessary to get them
removed.</p>

<h2>The Missing Link</h2>
<p>
Our site and newsletter contain links to other sites. We are not
responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these destinations.
If you wanna click, it's your choice to click. Nobody's forcing
you to do anything. Of course, it won't do you much good to go
through life without exploring anything new. C'mon... where's
your spirit of adventure?</p>


<h2>You've Won</h2>
<p>For contests, we may ask visitors for contact information and/or
demographic information (postal code, occupation, or interests). The
person's contact information would be used to contact him or her when
e-mail does not work. What do we use this data for? Well, sometimes sponsors
want to know what kind of audience our newsletter tends to attract. We only
analyze group numbers -- never singling out an individual's
preferences or background. Isn't that clear yet?</p>

<p>If a particular contest rolls along and these policies change,
we'll be sure to note it clearly on the form.</p>

<h2>Telling a friend</h2>
<p>You will notice that you can 'Tell a friend about Lockergnome' on
our site. Rest assured that we do not keep their e-mail
address or store it in any way (if they do not subscribe, that is). The
form simply sends them an invitation to join Lockergnome. IP addresses are
logged and transfered only to stop possible misuse. So don't be
jerkin' our chain, dude.</p>

<h2>Family Room</h2>
<p>We will soon make newsgroups available to our users.
Please remember that any information disclosed in this area
becomes public information; one should exercise caution when
deciding to disclose personal information therein. Same goes for
the <a href="/community/chat.phtml">Lockergnome chat room</a> -- and any
other Lockergnome hosted forum. Be responsible for your own
actions and words. Nobody else will.</p>

<h2>E-mailing Us</h2>

<p>When you drop any of us an e-mail, we try to answer it within
a 24 hour period. Unless there happens to be a problem or issue,
these messages are treated as confidential. If a note must be
