      <h3>Disputes</h3>
      <p>
        All disputes, controversies and claims from or relating to this privacy policy, including any subsequent updates,
        shall be submitted to arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the AAA
        Commercial Arbitration Rules.  The place of arbitration shall be Austin, Texas and the proceedings shall be English.
        The arbitrator may award any form of individual or equitable and injunctive relief. Any award will be final and
        conclusive to the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  The parties may also plead to
        any court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim
        relief, without breach of this paragraph and without reducing the scope of the powers of the arbitrator.  You agree
        to the entry of injunctive relief to stop any lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in such a suit. By agreeing
        to this provision, you waive your right to bring, join, or participate in a class action lawsuit related to this
        privacy policy; however, you do not waive your rights or remedies to pursue an individual claim in binding
        arbitration.  The preceding provision is an independent covenant, which you may opt out of by providing written
        notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first use the LocalJobster website.
