  <p></p><h3>Cookies and Web Beacons:</h3>Locu.com and its partners use "cookies and other similar tracking technologies” to deliver and to enhance the use of the Service. A “cookie” is a small amount of data that gets installed on the hard drive of a User's computer serving as an anonymous unique identifier and allowing the website to recognize future visits using that User’s computer. We use tracking cookies to analyze User behavior on our site. For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous User, to offer personalized web page content and information for your use, and to otherwise facilitate your experience in connection with our Service. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. However, you may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but please be aware that doing so may affect your use of the Service (such as logging in to your account) and your ability to access certain features of our Service.<p></p>

  <p>We may use “web beacons” to compile tracking information related to our email campaigns. A “web beacon” is an electronic image, also called a "gif," that may be used on website pages to deliver cookies, count visits and compile statistics on usage and campaign effectiveness or in our e-mails to tell us if an e-mail has been opened and acted upon. None of the tracking information in these reports can be connected to the identities of individual Users.</p>

When we do use an outside company, we use contractual or other appropriate means to ensure that personal information is used in a manner that is consistent with this Policy.

  <h2>Links to Third-Party Websites</h2>

  <p>Our Service contains links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by "clicking on" a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>

If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:info@locu.com" target="_top">info@locu.com</a>.</p>

  <p>We may retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.  However, unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, the inherent insecurity of the Internet and other factors, may compromise the security of your personal information at any time. Therefore we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.</p>

  <h2>International Users</h2>

  <p>If you are located outside of the United States, please note that the Service is hosted in the United States. Therefore, your information may be processed and stored in the United States. As a result, United States federal and state governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through laws applicable in the United States. Your use of this Service or your submission of any personal information to us will constitute your consent to the transfer of your personal information outside of your home country, including the United States, which may provide for different data protection rules than in your country.</p>

  <h2>Children and Minors</h2>

  <p>The Service is not intended for use by minors under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly solicit any information from or market to such minors.
