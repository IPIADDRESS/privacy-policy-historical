by LOCALJOBSTATION.COM on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries 
and related companies (collectively, the "Websites"), (b)

Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1.1 Survey Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">LOCALJOBSTATION.COM collects 
information from individuals by various methods, including, but not 
limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an LOCALJOBSTATION.COM survey, 
order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means 
of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated 
by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, 
"online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, 
and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other 
than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones 
and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, LOCALJOBSTATION.COM 
or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to 
provide various information to LOCALJOBSTATION.COM, which may include his or 
her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers 
(including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary 
range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, 
employment information, personal and online interests, and such other 
information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey 
Information"). LOCALJOBSTATION.COM may also collect information concerning 
an individual from another source and uses that information in combination 
with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys 
is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to 
provide Survey Information to LOCALJOBSTATION.COM or Third Party, but an individual 
may receive incentives from LOCALJOBSTATION.COM or a Third Party in exchange 
for providing Survey Information to LOCALJOBSTATION.COM.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1.2 Third Party 
List Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">LOCALJOBSTATION.COM collects 
information from individuals when an individual provides information 
to a third party and LOCALJOBSTATION.COM subsequently purchases, licenses, or 
otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the "Seller"). 
Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's 
name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including 
cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, 
education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal 
and online interests, and such other information as the individual may 
have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). 
When acquiring Third Party List Information, LOCALJOBSTATION.COM seeks assurances 
from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party 
List Information to LOCALJOBSTATION.COM and that the Seller has a right to provide 
offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information 
is included on the Seller's list.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1.3 Other Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">Other occasions when 
LOCALJOBSTATION.COM obtains information from individuals include (1) when an 
individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive 
offered by LOCALJOBSTATION.COM or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests 
assistance through LOCALJOBSTATION.COM's customer service department, and (3) 
when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a LOCALJOBSTATION.COM service or 
newsletter (together, "Other Information").</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1.4 Cookies, Web 
Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">LOCALJOBSTATION.COM currently 
uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related 
information about an individual with information about the individual 
in our database. Additionally, LOCALJOBSTATION.COM may use other new and evolving 
sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>(a) Cookies.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">A cookie is a small 
amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer 
that allows LOCALJOBSTATION.COM to identify the individual with his or her corresponding 
data that resides in LOCALJOBSTATION.COM's database. You may read more about 
cookies at <a href="http://cookiecentral.com/" target="_blank">http://cookiecentral.com</a>. Individuals who use the Websites 
need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality 
of the Websites.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>(b) Web Beacons.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">A web beacon is programming 
code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an 
&lt;img src="x"&gt; programming function -- see <a href="http://truste.org/" target="_blank">http://truste.org</a> 
for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's 
unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database 
and associate the individual with previously acquired information about 
an individual in a database. This allows LOCALJOBSTATION.COM to track certain 
web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine 
products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track 
online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, LOCALJOBSTATION.COM 
might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon 
on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Joe, 
an individual listed in LOCALJOBSTATION.COM's database, visits the fishing website, 
LOCALJOBSTATION.COM receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited 
the fishing site, and LOCALJOBSTATION.COM would then update Joe's profile with 
the information that Joe is interested in fishing. LOCALJOBSTATION.COM may thereafter 
present offers of fishing related products and services to Joe. In addition 
to using web beacons on web pages, LOCALJOBSTATION.COM also uses web beacons 
in email messages sent to individuals listed in LOCALJOBSTATION.COM's database.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>(c) New Technology.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">The use of technology 
on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, 
as is LOCALJOBSTATION.COM's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, 
LOCALJOBSTATION.COM strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for 
any updates regarding its use of technology.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1.5 Outside Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">LOCALJOBSTATION.COM may receive 
information about individuals from third parties or from other sources 
of information outside of LOCALJOBSTATION.COM including information located in 
public databases ("Outside Information").</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1.6 Individual Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">As used herein, Individual 
Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, 
Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, 
and any other information LOCALJOBSTATION.COM gathers or receives about individuals.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1.7 No Information 
Collected from Children.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">LOCALJOBSTATION.COM will never 
knowingly collect any personal information about children under the 
age of 13. If LOCALJOBSTATION.COM obtains actual knowledge that it has collected 
personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information 
will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect 
such information, LOCALJOBSTATION.COM has no such information to use or to disclose 
to third parties. LOCALJOBSTATION.COM has designed this policy in order to comply 
with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1.8 Credit Card 
Information.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">LOCALJOBSTATION.COM may in certain 
cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the 
expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when 
an individual places an order from LOCALJOBSTATION.COM. When the Credit Card 
Information is submitted to LOCALJOBSTATION.COM, such information is encrypted 
and is protected with SSL encryption software. LOCALJOBSTATION.COM will use the 
Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the 
purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed 
to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.</font></p>

INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S 
SOLE DISCRETION.</font></p>
<p><font color="#414141" size="2" face="Verdana">The following paragraphs
