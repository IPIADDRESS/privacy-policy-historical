<ul>
<li>Performance of a contract – If you choose to make a purchase through the Websites or Apps, we need to collect and use your personal information to perform our agreement with you.</li>
<li>Consent – We may use or disclose some of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy subject to your consent.</li>
<li>Legitimate interests – We may use your personal information for our legitimate interests to improve our products and services.

</ul>
<h4>Transfer and Processing of Data</h4>
<p>For users within the United States, we process data in data centers located in the United States.  We have adopted reasonable physical, technical, and organizational safeguards against accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, access, use, or processing of user data in our possession.  We comply with state and federal laws governing the protection of personal information.</p>
<p>For users within the European Union, we transfer data from the European Union to data centers located in the United States for processing.  The European Commission has determined that the law of the United States does not provide a level of protection adequate to satisfy the requirements of Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and free movement of such data, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).  As to users residing in the EU, however, we extend the rights provided for by the GDPR – as detailed below – including the imposition of required safeguards with respect to accidental, unauthorized or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, access, use or processing of data.  Transfers of EU resident data from the EU to the United States from third parties (such as third party payment processors) are conducted in accordance with appropriate transfer mechanisms under the GDPR, principally contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.</p>
<p>If you are a resident of the EU, you have the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>request an accounting of all personal information that we possess that pertains to you in an electronically portable format (e.g., electronic copies of information attached to an email).</li>
<li>request that we change any personal information that pertains to you.</li>
<li>request that we delete any personal information that pertains to you.</li>
<li>fully or partially withdraw your consent to the collection, processing, and/or transfer of your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>To request an accounting of your personal information, a change to your personal information, deletion of your personal information, or to withdraw your consent to the collection, processing, and/or transfer of your personal information, contact <a href="https://loseit.live/help">Lose It! Customer Care</a>. Once we have received notification that you withdraw your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) to which you originally consented unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for further processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
<p>If you believe that we have misused your personal data, you also have a right to lodge a complaint with a national Data Protection Authority.  Each European Union member nation has established its own Data Protection Authority; you can find out about the Data Protection Authority in your country here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm</a>.</p>
<h4>Data Retention and Deletion</h4>
<p>We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting or reporting requirements.
<br>In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case it is no longer personal information.</p>
<p>It is our policy to retain personal information for 6 months once such personal information is no longer necessary to deliver the Website and Apps and to delete such personal information thereafter.  This means that, if you close your account with us, we will delete personal information associated with your account after 6 months. Regarding other types of information we collect as described in this policy, it is our policy to retain such personal information for 6 months and to delete such personal information thereafter.</p>
<h4>DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURE</h4>
<p>Lose It! does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser may be able to set the DNT signal so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.</p>
<p>Third parties that have content embedded on the Websites or App such as a social feature may set cookies on a user's browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited the Websites from a certain IP address. Third parties cannot collect any other personally identifiable information from the Websites unless you provide it to them directly.</p>

<p>We welcome your input on our privacy statement. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy statement, please contact <a href="https://loseit.live/help">Lose It! Customer Care</a>.</p>
