                    <p>When you use our Website, we collect certain information by automated or electronic means, using technologies such as cookies, flash local storage objects, pixel tags, web beacons (also called '1x1 pixel,' 'pixel,' 'Floodlight tag,' 'Spotlight tag,'), browser analysis tools, and web server logs. As you use our Website, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate and record the
                        interactivity and fill your requests for services and information. We may also use this to track transaction information, such as the printing or redemption of a coupon, with third-party affiliate network operators. Additional information on how to opt-out of certain tracking features is set forth in the Your Choices section below. </p>
                    <p>The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to our Website by your computers or mobile devices. These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers.</p>
                    <p>Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. "Session" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views. Your browser usually erases Session cookies once you exit your browser. "Persistent" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser. We may use Persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain
                        information you have previously provided (such as your user id if you asked to be remembered), and storing your preferences.</p>
                    <p>We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our Services, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. Our server logs also record the Internet
                        Protocol ("IP") addresses of the devices you use to interact with the Services. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our Services and the website you visit after you leave our Services, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.</p>

Additionally, emails we send may contain
                        a bit of code known as a "web beacon."

                        of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites.
