<h2 id="privacy-policy-title"><span>We Make Sure That<br>Your Information<br>Stays With Us</span></h2>
<br>
<p>
<strong><em>Information We Collect</em></strong><br>
We collect information in connection with our products and services in the following circumstances: (i) registering for an account, (ii) participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, and promotions ("Surveys and Promotions"), (iii) contacting LoudLaunch, and (iv) visiting and browsing any of our site. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the services we are able to provide you.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Personally Identifiable Information</em></strong><br>
We call information you provide that can be used to locate or identify you "Personally Identifiable Information." We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide our Services to you and to communicate with you regarding such Services.
</p>
<p>We collect Personally Identifiable Information in the following ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
  <li><em>Registration<em><br>If you register for LoudLaunch services as a website owner or SEO Agency partner, we collect information during the registration process. That may include your name, company name, company address, phone number, username, email address, and account password. We may also collect your IP address when you register and use our site. From time to time we may offer additional features, services, and promotional opportunities that may require you to submit additional information to participate.<br></em></em></li><em><em>
  <li><em>Contacting LoudLaunch<em><br>You may contact LoudLaunch by filling out and submitting a ticket form through a site when you are logged in to our site or by email us. When you contact LoudLaunch through our site ite, your full name and email address are transmitted to LoudLaunch. Any other information you choose to include in the form you submit would also be transferred to and stored on LoudLaunch's servers.</em></em></li><em><em>
</em></em></em></em></ol><em><em><em>
<p>
<strong><em>Anonymous Information</em></strong><br>
We collect Anonymous Information on our sites and blogger sites, through small text files called "cookies." We use both session Cookies (which expire when you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).
</p>
<p><em>How We Use the Information We Collect</em></p>
<p>
We may use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide information you have requested or products you have purchased (e.g., membership updates, e-mail newsletters, advertising insertion orders), to resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems. We also may use your Personally Identifiable Information to respond to specific inquiries made by you; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and to customize, measure, and improve our Services, content, and layout.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Behavioral Advertising Compliance Disclosure and Opting Out</em></strong><br>
LoudLaunch does not collect or use data of browsing behaviour or any data potentially used for online behavior marketing purposes. Data Retention Unless you contact us to request the deletion of your site owner account, we will retain data for as long as it is necessary to fulfill a legitimate business purpose or as required by law.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Phishing</em></strong><br>
We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your username, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to LoudLaunch. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is our top priority. For more information about phishing, you may want to visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt127.shtm
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Information Sharing</em></strong><br>
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Third Party Service Providers</em></strong><br>
We engage certain trusted third parties to perform various functions and provide services to us (for example, web hosting services and maintenance services). These third parties may have access to some of your Personally Identifiable Information, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your Personally Identifiable Information.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</em></strong><br>
We may choose to disclose some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information to the government, law enforcement officials, or private parties if we, in our sole discretion, believe it necessary or appropriate to comply with the law, to respond to legal complaints, to comply with legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the rights of LoudLaunch or a third party, to ensure the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally questionable activity.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Accessing and Changing Your Information</em></strong><br>
You may always access and modify certain of your Personally Identifiable Information you provide through LoudLaunch’s self-service e-commerce platform by visiting the "sign in" area at the LoudLaunch Domain. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Security</em></strong><br>
We place great importance on the safety and security of your Personally Identifiable Information. We employ certain physical, procedural, and technological measures in an attempt to protect your Personally Identifiable Information from unauthorized access and use. LoudLaunch’s servers that contain Personally Identifiable Information are stored in an off-site facility. LoudLaunch also uses hashed passwords, which allows an algorithmic version of your password to be stored instead of you actual password. When receiving financial information (e.g., PayPal account IDs) for completing certain online transactions, including those in connection with the LoudLaunch self-service platform, our site uses SSL or "Secure Sockets Layer," an industry standard security protocol, though other communications through the Sites are not encrypted. Although we do attempt to keep your Personally Identifiable Information secure, no security measures are perfect; there is always a possibility that a security breach could occur, resulting in the release of Personally Identifiable Information.
