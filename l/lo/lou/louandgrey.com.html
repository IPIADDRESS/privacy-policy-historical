					<p>ANN is committed to maintaining your trust and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share information collected about you.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Advertising member networks &amp; select companies. Like other retailers, ANN participates in advertising member networks with like-minded organizations where we may contribute certain information collected through our Sites â€“ including your name,
							postal address, email address, telephone number, purchase history, data collected through cookies and other technologies and geo-location data â€“ so that other members may inform you about products or services that might interest you.
							<br>We may also make your information directly available to select companies that we believe may offer products or services of interest to you or that help us better understand our customers and improve our services. If you would prefer that we
							not share your information with our advertising member networks or select companies, please <a href="#unsubscribe">click here</a>.</li>
						<li>Service providers. ANN shares information about our customers with service providers so that we can provide better service to you, such as collecting, storing and managing customer information; providing customer services; taking and fulfilling
							orders; processing credit card information; conducting promotions and surveys for our brands; suggesting store locations nearby and communicating effectively with our customers. We restrict those service providers from making any use of your
							information other than to help us provide better service to you.
							<br>We may also allow service providers to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies so that these entities can provide certain services to us. For example, we contract with service providers to serve
							ads on our behalf across the Internet. They will collect information about your visits to our Sites, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements
							for our products and services. These targeted advertisements may appear on our Sites or on other websites that you visit. Please <a href="#othertechnologies">click here</a> to learn more about your choices regarding targeted advertising. ANN also may share aggregated statistical
							or demographic information about our customers with service providers for customer analytics purposes so that we can better serve you.</li>
						<li>Co-branded partners. Co-branded partners are entities with whom we jointly offer a service or feature. You can tell when you are accessing a service offered by a co-branded partner because the co-branded partner's name will be featured prominently.
							You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a service offered by a co-branded partner. In doing so, you may be providing your information to both ANN and the co-branded partner, or we may share your information directly
							with the co-branded partner. Please note that the co-branded partner's privacy policy may apply to its use of your information.
							<br>In addition, we may offer scrip programs, which allow you to instruct us to divert a percentage of the amount you spend on ANN purchases to participating schools and other non-profit organizations, or loyalty programs, which allow you to earn
							"points" on purchases at ANN brands and use the points toward certain rewards offered by the loyalty program. If you choose to participate in any scrip, loyalty or similar program in which an ANN brand is a participating vendor, and you authorize
							ANN or our credit card processor to provide information about your purchases to the company administering the program, we will share your personal information with that program. The information you authorize us to disclose to the scrip or loyalty
							program may include your name, your credit card number, the date and amount of your purchase, and any other information you have agreed that we may share. Please note that once we disclose this information, the scrip or loyalty company may
							use and share it with others in accordance with its own privacy policy. You should review these policies carefully, as we have no control over them.</li>
						<li>Sweepstakes, contests or promotions. When ANN conducts contests, sweepstakes, promotions and surveys, or joins with other companies to do so, customers who choose to participate may be asked to provide personal information. We and the other
							participating companies may use this personal information for such purposes as notifying winners and fulfilling promotional obligations, and may also cross reference customer databases to identify common customers. Information from these activities
							may be used by ANN and the other participating companies to explore future promotional opportunities. Even if you have chosen not to receive e-mail or postal mail from any of our ANN brands prior to your participation in a contest, sweepstakes,
							promotion or survey, you may still receive information from our ANN brands in connection with that activity if you register for or participate in it. You may choose not to participate in contests, sweepstakes, promotions or surveys if you do
							not wish to receive information from ANN or share your information with ANN and the other companies sponsoring those activities.</li>
						<li>Legal &amp; other considerations. ANN may disclose your personal information to others if we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with law, regulation, legal process or government request; enforce the terms of any of our policies; or protect
							the rights, property or safety of ANN, our associates or our customers. We may also share your information in connection with or to effectuate a substantial corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely
							event of bankruptcy, reorganization or liquidation.</li>
						<li>With your consent. You may be notified at the time your information is collected that it will be shared with a third party. If you proceed with providing your information after receiving that notice, you will be considered to have consented
							to have your information shared with the third party.</li>

						decoded by anyone other than ANN. Our Sites also display the VeriSign Secure Site Seal, which indicates that our Sites have been authenticated by VeriSign and that we use SSL encryption to transmit confidential information during sales transactions.</p>
					<p>Specifically, once you enter the checkout page, your computer will begin communicating with our server using SSL encryption. You can determine the security of your connection by looking at the bottom of your Internet browser window after you
						have accessed our Sites. SSL technology is active if there is a solid key or a closed lock. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a security-enhanced server, the first characters of the site address
						will change from "http" to "https".</p>
					<p>Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through security-enhanced servers like the ones we use to process orders on our Sites. If you cannot access the security-enhanced server for any reason, you can place your
						order by calling 1-844-214-3434.</p>
					<p>While we implement SSL technology and other security measures to protect your information, please note that no data transmitted over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
