                                            <p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this Site.

                                            <p>We are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us.</p>

                                            <h2>The Way We Use Personal Information</h2>
                                            
                                            <p>If you submit Personal Information to us through the Site, then we will use your Personal Information to improve our services to you, to make certain offers or services, to contact you and to identify and authenticate your access to the Site`s services that you are authorized to access.</p>
                                            <p>We may transfer your Personal Information within Cyclicom or to Cyclicom`s third-party service providers, but only to provide services on the Site or to you, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
We may provide Personal Information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
                                            <p>You may choose not to receive email from Cyclicom by sending a single email with the subject "BLOCK" to <a href="mailto:privacy@lookuppage.com">privacy@lookuppage.com</a>. Please note that the email must come from the mail you wish to block.</p>
                                            
                                            <h2>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
                                            <p>Some of our Site pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Site user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.</p>
                                            <p>We use Remarketing with Google Analytics, along with other partners, for the purpose of online advertising. Google, as well as other third-party vendors, display our ads on websites across the Internet. To display ads, Google and other third-party vendors use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie). The cookies allow for third-party vendors, including Google, to serve and optimize the ads according to someone’s previous visits to our website. We place the cookie on a browser, and then a 3rd party (Google) reads these cookies and may serve an ad on a 3rd party site. These ads may be based on your past visits to our website.. You may opt out of this ad serving by visiting Google’s Ads Preferences Manager. If you are concerned about 3rd party cookies served by networks, you should also visit the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.</p>
                                            <p>You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter certain identifying information, should we in the future require such information, to gain access to certain parts of the Site.</p>
                                            <p>Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our Site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our Site and your web experience.</p>

                                            <h2>Notice</h2>
                                            <p>Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not currently provide your Personal Information to third parties, except for third parties who may perform services on the Site or to you. Nevertheless, we may at a later time choose to make certain offers or services available to our users from third parties. If we do, during the registration process and at certain points thereafter in connection with specific offers, we may ask you whether your Personal Information may be sent to third parties who have products, services and opportunities which may be useful to you. If you give your permission to allow third parties to contact you, your Personal Information (such as your contact information and other information collected during your visit to our Site) may be shared with data aggregators, marketers (possibly in the form of list rental), and other organizations. Cyclicom does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on Cyclicom`s behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Regardless of your decision regarding the sharing of your Personal Information, we may share broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information with our business partners. This aggregate information does not contain any Personal Information that can identify an individual user.</p>

The notices we will provide where Cyclicom collects Personal Information on the Site should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of the Site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.</p>

                                            <h2>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</h2>
                                            <p>In the event that Cyclicom is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors` rights generally, we may not be able to control how your Personal Information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
                                            
                                            <h2>Commitment</h2>
