<span class="bHB">Privacy Statement</span>
<p>Please read this privacy statement carefully. (Click <a class="vLK" href="termsandconditions.php"><b>here</b></a> to read Terms and Conditions ralated to using this website.) Privacy is very important to us. We also understand that privacy is very important to you. This Privacy Statement tells you how we protect and use information that we gather through this LOOKINGYOURBEST.COM web site.
By using this web site, you agree to the terms of the most recent version of this Privacy Statement. You may be subject to additional terms that may apply when you access particular services or materials on certain areas in this web site, or by following a link from this web site.</p>
<span class="vLKL">Introduction</span>
<p>The information we receive, and how we use it, depends on what you do when visiting our web site. We collect and use your non-personal information (information that is not identifiable to you personally) differently than your personal information.</p>
<span class="vLKL">What Is Non-personal Information?</span>
<p>Non-personal information is information we collect through this web site that does not identify you as an individual person. It may include information such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p">the type of web browser software you use (for example, Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer)</li>
<li class="p">the name of the domain from which you access the Internet</li>
<li class="p">the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our web site</li> 
<li class="p">the date and time you access our web site</li>
<li class="p">which pages you have visited on our web site</li>
<li class="p">personal information that has been de-identified</li>
</ul>
<p>If you visit our web site to read or download information, such as information about a health condition or about one of our products, we may collect certain non-personal information about you from your computer. This information is collected from your computer's web browser: If you only read or download information on our web site, we do not collect or learn your name, e-mail address, home address, or other personal information about you. We may place a text file called a cookie in the browser files of your computer when you visit. The cookie may be stored on your computerÂ¹s hard drive. The information that we collect using cookies is non-personal information. US Government Information Bulletin (I-034) contains a good description of cookie technology at: http://www.ciac.org/ciac/bulletins/i-034.shtml. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our web site may not work properly for you if you do so. We will not allow third parties to place cookies on our web site.</p>
<span class="vLKL">What Does LOOKINGYOURBEST.COM Do with Non-personal Information?</span>
<p>Because non-personal information cannot identify you or be tied to you in any way, there are no restrictions on the ways that we can use or share non-personal information. We are always looking for ways to better serve you and improve this web site. We will use non-personal information from you to help us make this web site more useful to visitors. We also will use non-personal information for other business purposes. For example, we may use non-personal information or aggregate de-identified personal information to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p">create reports for internal use to develop programs, products, services or content</li> 
<li class="p">customize the information or services that are of interest to you</li> 
<li class="p">share it with or sell it to third parties</li> 
<li class="p">provide aggregated "traffic statistics" and "response rates" to third parties</li></ul> 
<span class="vLKL">What Is Personal Information?</span>
<p>Personal information is information we collect through this web site that we can use to specifically identify you, such as your:</p>
<ul><li class="p">name</li> 
<li class="p">telephone number</li> 
<li class="p">e-mail address</li> 
<li class="p">medical device serial number</li> 
<li class="p">personal health information</li> 
<li class="p">date of birth</li></ul> 
<p>In some places on this web site you have the opportunity to send us personal information about yourself. For example, you may fill out a registration form, a survey, or an e-mail form.
You also may choose to allow us to personalize your visits to the web site, in which case we will ask you for certain personal information to make your visits to our web site more helpful to you. When this information is combined with the non-personal information that we collect through cookies (described above), we will be able to tell that you have visited our web site before and can personalize your access to our web site, for example, by telling you about new features that may be of interest to you.</p>
<span class="vLKL">How Does LOOKINGYOURBEST.COM Keep and Use Personal Information?</span>

<li class="p">for analytical purposes and to research, develop and improve programs, products, services and content</li> 
<li class="p">to remove your personal identifiers (your name, e-mail address, social security number, etc). In this case, you would no longer be identified as a single unique individual. Once we have de-identified information, it is non-personal information and we may treat it like other non-personal information.</li> 
<li class="p">to enforce this Privacy Statement and other rules about your use of this web site</li> 
<li class="p">to protect our rights or property</li>

<p>LOOKINGYOURBEST.COM will not share your personal information collected from this web site with an unrelated third party without your permission, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Statement.
In the ordinary course of business, we will share some personal information with companies that we hire to perform services or functions on our behalf.

In these cases, we provide the vendor with information to process your order such as your name and mailing address.

<li class="p">protect our rights or property</li>
<li class="p">protect someone's health, safety or welfare</li>

<p>Please note: In addition to the ways that we may keep, disclose, and use information described in this Privacy Statement, we also may keep, disclose, and use personally identifiable information that you give us through this web site in ways that we believe are consistent with FDA and other governmental guidance, directions, regulations, and laws.</p>
<span class="vLKL">What About Privacy on Other Web Sites?</span>
<p>This web site may contain links to other web sites. We provide the links for your convenience, but we do not review, control, or monitor the privacy practices of web sites operated by others. This Privacy Statement does not apply to any other web site. We are not responsible for the performance of web sites operated by third parties or for your business dealings with them.
