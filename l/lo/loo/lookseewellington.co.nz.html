                <p>Any personal information we hold will not be used by us for any purpose other than the one you provided it for, or disclosed to any other person in a form that will identify you except where you have consented to such disclosure, or where such use or disclosure is required or otherwise permitted by the New Zealand Privacy Act 1993, or otherwise required or permitted by law.</p>
                <p>You have the right to access and to request correction of any of your personal information provided to us. If you would like to see the personal information relating to you that we have stored, or to request correction of such personal information, or if you have any concerns regarding your privacy, please email <a target="_blank" href="mailto:privacy@hainesattract.co.nz">privacy@hainesattract.co.nz</a>.

                <h6>Lawful Basis for Data Processing</h6>
                <p>We will only collect, store, and process your personal information where a lawful basis for such processing exists, which will typically fall under one of the following scenarios:</p>

                </ol>
                <p>We may use your personal information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it.</p>

                <h6>Disclosures &amp; Transfers</h6>

                <h6>Retention</h6>
                <p>We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, or until you delete or ask for your Information to be deleted.</p>
                <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
                <p>We may periodically ask you if we can continue to hold your information.</p>
                <p>If you ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information we may not be able to provide our Services to you.</p>
