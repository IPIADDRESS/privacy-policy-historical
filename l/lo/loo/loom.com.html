                Welcome to Loom, the online and mobile service of Loom, Inc. (“Loom,” “we,” or “us”).  Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and users’ of our Service (“you” or “your”) choices about the collection and use of your information.

                <a id="1">1. HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION</a><br>
                Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Service <a href="/terms">https://www.loom.com/terms</a>.
                <br><br>
                We collect the following types of information about you:
                <br><br>
                Information you provide us directly: We ask for certain information such as your first and last name and e-mail address when you register for a Loom account, or if you correspond with us.  We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service.  We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.
                Information we may receive from third parties: We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the Loom application, linking your account to the Loom Service, etc., that third-party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Loom.  This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third-party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service.  You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Loom Service.  You may also unlink your third-party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third-party service.  If you unlink your third-party account, we will remove the information collected about you in connection with that service.
                Inviting a friend to use Loom from the “Invite friends” feature: If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third-party to the Service through our “Invite friends” feature, you may directly choose a friend to invite through your mobile device’s native contact list – but we do not require that you import your contacts list to the Service, and we do not retain the information contained in your contacts list. You understand that by inviting a friend to Loom through the “Invite friends” feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing your contact list. In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from you phone. Since this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication. 
                <br><br>
                Analytics information:  We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.  These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service.  We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.
                <br><br>
                Cookies information:  When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Loom help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.  A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our trusted business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.  Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site.  Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions.  A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.  You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
                <br><br>
                Log file information:  Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service.  When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information.  These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
                Clear gifs/web beacons information:  When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons), which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users.  In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.  The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
                <br><br>
                Device identifiers:  When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”).  Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device.  A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Loom.  A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service.  A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service.  Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
                <br><br>
                Commercial and marketing communications: We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you.  We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers.  If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences.  We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices).  You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails. 
                <br><br>
                Use of  certain service type information we collect about you: We use or may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to:  (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; (g) to provide advertising  to your browser or device, and (h) automatically update the Loom application on your mobile devices.
                <br><br>
                <a id="2">2. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</a><br>

                Who we may share your information with: We may share your information with third-party business partners for the purpose of providing the Service to you.  Those business partners will be given limited access to your information as is reasonably necessary to deliver the Service, and we will require that such third parties comply with this Privacy Policy.
                What happens in the event of a change of control: We may buy or sell/divest/transfer Loom (including any shares in Loom), or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses.

                Instances where we are required to share your information: Loom will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Service http://www.loom.com/terms or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Loom, our Users or others.

                <br><br>
                <a id="3">3. HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</a><br>
                Storage and Processing:  Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Loom or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. Loom may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.

                <br><br> 
                Keeping your information safe:  Loom cares about the security of your information, and uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service.  To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account.  You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Loom, at all times.  However, Loom cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Loom or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.

Loom is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third-party.
                <br><br>
