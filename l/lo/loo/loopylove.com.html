We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.<br>
<b>7.	HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR DATA FOR</b><br>
Generally speaking, we only store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Services to you and others, with information typically being held until you cancel your membership.
<br>
For data storage purposes however our users are considered as either being:
<br>
(a) Active Users; this means you regularly log on to our Services and use the Services in any way;<br>
(b) Inactive Users: this means that you have not cancelled your account but you havenât logged in for 4 months, or conducted any activity on our Services in that time;<br>
(c) Cancelled: this means that you have followed our cancellation process and actively cancelled your membership.<br>
<b>(a) Active Users</b><br>
If you are an Active User we will store your data until you cancel your account.<br>
<b>(b)	Inactive Users</b><br>
If you are an Inactive User, you should be aware that we will continue to store your data until you cancel you account, including continue to market to you if you have consented to marketing.
Just because you havenât logged on for a few months, we hope you will return to use the Services regularly and we want your information to be there for your convenience so you should be aware that you will still appear in our search results for other users, and your profile will remain visible.
The responsibility to change your preferences or cancel your account lies with you.<br>
<b>(c)	Cancelled Users</b><br>
If you are a Cancelled User, we will delete all of your data 9 months after the date of cancellation. It is important that we retain your data for this short period after cancellation to ensure that we can answer any payment or other account related queries, or provide information to third parties in line with our disclosure provisions outlined in this policy e.g. assisting police investigations.
Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or accessed on the Internet to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by other users or to the extent such information has been shared with search engines. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this.
If you have given third party applications or websites access to your personal information they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies.<br>
<b>(d) Storage of activity data</b><br>
Whilst we retain your Personal Data, Sensitive Personal Data and Anonymous Data as outlined at (a) to (c) above, there are some features of our Services that we store data in respect of, for different periods of time. For example, messages are only stored for 30 days, winks and other similar activities are stored for 10 days. All other profile and activity information including photographs, blocked list, search histories etc. are stored until 9 months after your account is cancelled.<br>
<b>(e) Banned and terminated users</b><br>
If your account is ever terminated by us, or you are detected as a potential or actual scammer, or a potential or otherwise threat to our business or our users, your email address will be retained on our internal blacklist for as long as we deem necessary to protect the business and its users.<br>
