<p>Maryme GmbH (“Maryme”) owns and operates a number of different sites on the Web (each, an ” Maryme Site”). Maryme is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its user community. The intent of this privacy policy is to detail the information Maryme may gather about individuals who visit the Maryme Sites, how that information is used, and Maryme’s disclosure practices. Please note that this policy applies only to the Maryme Sites, and not to the Websites of other companies or organizations to which we provide links or to any software that may be downloaded from the Maryme Sites.</p>
<h2>Anonymous User Information</h2>
<p>Maryme collects some anonymous information each time you visit an Maryme Site so we can improve the overall quality of your online experience. We collect your IP address, referral data, and browser and platform type. You do not have to register with Maryme before we can collect this anonymous information.</p>
<p>The Maryme Sites do not require you to share information that identifies you personally, such as your name or e-mail address, in order for you to use the Maryme Sites. The Maryme Sites assign an anonymous ID number to your requests and links the following additional data to that number: the date and time you visited the Maryme Site, your search terms, and the links upon which you choose to click. Like most standard Website servers, we use log files to collect and store this anonymous user information. Maryme analyzes the information to examine trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
<h2>Individual User Information</h2>
<p>From time-to-time the Maryme Sites request information from you that may identify you personally in addition to the anonymous information described above. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name, e-mail address, shipping address, and zip code), and demographic information (such as age, gender, occupation, and household income). Maryme will not use or disclose your individual user information except as described in this privacy policy. Maryme collects individual user information in the following ways from different Maryme Sites:</p>
<h2>Surveys or Contests</h2>
<p>From time to time, Maryme may conduct surveys or contests on a Maryme Site. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose individual user information to the Maryme Site. Contest information will be shared with the contest or survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Maryme Site. We may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests. These companies may use your personal information to help the Maryme Site communicate with you about offers from the Maryme Site and our marketing partners. Such third parties do not have Maryme ‘s permission to use your personally identifiable information for any secondary purpose.</p>
<h2>Directory Services</h2>
<p>Maryme offers certain personalization services within its directory services (i.e., White Pages and Yellow Pages) that enable you to give us your geographic location so we can remember it for you when you return to use our service. For example, if we know that you are searching from Bellevue, Washington for a particular company, we will pre-populate the city and state fields with Bellevue and Washington. While you are not required to use this feature of the directory services, the information enables us to provide you with a more efficient experience on the Maryme Sites. In addition, Maryme allows you to update, correct any errors in the listings, or include yourself in the directory services. In order to make these modifications, you may provide Maryme with certain individual user information that Maryme will use, along with its affiliates and third party service providers, to modify and update your information in the directory services database.</p>
<p>You may update or delete your White Pages listing by searching the White Pages to find your listing. Once you have located it, simply click the update or remove link. To verify your request, Maryme will send an e-mail message to the address that you provide. Once you confirm the request, your listing will be updated or deleted. Please allow approximately 24 hours for the update to become active after we receive your confirmation.</p>
<h2>Tell-A-Friend</h2>
<p>If you elect to use our referral service for informing a friend about any of our sites, we ask you for your friend’s name and e-mail address. Maryme will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the Maryme Site. Maryme does not store the information related to your friends and the one-time e-mail sent pursuant to your input will be our only contact with that person for such input.</p>
<h2>Correspondence</h2>
<p>If you contact Maryme, we may keep a record of that correspondence and we may collect your e-mail address.</p>
<p>Third Party Information Gathering</p>
<p>The Maryme Sites include content and ads from third parties that may perform user activity tracking other than that described herein. For more information about each third party content provider, cookies, and how to “opt-out”, please refer to such third party advertiser’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>The Maryme Sites contain links to other sites on the Web. Please be aware that Maryme is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Maryme may set and access Maryme or partner cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small data file that a Website may send to your browser and which may then be stored on your system. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For the session cookie, once you close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</p>
<p>We use cookie and web beacon technology to track which pages on the Maryme Sites our visitors view and which Web browsers our visitors use. We may also use cookies to help us provide personalized features and preferences to you within various Maryme Sites in a way that may be linked to individual user information that you elect to share with us. We also use “action tags” to assist in delivering the cookie. These action tags allow us to compile statistics and other data about our customers on an aggregate basis, by embedding a random identifying number on each user’s browser. Then we track where that number shows up on our site.</p>
<h2>Sharing</h2>
<p>Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a criminal investigation, a court order, or legal process served on our Website. We may also share your personal information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Maryme’s or such Maryme Site’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>Maryme Sites may use third party service providers to serve ads and e-mails on our behalf. These companies may use technologies to measure the effectiveness of ads and e-mails and use information about your visits to the Maryme Site so that we can provide a better search experience to you. For this purpose, we may also provide these third party service providers anonymous information about your site navigation.</p>
<h2>Mergers; Business Transitions</h2>
<p>In the event Maryme goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.</p>
<h2>Choice/Opt-out</h2>
<p>We desire to keep you in control of your personal information. Accordingly, you can review, correct, change or remove your personal registration information and elect not to receive future communications from us by sending us an e-mail at&nbsp;Contact us</p>
<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement in places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>If, however, we are going to use Individually Identifiable Information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our Website for 30 days.</p>
<h2>Special Notification with respect to Children’s Privacy (Users under the age of 13)</h2>
<p>In response to concerns about protecting children’s privacy online, Congress enacted the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Websites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with Maryme policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable information online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; or</li>
<li>Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties;</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately delete the information from our servers</p>
<p>Policy effective April, 2013.</p>
