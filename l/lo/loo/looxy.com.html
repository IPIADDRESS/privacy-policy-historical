We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

<h2>8. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR DATA FOR</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, we only store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Services to you and others, with information typically being held until you cancel your membership.</p>
<p>For data storage purposes however our users are considered as either being:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Active Users; this     means you regularly log on to our Services and use the Services in     any way;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inactive Users: this     means that you have not cancelled your account but you haven’t     logged in for 6 months, or conducted any activity on our Services in     that time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cancelled: this means     that you have followed our cancellation process and actively     cancelled your membership.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>8.1. Active Users</h3>

Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or accessed on the Internet to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by other users or to the extent such information has been shared with search engines. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your personal information they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies.</p>
