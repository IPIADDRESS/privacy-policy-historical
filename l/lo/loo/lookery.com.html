    <h2>Privacy at Lookery</h2>
    <p><strong>Lookery’s Privacy Policy</strong><br>
    <strong>Last updated May 12, 2009</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Lookery, Inc</strong> (“Lookery”) is a provider of targeted marketing technology and services to websites and online marketers, and considers the protection of your privacy to be of paramount importance. We operate demographic marketing services both on and more recently off Facebook. This Privacy Policy was prepared to describe how we use and collect consumer data in providing these services.</p>
    <p>Lookery helps websites collect consumer demographics and target advertisements on their websites or groups of websites. The information Lookery processes on such websites’ behalf belongs to those websites and is not further used by Lookery.</p>

    <p><strong>Personal Information (Not collected)</strong></p>
    <p>Personal information is data about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, that is not otherwise publicly available. Lookery has no place in its system for such information, in direct contrast to most other advertising networks. Please refer to their privacy policies.</p>
    <p>Lookery never uses, collects or keeps personal information about people who interact with any of the sites in the network.</p>

    <p><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong></p>
    <p>When you are on one of the websites (using Lookery products and services), the website, using cookies (see below), collects certain non-personal information from you, including but not limited to your browser type (for example, Firefox (which we highly recommend), Safari, or Internet Explorer) and your operating system (for example, Macintosh (which we highly recommend), Linux, or Windows). In addition, the sites in the network collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you visit the websites, referring URLs which brought you to those web sites, the ads that were on pages you visited, and other click-stream data, none of which will include personal information about you.</p>

    <p><strong>Registration Data</strong></p>
    <p>Some of the websites collect additional information about you through registration, for activities such as access to premium content, entering sweepstakes, or for fulfilling offers like email newsletter subscriptions. This information sometimes includes personal information such as your address or phone number which we never collect, and non-personal demographic information such as birth year, gender and metropolitan region, which is the basis of our system. Lookery may access the non-personal information that may have been collected in a registration environment. Personal information such as name, postal address, email address, and phone number is never accessed.</p>

    <p><strong>Customer Information</strong></p>
    <p>Prospective customers (websites and online marketers) can go to the www.Lookery.com site and provide their contact information to find out more and to be contacted by a Lookery representative. Lookery or its service providers reserve the right to use this information for business purposes such as marketing and research. Lookery and its service providers are prohibited from using this information for other purposes or from sharing this information with other companies. This information is not used for purposes other than responding to the request.</p>

    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>Nearly all websites, including those using Lookery services, use a feature of your browser to set a “cookie” on your computer. Cookies are small packets of data stored on your computer. The site placing the packet on your computer can then recognize the computer when you revisit the site. The site’s computer uses the cookie to provide services such as auto log on and relevant ad delivery, and to better understand how you are interacting with the site. These cookies effectively enable sites to better customize the site to your needs and interests, so that it can be as valuable to you as possible.</p>
    <p>You are always free to decline cookies, but by doing so you may not be able to use certain features on the websites or take full advantage of all the website offerings and targeted advertising. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, erase cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the ”Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)</p>

    <p>You can <a href="#opt_out">click here</a> to opt-out of data collection and targeting cookies from Lookery. Be advised that if you change computers or browsers, or use multiple computers or browsers, you will need to repeat this process for each computer and each browser.</p>
    <p><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong></p>
    <p>Non-personal information may be transferred or disclosed to the following entities for the following purposes: (1) to our affiliate websites to segment and target relevant advertisements to you; (2) to entities authorized to handle data such as: our employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, consultants, business associates, service providers and suppliers. Disclosure would be made only to enable any of these entities to perform a business, professional or technical support function for us; (3) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law; and (4) as provided for under the ”Unforeseen Circumstances” section below.</p>
    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
    <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. This includes the necessary physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect data integrity, access and use. Moreover, there is no place in our system for any personal information.</p>
    <p><strong>Unforeseen Circumstances</strong></p>
    <p>As we continue to develop our business, we or our affiliates may sell or buy other businesses or entities. In such transactions, any non-personal information we have collected from you may be one of the transferred business assets.</p>

    <p><strong>The Right to Change This Policy</strong></p>
    <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places where we believe you will see it, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here or by means of a notice on our home page and/or blog. This notification regarding the blanket right to change the policy is effectively a US legal requirement and not one that we can safely tone down.</p>

    <p>Opt out functionality is coming soon</p>
