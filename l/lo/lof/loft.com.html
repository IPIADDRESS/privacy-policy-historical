                    <p>ANN is committed to maintaining your trust and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share information collected about you.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Advertising member networks &amp;  select companies</strong>. Like other retailers, ANN participates in advertising member networks with like-minded organizations where we may contribute certain information collected through our Sites – including your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, purchase history, data collected through cookies and other technologies and geo-location data – so that other members may inform you about products or services that might interest you.
                            <br>We may also make your information directly available to select companies that we believe may offer products or services of interest to you or that help us better understand our customers and improve our services. If you would prefer that we not share your information with our advertising member networks or select companies, please <a href="#panel-unsuscribe" target="_self">click here</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Service providers</strong>. ANN shares information about our customers with service providers so that we can provide better service to you, such as collecting, storing and managing customer information; providing customer services; taking and fulfilling orders; processing credit card information; conducting promotions and surveys for our brands; suggesting store locations nearby and communicating effectively with our customers. We restrict those service providers from making any use of your information other than to help us provide better service to you.
                            <br>We may also allow service providers to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies so that these entities can provide certain services to us. For example, we contract with service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. They will collect information about your visits to our Sites, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for our products and services. These targeted advertisements may appear on our Sites or on other websites that you visit. Please <a href="#panel-other-technologies" target="_self">click here</a> to learn more about your choices regarding targeted advertising. ANN also may share aggregated statistical or demographic information about our customers with service providers for customer analytics purposes so that we can better serve you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Co-branded partners</strong>. Co-branded partners are entities with whom we jointly offer a service or feature. You can tell when you are accessing a service offered by a co-branded partner because the co-branded partner's name will be featured prominently. You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a service offered by a co-branded partner. In doing so, you may be providing your information to both ANN and the co-branded partner, or we may share your information directly with the co-branded partner. Please note that the co-branded partner's privacy policy may apply to its use of your information.
                            <br>In addition, we may offer scrip programs, which allow you to instruct us to divert a percentage of the amount you spend on ANN purchases to participating schools and other non-profit organizations, or loyalty programs, which allow you to earn "points" on purchases at ANN brands and use the points toward certain rewards offered by the loyalty program. If you choose to participate in any scrip, loyalty or similar program in which an ANN brand is a participating vendor, and you authorize ANN or our credit card processor to provide information about your purchases to the company administering the program, we will share your personal information with that program. The information you authorize us to disclose to the scrip or loyalty program may include your name, your credit card number, the date and amount of your purchase, and any other information you have agreed that we may share. Please note that once we disclose this information, the scrip or loyalty company may use and share it with others in accordance with its own privacy policy. You should review these policies carefully, as we have no control over them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sweepstakes, contests or promotions</strong>. When ANN conducts contests, sweepstakes, promotions and surveys, or joins with other companies to do so, customers who choose to participate may be asked to provide personal information. We and the other participating companies may use this personal information for such purposes as notifying winners and fulfilling promotional obligations, and may also cross reference customer databases to identify common customers. Information from these activities may be used by ANN and the other participating companies to explore future promotional opportunities. Even if you have chosen not to receive e-mail or postal mail from any of our ANN brands prior to your participation in a contest, sweepstakes, promotion or survey, you may still receive information from our ANN brands in connection with that activity if you register for or participate in it. You may choose not to participate in contests, sweepstakes, promotions or surveys if you do not wish to receive information from ANN or share your information with ANN and the other companies sponsoring those activities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal &amp; other considerations</strong>. ANN may disclose your personal information to others if we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with law, regulation, legal process or government request; enforce the terms of any of our policies; or protect the rights, property or safety of ANN, our associates or our customers. We may also share your information in connection with or to effectuate a substantial corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, reorganization or liquidation.</li>
                        <li><strong>With your consent</strong>. You may be notified at the time your information is collected that it will be shared with a third party. If you proceed with providing your information after receiving that notice, you will be considered to have consented to have your information shared with the third party.</li>

                        <li><strong>Social Networking or Other User-Generated-Content Sites</strong>.

The other site's privacy policy applies to any personal information you provide to that site.</li>
                        <li><strong>The ANN Credit Card Site</strong>. We may enable you to navigate easily to the site of World Financial Network Bank (WFNNB), where you can apply for an ANN-branded credit card and pay invoices online. WFNNB issues and owns the ANN-branded credit card accounts. When you apply online for an ANN-branded credit card or pay your account online, you leave our Sites and interact directly with WFNNB. Any information you provide to WFNNB is subject to WFNNB's terms, conditions, and policies, including its privacy policy.</li>

                    <p>We may also use Local Shared Objects (sometimes referred to as "flash cookies"), browser web storage (including HTML5) and application data caches. These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, and in connection with animated content on our Sites. These mechanisms operate similarly to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text.

                    <p>Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit this policy on responding to these signals.</p>

These and other third parties may collect or receive information about your use of our services, including through the use of cookies, web beacons and other technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected on different websites and online services. These service providers may use information about your activities on our Sites and other websites and combine that information with other information (such as an email address) to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. Some of these entities may be participants in the Network Advertising Initiative and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.

                    <p>The safety of your credit card information is important to us, and ANN has taken measures to help protect the security of your online order information.</p>
                    <p>ANN uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to help keep your online order information safe. SSL technology encrypts your credit card number, order information and personal information before it is transmitted to help protect it from being decoded by anyone other than ANN. Our Sites also display the VeriSign Secure Site Seal, which indicates that our Sites have been authenticated by VeriSign and that we use SSL encryption to transmit confidential information during sales transactions.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, once you enter the checkout page, your computer will begin communicating with our server using SSL encryption. You can determine the security of your connection by looking at the bottom of your Internet browser window after you have accessed our Sites. SSL technology is active if there is a solid key or a closed lock. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a security-enhanced server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https".</p>
                    <p>Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through security-enhanced servers like the ones we use to process orders on our Sites. If you cannot access the security-enhanced server for any reason, you can place your order by calling 1-800-DIAL-ANN or 1-888-LOFT-444.</p>
                    <p>While we implement SSL technology and other security measures to protect your information, please note that no data transmitted over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

Borderfree will be solely responsible for processing your financial transaction and we will not have access to your credit card information. Upon completion of your order, Borderfree will notify us of the approval of your order, and we will then ship approved orders to Borderfree. Simultaneously, Borderfree will purchase the product from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and arrange for the product to be delivered to you. In this process, Borderfree makes the sale to you as the merchant of record. When ordering a product, you will be presented with Borderfree's terms and conditions and privacy policy to which you must agree in order to complete your transaction.</p>
                    <p>Once you place your order, you will be prompted to confirm whether you would like to receive marketing and other communications from ANN brands. If you agree that Borderfree may share your data with ANN, we will protect and use your information in order to supply you with such communications and as otherwise set forth in our Privacy Policy.</p>

                            <br>We may also make your information directly available to select companies that we believe may offer products or services of interest to you or that help us better understand our customers and improve our services.

                        <li><strong><i>Service providers</i></strong>. ANN shares information about our customers with service providers so that we can provide better service to you, such as collecting, storing and managing customer information; providing customer services; taking and fulfilling orders; processing credit card information; conducting promotions and surveys for our brands; suggesting store locations nearby and communicating effectively with our customers. We restrict those service providers from making any use of your information other than to help us provide better service to you.
                            <br>
                            We may also allow service providers to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies so that these entities can provide certain services to us. For example, we contract with service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet.

                        <li><strong><i>Co-branded partners</i></strong>. Co-branded partners are entities with whom we jointly offer a service or feature. You can tell when you are accessing a service offered by a co-branded partner because the co-branded partner's name will be featured prominently. You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a service offered by a co-branded partner. In doing so, you may be providing your information to both ANN and the co-branded partner, or we may share your information directly with the co-branded partner. Please note that the co-branded partner's privacy policy may apply to its use of your information.
                            <br>In addition, we may offer scrip programs, which allow you to instruct us to divert a percentage of the amount you spend on ANN purchases to participating schools and other non-profit organizations, or loyalty programs, which allow you to earn "points" on purchases at ANN brands and use the points toward certain rewards offered by the loyalty program. If you choose to participate in any scrip, loyalty or similar program in which an ANN brand is a participating vendor, and you authorize ANN or our credit card processor to provide information about your purchases to the company administering the program, we will share your personal information with that program. The information you authorize us to disclose to the scrip or loyalty program may include your name, your credit card number, the date and amount of your purchase, and any other information you have agreed that we may share. Please note that once we disclose this information, the scrip or loyalty company may use and share it with others in accordance with its own privacy policy. You should review these policies carefully, as we have no control over them.</li>
                        <li><strong><i>Sweepstakes, contests or promotions</i></strong>. When ANN conducts contests, sweepstakes, promotions and surveys, or joins with other companies to do so, customers who choose to participate may be asked to provide personal information. We and the other participating companies may use this personal information for such purposes as notifying winners and fulfilling promotional obligations. Information from these activities may be used by ANN and the other participating companies to explore future promotional opportunities.

                    <p>The safety of your credit card information is important to us, and ANN has taken measures to help protect the security of your online order information.</p>
                    <p>ANN uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to help keep your online order information safe. SSL technology encrypts your credit card number, order information and personal information before it is transmitted to help protect it from being decoded by anyone other than ANN. Our Sites also display the VeriSign Secure Site Seal, which indicates that our Sites have been authenticated by VeriSign and that we use SSL encryption to transmit confidential information during sales transactions.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, once you enter the checkout page, your computer will begin communicating with our server using SSL encryption. You can determine the security of your connection by looking at the bottom of your Internet browser window after you have accessed our Sites. SSL technology is active if there is a solid key or a closed lock. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a security-enhanced server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."</p>
                    <p>Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through security-enhanced servers like the ones we use to process orders on our Sites. If you cannot access the security-enhanced server for any reason, you can place your order by calling 1-800-DIAL-ANN or 1-888-LOFT-444.</p>
                    <p>While we implement SSL technology and other security measures to protect your information, please note that no data transmitted over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

                    <p>ANN offers customers the ability to ship orders internationally. In these cases, ANN partners with Borderfree, ("Borderfree"), a U.S.-based service provider that we have contracted with to facilitate the sale and fulfillment of international online purchases. Borderfree will process your information in accordance with its privacy policy. To learn more about Borderfree's privacy policy, please visit <a href="http://www.borderfree.com/privacy" target="_blank">www.Borderfree.com/privacy</a>.</p>
                    <p>When we identify that your order is one that will be shipped internationally, we work with Borderfree to complete your order. On the checkout page, you will be required to submit credit card and contact information to Borderfree to complete your order. Borderfree will be solely responsible for processing your financial transaction and we will not have access to your credit card information. Upon completion of your order, Borderfree will notify us of the approval of your order, and we will then ship approved orders to Borderfree. Simultaneously, Borderfree will purchase the product from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and arrange for the product to be delivered to you. In this process, Borderfree makes the sale to you as the merchant of record. When ordering a product, you will be presented with Borderfree's terms and conditions and privacy policy to which you must agree in order to complete your transaction.</p>
                    <p>Once you place your order, you will be prompted to confirm whether you would like to receive marketing and other communications from ANN brands. If you agree that Borderfree may share your data with ANN, we will protect and use your information in order to supply you with such communications and as otherwise set forth in our Privacy Policy.</p>
