                        the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A "web

                        while browsing a website. As the visitor clicks through the website, a record of

                        have opened an e-mail we sent to you. Your browser may tell you how to be notified
                        when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain
                        types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able

                        You may see certain ads on other websites based on your visits to our Sites because
                        we participate in advertising networks administered by third-party vendors. Ad networks
                        allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and

                        logs and web beacons. The networks use this information to show you advertisements
                        that are tailored to your individual interests. The information our ad network vendors
                        collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the
                        vendors' advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and
