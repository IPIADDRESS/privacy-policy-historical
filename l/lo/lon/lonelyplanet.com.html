            <p class="unnamed1">Lonely Planet operates through different companies 
			  around the world that are all part of the <a href="lp_family.htm"><b>Lonely 
			  Planet family</b></a>. Individual Lonely Planet companies sometimes 
			  need to share personal information with other companies in the group 
			  to let us provide the quality products and standard of service you've 
			  come to expect of us. If corporate structure excites you, click 
			  <a href="lp_family.htm">here</a> to learn more about the Lonely

            <p class="unnamed1">There will be situations in which it is necessary 
              for us to collect information about individuals. We collect and 
              hold personal information such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, 
              and phone numbers. If customers choose to purchase Lonely Planet 
              products or services, we collect credit card details and other identifying 
              information in order to process orders and provide customer service. 
              Our writers (some of whom work on contract to us) may also collect 
              personal information in the course of gathering material for inclusion 
              in our publications (although you won't always know who they are 
              at the time as we need to get the real story!) Click here to read 
              our <a href="mpp.htm"><b>Media Privacy Policy</b></a>. The types of purposes 
              for which we collect information about individuals include the following 
              (we'll generally explain more about why we collect personal information 
              when we actually collect it - but there are some exceptions): </p>

            <ul>

              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> obtaining 

                and responding to feedback from travellers</font></li>

              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> allowing 

                people to share their experiences with fellow travellers on our

              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> sending

                on-the-road communications services<br>

                contacting customers with exciting travel news and great Lonely 

                Planet offers (but only if they have asked us to). </font></li>

            </ul>

            <p class="unnamed1">We may also collect information about individuals 

              involved in businesses, and this is mainly for: </p>

            <ul>

              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">preparing 

                listings and reviews in our publications</font></li>

              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> sending

                our products to distributors and retailers.</font> </li>

            </ul>

            <p class="unnamed1">If you work for us (as an employee or under contract) 
			  we keep information about you in the context of that relationship. 
			  There are some differences in how we deal with that type of personal 
			  information because of the relationship, plus some housekeeping 
			  stuff. If you are in this group and want further information on 
			  how we deal in the information about you, please contact your Human 
			  Resources manager or the person who manages your relationship with

			  about me! </a></p>

            <p class="unnamed1">One of the best things about the Lonely Planet 
			  community is that everyone is keen to share their views and experiences 
			  with others. (If you don't believe us, just check out the thousands 
			  of daily posts at the <a href="http://thorntree.lonelyplanet.com"><font color="#0066CC">Thorn 
			  Tree</font></a>, our message boards.) We welcome your contributions 
			  (please don't stop!). But remember, what's "gossip" to you may deserve 
			  "privacy" in someone else's eyes. We think everyone in the Lonely 
			  Planet community (or even outside it) has the right to some privacy. 
			  So please respect the privacy of others. If you want to include 
			  information about yourself we'll take it that you understand how 
			  our services work and are happy for that information to be shared. 
			  If you are <i>unhappy</i> that personal information about you has 
			  been included in one of our publications or on one of our bulletin 
			  boards, please <a href="mailto:privacy@lonelyplanet.com.au"><font color="#0066CC">let 
			  us know</font></a>. Where reasonable and possible we will remove 
			  that information at the next practical opportunity - where it has 
			  been included in one of our publications that may be the next reprint 
			  or next edition. </p>

            <p class="unnamed1"><a name="cookies" class="unnamed3">What about

            <p class="unnamed1"> A "cookie" is a small message given to your web 
			  browser by our web server. The browser stores the message in a text 
			  file, and the message is then sent back to the server each time 
			  the browser requests a page from the server. We make limited use

			  pages to your needs (this may include recording what region of the 
			  world you are from so we don't make the mistake of requiring you 
			  to buy stuff with British Pounds when you live in Fiji - or Australia 
			  for that matter at current exchange rates!). We do not match cookies 
			  to your registration details (that is, if you are registered with

            <p class="unnamed1"><a name="tellwho" class="unnamed3">You tell 
			  who?</a></p>

            <p class="unnamed1"> We may share personal information amongst companies 
			  in the Lonely Planet family. We may also disclose that information 
			  to our travel writers and other contractors who help us put together 
			  the Lonely Planet products and services you know and love and, where 
			  relevant, to our business partners who assist us in providing these 
			  products and services. We will generally provide you with more details 
			  about who we tell and why we tell them when we ask you to give us 
			  your personal details. There are some limited exceptions to this 
			  (for instance, where under Australian or other privacy laws we are 
			  permitted to rely on exemptions relating to handling of employee 
			  information, our activities in journalism, or information sharing 
			  between related companies in the Lonely Planet family). If legal 
			  or health and safety issues arise we may also have to make disclosures 
			  to relevant organisations to deal with these matters. </p>

            <p class="unnamed1">For some Lonely Planet services you can access

            <p class="unnamed3">A world without lawyers… </p>

            <p class="unnamed1">…it's a nice thought. However, for the time being 
			  the information handling activities of the Lonely Planet Group are 
			  governed by privacy laws throughout the world. For instance, in 
			  Australia that means being guided by the <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au/publications/nppgl_01.html"><font color="#0066CC">Australian
