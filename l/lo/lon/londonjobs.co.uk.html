	  <b>What Information we Need</b><br></font>
	 <font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
	 To provide the services you want, we need to know information about you, your skills and
	 job preferences.
     <p>If you enter a contest or promotion we ask for your name, address and e-mail address. 
	 This is so we can run the contest effectively and tell you if you have won.</p>
     <p>If you order Services from us, we will ask you for your Company name and address main
	 contact details, contact details for invoicing and information about who will use the 
	 Services.  Dependant on your payment terms, we may ask you for your credit card details.</p>
     <p>If you use our 'email a friend' service, we ask for the friend's email address. We then 
	 send an automatic, one-time email inviting your friend to visit us. Details of this 
	 transaction are stored only to send that one-time email or to track complaints of 
	 mischievous use.  Your friend may email <a href="mailto:help@londonjobs.co.uk">help@londonjobs.co.uk</a> to ask that it be deleted.</p>
     <p>We may use some of the information collected about you to personalise your visits to our 
	 Site so that the Site appeals to your interests and offers goods or services to you that 
	 you may want.   We can also use the information to help us develop the design and style of 
	 our websites to improve our service to you.</p>
	 <p>Occasionally, we will use your personal information to inform you about the latest 
	 changes to our Site, and products or Services that you might find interesting.</p>
	 <p>We will send you our newsletter if you have signed up for it.  You may unsubscribe at
	 any time using the link provided at the bottom of the newsletter email.</p>
	 <p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Site.</p>
	 <p>Our Site uses persistent cookies to keep track of your navigation, searches and actions
	 every time you visit the Site. These cookies expire after two years, and do not allow 
	 anyone to access your confidential information. If you are using a shared computer, please 
	 ensure that you log out of MyLondonJobs or close down the browser before leaving the

    <font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399"><b>Your CV</b></font><br>
    <font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We regard your CV as a very personal 
	document and we wish you to have full control over who can view it and whether or not you 
	wish to have your details (name, address, telephone number, email address, employment 
	history etc) visible to recruiters.
    <p>As an operator of a number of international recruitment websites, we give you the option 
	of putting your CV in our searchable database which is a significant aid to quickly finding 
	employment. We provide you a choice in how you do this. The choice allows you to select the
	level of confidentiality that you believe is appropriate.</p>
    <p>The level of control is provided to you by your choice of whether to make your CV 
	searchable by our Clients or not. Making your CV searchable considerably increases your 
	exposure to potential employers. To prevent your CV from being searched and viewed by our 
	Clients you should choose to "hide" your CV during the registration process. Choosing "hide"
	means that your CV is not accessible by any recruiter but you can gain access to it and use 
	it when applying for individual jobs.</p>
	<p>We use our best efforts to limit access to our CV services to recruiters who agree to 
	abide by our terms and conditions. If any recruiter is found to be in breach of these terms 
	and conditions, then we will immediately terminate their use of our Services. A link to our 
	<a href="http://www.londonjobs.co.uk/client_terms">Client terms and conditions</a> may be found at the bottom of this page.</p>
	<p>You may remove your CV from our searchable database at any time. However, recruiters who
	have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your CV in their own files
	or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of your CV by 
	recruiters in these instances.</p></font>
	<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399"><b>Jobs-by-Email</b></font><br>
	<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Jobs-by-Email service matches a job
	seeker's requirements for employment with the profile of vacancies advertised on our Site.
	For job seekers who subscribe to this Service you receive an email listing those jobs that 
	we believe you should be interested in. You define your requirements by creating "strings" 
	which can be used to specify geographic region, specific job titles, skills or other 
	definition of the job you want. You can change the strings at any time or unsubscribe at 
	any time.</font><br><br>
	<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399"><b>Filtering Forms</b></font><br>
	<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you apply for positions with some 
	of our Clients, you will be requested to complete a Filtering Form.  The information 
	submitted by you on the Filtering Form will be used by our Client to assess your suitability
	for the position to which it applies. We are not responsible for framing the questions in 
	our Client's Filtering Forms, and merely provide the electronic means to enable our Client 
	to present the Filtering Form to you, and to collect the Filtering Form once it has been 
	completed by you. We do not process any of the data in completed forms, which we present to
	our Clients in our Applicants' database. We may, however, temporarily store your completed 
	forms.</font><br><br>
