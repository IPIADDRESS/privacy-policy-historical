                We understand that our users are our  most valuable commercial asset. Their welfare is critical to our success and we  understand that, accordingly, we have a serious and ongoing interest in the  privacy of our users. </p>
                <p>We believe that a rational and sensible policy for the  privacy of information should shield our users to the greatest extent  reasonably possible against indiscriminate disclosure of private information,  to the extent compatible with the functionality of our service and its  commercial purposes, from those who do not have a practical need or reasonable  commercial purpose in possessing the information. This Policy explains how we  aim to protect the user's privacy and how we determine and implement the  appropriate and reasonable balance of privacy and disclosure consistent with  the practical necessities of functionality and economic viability. </p>
