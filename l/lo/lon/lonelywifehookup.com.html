<b>OUR WEB SITE PRIVACY POLICY</b>
<br><br>
We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm
commitment to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices with
respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal and non-personal
information provided by visitors to our Web site. By using this site,
you signify your assent to these our privacy practices and the terms
and conditions of our Web site.
<br><br>
<b>If this policy is not agreeable to you, please do not use this site.</b>
<br><br>
<b>WHAT TYPE INFORMATION IS COLLECTED?</b> <br>
<b>Personal Information</b> <br>
We only collect personal information from visitors to our Web site when they voluntarily provide it to us by completing our registration form or electing to use one of our services. We may require visitors to provide us with additional information to verify their identity to assist in the event of a lost user name or password (such as mother's maiden name). Credit Card information is not stored or collected by us; rather this information is collected by the payment processing company identified on the join page and transmitted via Secure Socket Layer technology. Your credit card information is NEVER known to us and cannot be shared by us.
<br><br>
<b>Non-Personal Information</b> <br>
When visitors access our Web site, certain non-personal information may be collected from them including, but not limited to, their browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), IP address, and the domain name from which they accessed the site (e.g., google).  In addition, we may collect information
about visitors' browsing behavior, such as the date and time they visit
the Web site, the areas or pages of our Web site that they visit, the
amount of time spent viewing the site, the number of times the visitor
returns to the site, and click-stream data. We use transparent tracking
pixels to determine the number of Web site visitors that have been sent
to us through our affiliate network. We do not track any information
about visitors once they leave our site. We may use cookies (small text
files that are stored on visitors computers when they access our Web
site) to collect this information. Information collected through cookies
may be combined with visitors' personal information. We may also allow
unaffiliated third parties, such as advertisers, to serve cookies to
visitors of our Web site. Visitors are always free to decline cookies,
but in doing so they may not be able to use certain features on our
Web site. The "help" segment of the toolbar on most browsers
explains how to configure a browser to not accept new cookies, how to
have the browser inform a user when they receive a new cookie, and how
to erase cookies from their hard drives.
<br><br><b>IN WHAT WAY DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION?</b> <br>
Our goal in collecting personal information is to provide visitors with
the most personalized Web experience possible and our advertisers with
an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing a little
about our visitors, we are able to deliver more relevant content and
advertisements, and provide better services. We may use information
collected from visitors to our Web site for any of the following purposes:
(1) to send visitors information and promotional materials about our
company, (2) to send visitors information and promotional materials
from our marketing partners and third parties (such as advertisers on
our Web site), (3) to deliver targeted display advertisements and offers
by email (by matching criteria provided by our advertisers with information
collected from our visitors), (4) to contact visitors to our Web site
when necessary, (5) to allow one-click purchases or access to proprietary
content by pre-populating fields, within registration or other transaction
screens, with a visitor's name, billing address, and credit or charge
card information (among other things), as provided by that visitor,
(6) to help diagnose problems with our server, (7) to administer our
Web site, (8) to conduct internal reviews of our site (e.g., to determine
the number of visitors to the site), (9) to help us better understand
visitors' use of our site, and (10) to protect the security or integrity
of our site. Non-personal information will be used for purposes of conducting
internal reviews of the site, monitoring the site, and providing a greater
online experience for our visitors.
<br><br>
<b>DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION?</b> <br>
We may transfer or disclose information collected from visitors to our
Web site to our employees and independent contractors, to our parent
company, subsidiaries and affiliates, and to our consultants, other
business associates, and suppliers, if the disclosure will enable that
party to perform a business, professional, or technical support function
for us, or if required to do so by law. We may also disclose information
we collect from our site visitors to our marketing and business partners,
who may use the information in connection with their business operations,
such as to send marketing and other communications to visitors of our
site.  <br>
We may also share, rent, sell, or transfer any personal information
(including financial information) provided by our visitors to third
parties. During the registration process, and at certain times during
any member user session, we may present additional offers from third
party service providers. Our third party service providers have their
own terms and conditions and privacy policies. We suggest that visitors
access these third party sites and review their terms and conditions
and privacy policies before "subscribing" to any third party
offer. If a visitor subscribes to a third party offer during our registration
process, we will transfer the financial data they provided to us as
part of the registration process to that third party company, which
will then process the transaction using that financial data. We may
also share non-personal information we collect from visitors to our
site, such as their browsing behaviors, with third parties. For example,
we may tell a third party advertiser that a certain number of people
have visited a certain area on our Web site.
<br><br><b>WHAT SECURITY MEASURES DO WE TAKE TO PROTECT YOUR DATA?</b> <br>
To help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data integrity, and ensure
the appropriate use of information, we have put in place certain physical,
electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information
we collect from visitors to our Web site. SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
technology protects any credit card information you provide. We allow
access to personal information only to persons and entities engaging
in activities provided for by this Privacy Policy. Visitors should consider
any communication that they transmit to us (such as data, questions
or answers, comments, suggestions, or communications submitted to a
chat room) to be non-confidential. We will not be liable or responsible
if information that belongs to a visitor is intercepted and used by
an unintended recipient.
<br><br><b>WE PROTECT CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</b> <br>
Protecting the privacy of children is VERY important to us. For that
reason we do not structure any part of our site to attract anyone under
the age of 18 (21 in some areas) and we do not allow anyone under the
age of 18 (21 in some areas) to register and become a member of our
site.
<br><br><b>CORPORATE CHANGES</b> <br>
In the event of a merger, acquisition, asset or stock sale, bankruptcy,
or other asset transfer (regardless of legal formality), any of our
assets may be transferred to a third party, including personal information
collected from visitors to our Web site.
<br><br><b>ACCEPTANCE OF PRIVACY TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</b> <br>
By visiting this Web site, you are agreeing to the practices described
in this Privacy Policy. By visiting this site, you also accept, without
limitation or qualification, all terms and conditions concerning the
use of this site. We may at any time revise these terms and conditions.
You are bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically
visit this page to review the then-current terms and conditions to which
you are bound. To the extent that any of the third-party sites accessible
through our Web site (such as our advertisers) have different privacy
practices from those stated in this Privacy Policy, those third-party
privacy practices govern the collection and use of information you provide
when visiting those sites. We are not responsible for the policies,
content, and practices of other companies.
<br><br><b>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b> <br>
There may be times when we need to change the terms of this Privacy
Policy. To ensure that you are aware of our current privacy practices, <b>
please bookmark this page and check back often.</b>
<br><br><b>HOW TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION</b> <br>
You can cancel your subscription online by visiting the Customer Service
section of the site you joined.
<br><br><b>HOW CAN YOU ACCESS THE INFORMATION WE HAVE COLLECTED FROM YOU?</b> <br>
Visitors who wish to access or change the information they provided
to our Web site, should visit the Customer Service section of this site
and contact us via Email.
<br><br><b>HOW CAN YOU CONTACT THE WEB SITE OPERATOR?</b> <br>
