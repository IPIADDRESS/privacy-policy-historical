    <p>LondonFog.com respects the privacy of our customers and the users of our website
    and has instituted the policies and practices described below to ensure that your
    personal information is handled appropriately. Our online privacy policy describes
    the types of personal information we may collect from you when you visit our website
    and when we share it with third parties. The information on this website and our
    privacy policy are subject to change from time to time. Any material changes to
    our privacy policy and practices will be reflected on this page so that you can
    be aware of what information we collect and how we are using and/or disclosing it.
    By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this information
    by London Fog.com.<br>
    <br>
</p>

<h3><a name="info">What information does LondonFog.com collect?</a></h3>
<p>
    LondonFog.com collects data that you provide on LondonFog.com, email registration,
    sweepstakes, contests, or online membership; or through phone, mail and fax interactions
    or paper registrations that you submit.</p>
    <p>
    LondonFog.com may collect and store two types of information: "personal information"
    and "automatic information."</p>
    <p>
    Personal information tells us who you are such as your name, gender, billing address,
    shipping address, email address, telephone number, date of birth or age, any personal
    preferences you choose to provide, transaction details such as style, size, price,
    discount, date, your credit card number and expiration date used for transactions,
    and an assigned password to protect your privacy.</p>
    <p>
        Automatic information is information that we collect automatically whenever you 
        interact with this website such as your IP address, the type of computer you 
        use, and the web browser you use. An IP address is a number assigned to your 
        computer when you connect to the Internet. Each time you visit this site, our 
        web server may automatically recognize and collect this information. Automatic 
        information also includes "cookies" and "web beacons". A "cookie" is a small 
        amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your 
        computer's hard drive. Among other things, cookies provide a means for us to 
        keep track of your online patterns and preferences. By understanding which areas 
        of the site you visit, cookies allow us to present information, products and 
        services that are of personal interest. A cookie will not allow us to learn any 
        personal information (such as your real name and address) that you have not 
        otherwise disclosed. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You 
        can change your browser so that it will not automatically accept cookies. 
        However, if you do so, it is possible that some portions of the site may not 
        function as intended. "Web beacons", also known as clear GIFs or single-pixel 
        GIFs, are small image files that we may place on web pages and within web-based 
        email newsletters that we send. Working in conjunction with cookies, web beacons 
        allow us to accurately count the number of unique users who have visited a 
        specific page and the number of times those pages are displayed. We can also use 
        web beacons to let us know how many people opened a web-based email newsletter.</p>
    <p>
    We may associate automatic information with your personal information. In the event
    of such association, such automatic information will be considered personal information.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="use">How does LondonFog.com use this information?</a></h3>
<p>
    LondonFog.com uses this information to confirm and process sales transactions or
    to contact you with questions or communications about your order, or to respond
    to your customer service inquiries.</p>
    <p>
    LondonFog.com also uses this information to enhance and personalize your shopping
    experience, both online and in our stores, to communicate with you for marketing
    and promotional purposes including via targeted postal pieces, phone messages, or
    personalized emails, and to improve the effectiveness of our websites and business
    activities. You may indicate your contact preferences regarding promotional communications
    either directly to us online or to customer service representatives.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="protect">How does LondonFog.com protect your information?</a></h3>
<p>
    Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be unconditionally guaranteed
    to be secure. Therefore any information you transmit to us is sent at your own risk.</p>
    <p>
    However, when you place an order online, we use encryption technology, such as Secure
    Socket Layer Technology ("SSL"), to protect your personal information during data
    transport. SSL encrypts your order information, including your name, address, and
    credit card number, before it is transmitted to us to avoid the decoding of your
    information by anyone other than LondonFog.com.</p>
    <p>
    In addition, when you create an online account on LondonFog.com, you must select
    a personal password. As a member of LondonFog.com website, you will be able to view,
    among other things, your account profile, contact preferences, order history, address
    book. We store this type of information so that you do not have to reenter it each
    time you make a purchase or visit the website. Should you decide to become a member
    of LondonFog.com’s website, you will be asked to provide an accurate email
    address and create a password. In order to help protect your personal information,
    you should be careful about maintaining the secrecy of your password.</p>
<h3><a name="disclosure">Does LondonFog.com disclose your information to others?</a></h3>
    <p>Except as described in this privacy policy, LondonFog.com does not sell, rent or
    trade with third parties any personal information you provide to us online or at
    our stores, nor do we share such information with third parties. We may disclose
    personal information about you to third parties who provide services to us and who
    agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information in accordance with this
    privacy policy and use the information only in connection with the services they
    provide. These third parties may provide a variety of services to us including,
    without limitation, assisting us in fulfilling your transactions and customer service
    inquiries, updating your customer information record in our database, deploying
    our promotional offers to you, or fulfilling your request to unsubscribe from our email. We do not authorize those third parties to make
    any other use of your information.</p>
    <p>We may use and/or disclose to others information about your demographics and use
    of our website in a manner that does not reveal your identity.</p>
    <p>We may disclose personal information in special cases when we have reason to believe
    that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal
    action against someone who may have breached our <a href="/terms.asp" rel="width: 600,height:400" class="nolightwindow">
        Conditions of Use</a> or who may be causing injury to or interference with (either
    intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users of our website,
    or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.</p>
    <p>We may also disclose personal information when we reasonably believe that the law
    requires it. We might sell or buy subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions,
    personally identifiable information generally is one of the transferred business
    assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy.
    Also, in the unlikely event that assets of Anne Klein are sold, personal information
    may be one of the transferred assets.</p>
    <h3>Can I unsubscribe?</h3>
<p>
    Yes. LondonFog.com honors requests to unsubscribe from receipt of emails, not only
    for promotional emails that LondonFog.com sends, but also for emails about LondonFog.com
    that we permit other companies to send to their own list of subscribers.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="links">Does LondonFog.com have links to other web sites?</a></h3>
<p>
    While you are using this website, you may be linked or directed to other third party
    sites outside of the website that are beyond our control. Each of these third parties
    may have a privacy policy different from ours. For example, you might click on a
    link or banner ad that will take you off the website. These links and banners may
    take you to sites of advertisers, sponsors and co-branding partners. Please review
    the privacy policies of these sites. We are not responsible for any actions or policies
    of such third parties.</p>
    <p>We welcome your comments regarding this privacy policy. Please send any concerns
    to:</p>
