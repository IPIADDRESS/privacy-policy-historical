      <p>londonfog.com values its customers and respects their privacy. We 
        collect customer information in an effort to improve our customers' shopping 
        experience and to communicate with our customers about our products, services, 
        contests and promotions. We recognize that we must maintain and use customer 
        information responsibly. We do not sell or rent the information you provide 
        to us online to third parties. However, we do share your information with 
        third parties under certain circumstances. This policy describes the personal 
        information we collect about you, why we collect it, how we use it and 
        when we share it with third parties. Our policy also describes the choices 
        you can make about how we collect and use your information. <br>
        <br>
        If our information practices change in the future, we will let you know 
        before we use your information in a manner not previously disclosed in 
        our privacy policy by posting the policy changes on our website or by 
        communicating directly with you. At that time, you will have the opportunity 
        to opt out of any new use of your information.<br>
        <br>
        <span><strong>What kind of information does londonfog.com collect?</strong></span></p>
      <p>We collect information, such as your name, E-mail and postal addresses, 
        phone and credit card numbers, that you provide to us when you place an 
        order, when you save your info with us or when you participate in a contest, 
        promotion or survey. We may acquire from third parties names, E-mail and 
        postal addresses for select mailings. <br>
        <br>
        <span><strong>How does londonfog.com use my information?</strong></span></p>
      <p>When you make a purchase from londonfog.com, we use your information 
        to process your order. We will also send you E-mails to confirm your order 
        and may need to contact you via phone, postal mail or E-mail if we have 
        other questions regarding your order. <br>
        <br>
        When you save your information with londonfog.com, you will be automatically 
        signed up to receive E-mail updates. If you participate in a contest or 
        promotion, you will have the opportunity to choose to receive E-mails from 
        us regarding our products, services, contests and promotions. <br>
        <br>
        If at any time you would like us to remove you from our E-mail or postal 
        mailing lists, feel free to contact us by contacting londonfog.com 
        customer service via E-mail. Please be sure to include your E-mail address, 
        full name and password. If you have previously asked to be removed from 
        our E-mail mailing list, we will not sign you up for E-mail updates if you 
        place an order online. Please note that it may take up to 48 hours to 
        remove your E-mail address from our list. <br>
        <br>
        From time to time, we may also send you E-mails to help us learn more about 
        your shopping preferences. In addition, we use information about your 
        product interests and purchases to help us improve our site design and 
        your shopping experience. If you save your information with us or if you 
        purchase from us online we may also send you notices about our products, 
        services, contests and promotions through postal mail. <br>
        <br>
        To serve you better, we may combine information you give us online about 
        your product interest and purchases with demographic information that 
        is publicly available. We use that combined information to enhance and 
        personalize your shopping experience with us, and to communicate with 
        you by E-mail or postal mail about our products, services, contests and 
        promotions that may be of interest to you. <br>
        <strong><br>
        <span>Does londonfog.com share my information with third parties?</span></strong></p>
      <p>We contract with third parties to assist us in maintaining and managing 
        our customer information, to fulfill promotions and to communicate with 
        our customers. We do not authorize any of those third parties to make 
        any other use of your information. <br>
        <br>
        When we offer contests and promotions, or join with other companies to 
        do so, customers who choose to participate in those contests and promotions 
        may be asked to provide personal information to participate. That information 
        may then be used by us and by any company offering the contest or promotion 
        to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations. <br>
        <br>
        In addition, when we team up with another company to offer or provide 
        products, services, contests or promotions, we and the other company may 
        cross-reference our customer databases to identify common customers. We 
        and the other company may use that existing information to identify future 
        promotional opportunities and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations. 
        <br>
        <br>
        If, prior to participating in a contest or promotion, you opted not to 
        receive information about or mailings from us, you may still receive information 
        from or about londonfog.com in connection with the contest or promotion 
        if you choose to register for or participate in it. You may opt not to 
        participate in these contests or promotions if you do not want to receive 
        information about londonfog.com or share your information with londonfog.com 
        and the other companies sponsoring those contests or promotions. </p>
      <p>If you are a catalog customer, we may share your name and mailing address 
        with third parties that have products or services we think may interest 
        you. We also may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information 
        about you, such as age, gender and types of products purchased, with our 
        business partners to fulfill our contractual obligations. Except as described 
        above, we do not share, rent or sell any information we collect online 
        to any unaffiliated third party. <br>
        <br>
        <span><strong>How do I access my information? How do I change or delete 
        my information?</strong></span></p>
      <p>Simply <span><a href="/store/os/login.aspx"><strong>log into your account</strong></a></span> 
        to change your information.<br>
        <span><br>
        <strong>How does londonfog.com protect kids' privacy?</strong></span></p>
      <p>Like you, we at londonfog.com are concerned about the safety of 
        children when they use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online 
        Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally 
        identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior 
        verifiable parental consent. If we receive actual knowledge that a subscriber 
        to londonfog.com is under the age of 13, we will remove all personally 
        identifiable information about that person from our files. <br>
        <br>
        <span><strong>What are cookies? How does londonfog.com use cookies 
        on its site?</strong></span></p>
      <p>A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's 
        hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information, 
        such as a unique user ID that websites use to track the pages of the sites 
        you've visited. We use cookies but do not store personally identifiable 
        information in your cookie. <br>
        <br>
        We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. Cookies enable 
        us to keep track of your order as you shop on our site. Through our use 
        of cookies, we also track and maintain the identity of the web site you 
        visited immediately prior to visiting our website. We do not otherwise 
        track any information about your use of other websites. <br>
        <br>
        You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you turn 
        off cookies, though, we will not be able to track your order to enable 
        you to purchase from our site. To override your current cookie handling 
        practices for individual sites: Select “Internet Options” 
        from the “Tools” Menu. Click on the “Edit” button 
        in the “Override cookie handling for individual websites” 
        section. This will open the “Per Site Privacy Actions” dialogue 
        box. Type “www.londonfog.com” in the “Address of 
        Website” box. Click the “Allow” button. Click the “OK” 
        button, then close the “Per Site Privacy Actions” dialogue 
        box. Click the “OK” button to close the “Internet Options” 
        dialogue box and apply your changes. <br>
        <br>
        <span><strong>How do I know my order information is secure?</strong></span></p>
      <p>Protecting your order information is important to us. To check the security 
        of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser 
        window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed 
        lock (depending on your browser), your connection is secure. You can also 
        double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing 
        a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change 
        from "http" to "https." <br>
        <br>
        Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication 
        through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at londonfog.com. 
        In that case, you'll be unable to connect to the server, which means you 
        won't be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection.<br>
        <br>
        <span><strong>What about links to other websites and services? </strong></span></p>
      <p>The londonfog.com website may contain links to other sites that 
        are not under our control. These websites have their own policies regarding 
        privacy. You should review those policies before visiting the websites. 
        We have no responsibility for linked websites, and we provide these links 
        solely for the convenience and information of our visitors. </p>
