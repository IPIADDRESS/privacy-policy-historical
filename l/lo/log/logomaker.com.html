			 LogoMaker is owned and   operated by Arteis, Inc. When you're visiting the LogoMaker site, we don't want   you to worry that we will misuse the information you share with us about   yourself. It is important to us that all of our customers understand what   information we gather about them, how we use it, and how we work to protect it.   By using the LogoMaker service and this website, you consent to the information   practices described in this policy. Keep in mind that your use of the LogoMaker   service is also subject to, and controlled by, the LogoMaker Customer Agreement. <br>
			 <br>
			 Information Collection
             <ul>
              <li>Personally Identifiable Information is information that can be used to   locate you, contact you, or determine your specific identity. When other   information is linked to Personally Identifiable Information, it also becomes   Personally Identifiable Information. </li>
              <li>LogoMaker collects Personally Identifiable Information from you in several   ways: <br>
                <br>
                <ol>
                 <li>When you register for the LogoMaker Service, we ask you for basic   registration information, such as your name, company, address, email address,   phone, fax, and other basic contact information ("Registration Information"). </li>

                 <li>When you submit a request for more information or assistance, LogoMaker will   keep a record of the request and the manner in which it was processed ("Customer   Service Information"). </li>
                </ol>
               <br>
              </li>
              <li>In addition to the collection of Personally Identifiable Information, we may   also automatically receive and record information in our server logs from your   browser, including your IP address, your computer's name, the type and version   of your web browser, referrer addresses, and other generally-accepted log   information. We may also record page views (hit counts) and other general   statistical and tracking information. This information will not be not be   associated with your Personally Identifiable Information. </li>
              <li>LogoMaker will use email to communicate with Client. By using the LogoMaker   service you agree to receive status notifications, a monthly newsletter, and   carefully selected special offers and promotions for our services, or for   third-party services LogoMaker believes could be of value to Client. At no time   will you receive more than two special offers a month and you are free to   unsubscribe at anytime by using the unsubscribe link found on each promotional   newsletter, or by emailing support@logomaker.com and requesting to be   unsubscribed.

LogoMaker stores this Information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time   email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact   us at support@logomaker.com to request that we remove this information from our   database. </li>
              <li>While using the LogoMaker reader to access or review a particular design   project ("LogoMaker Reader"), the reader software will record the date and time   that you reviewed the design works. Such information will not be associated with   Personally Identifiable Information ("Reader Information"). </li>
             </ul>
             Limits on Information Collection
             <ul>
              <li>By default, the LogoMaker Reader will record the non-personally identifiable   Reader Information described above. If you do not want LogoMaker to have this   type of information, you may change a setting in the options area of the   LogoMaker Reader and prevent any information from being sent to LogoMaker. </li>
              <li>We must have your Personally Identifiable Information in order for us to   adequately provide you with the LogoMaker service. </li>
              <li>Note that by limiting information collection, LogoMaker may not be able to   provide you the same functionality or features as otherwise available (if such   functionality or features rely on this information). </li>
             </ul>
             Cookies
             <ul>
              <li>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique   identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored   on your computer's hard drive. Each web site can send its own cookies to your   browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy)   most browsers only permit a web site to access the cookies that the same web   site has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. </li>
              <li>LogoMaker may set and access our own cookies on your computer. Information   stored by LogoMaker in cookies may be associated with your Personally   Identifiable Information in order to identify you as a repeat visitor or   customer of the website, to maintain session information for logged in users,   and to track usage trends and patterns in order to better understand and improve   areas of our website. </li>
              <li>LogoMaker may allow other companies or individuals that are presenting   content on our site to set and access their own cookies on your computer. Other   companies' use of cookies is subject to their own respective privacy policies.   We do not have access to any information stored by third party advertisers about   you. </li>
              <li>LogoMaker may allow a third party to use cookies to track your activity on   our website. Such information will not be associated with your Personally   Identifiable Information. </li>
              <li>LogoMaker may also allow a third party to use cookies to allow the use of   the Live Chat feature on the LogoMaker website. Such information will not be   associated with your Personally Identifiable Information. </li>
             </ul>
             Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information <br>
             In general, we will not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to   unaffiliated third parties without your express consent. If we seek your consent   to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to a third party, we will   do so unambiguously, explaining precisely what information we seek to disclose,   the entity to whom we wish to disclose it, and the purpose for the disclosure. <br>
             <br>
             There are, however, some limited circumstances in which we may need to   disclose Personally Identifiable Information about a user, and we want you to   know about them:
             <ul>
              <li>We may employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf, such as   fulfilling orders, providing customer service, sending mail, processing credit   card payments, or other functions necessary to our business. We may need to   share your Personally Identifiable Information to these companies. However, we   will provide them with only that information necessary to perform their   functions, and will not allow them to use that information for any other   purpose. </li>
              <li>Responses to requests for information necessary to provide you with the   products you purchase or subscribe to through the LogoMaker service may contain   Personally Identifiable Information. LogoMaker will provide the authors of such   products the information you supply in response to those requests. The   information practices of those publishers are not covered by this privacy   policy. Your name, address, phone number, and email address, will not be shared   with the Authors. </li>
              <li>We may reveal a user's identity (or whatever information we know about that   individual) if we believe that user is harming or interfering with other   LogoMaker users, anyone else, or violating (either intentionally or   unintentionally) our Customer Agreement or infringing any of LogoMaker's legal   rights. </li>
              <li>LogoMaker will reveal information, including Personally Identifiable   Information, to the extent it reasonably believes it is required to do so by   law. If we receive legal process calling for the disclosure of any of your   personally identifiable information we will, if permitted by law, attempt to   notify you via the e-mail address you supplied during registration within a   reasonable amount of time before we respond to the request. </li>
              <li>LogoMaker may transfer information it collects, including any Personally   Identifiable Information, in connection with a sale of all or most of the assets   of the company. Should your Personally Identifiable Information be transfered as   the result of such sale, you will be notified via email. </li>
             </ul>
             Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Information
             <ul>
              <li>Anonymous Information is any information collected from you or by the   LogoMaker service, other than Personally Identifiable Information, including   aggregate information derived from Personally Identifiable Information. </li>
              <li>LogoMaker may use Anonymous Information to improve the LogoMaker website and   service, to monitor traffic and general usage patterns, and for other general   business purposes. </li>
              <li>LogoMaker may disclose Anonymous Information to third parties for a variety   of business reasons, including to publishers to inform them as to what content   is appealing to their readers, to advertisers to inform them of the usage habits   or characteristics of the interested audience, and to potential investors so   that they may better understand LogoMaker's user base, etc. </li>
              <li>Anonymous Information will not include any Personally Identifiable   Information and LogoMaker will not disclose any Personally Identifiable   Information except as expressly stated elsewhere in this policy. </li>
             </ul>
             Changing or Removing Information
             <ul>
              <li>LogoMaker wants to ensure that you have appropriate control over your   Personally Identifiable Information. You can change your Registration or   Customer Information, by clicking <a href="#">here</a>. </li>
              <li>If at any time you would like to delete your Registration Billing   Information you can send an e-mail request to support@logomaker.com. After   receiving your request, such information will be deleted assuming (i) you are   current with all payment obligations; (ii) LogoMaker does not believe it is   reasonably necessary to keep such information for any pending legal action; and   (iii) we are under no other legal obligation to retain such information. If such   information is deleted, however, any unfulfilled subscriptions will be canceled   without refund and you will have to re-register with LogoMaker in order to use   the LogoMaker service. </li>
              <li>Since Anonymous Information is by its very nature non-personally   identifying, we have no way to locate Anonymous Information obtained by your use   of the service. In addition, Anonymous Information is often aggregated.   Therefore, we cannot remove Anonymous Information obtained from you or as a   result of your usage of the website or service. </li>
             </ul>
             Security
             <ul>
              <li>We employ reasonable and current security methods to prevent unauthorized   access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information. </li>
              <li>Your personal data will be stored within a database that is located behind a   firewall for added security. The server housing the database is physically   protected at a secure, third party site. </li>
              <li>No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be   guaranteed to be secure. As a result, while we try to protect your personal   information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you   transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. </li>
              <li>Any transmission to the LogoMaker website or service of Personally   Identifiable Information and credit card information uses SSL encryption. </li>
             </ul>
             Other Web Sites
             <ul>
              <li>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled   by LogoMaker. Please be aware that we, LogoMaker, are not responsible for the   privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you   leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site   that collects personally identifiable information.

             </ul>
             Changes to this Privacy Policy
             <ul>
              <li>From time to time, LogoMaker may change its privacy policy. If we make any   changes regarding disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to third   parties, then we'll send you an e-mail (or notify you by pop-up screen) prior to   the date the modified policy takes effect. We will also post conspicuous notice   of the new policy on our home page. Any new policy will have prospective effect   only, meaning it will not apply to information previously gathered without your   express consent. </li>
