			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

			<h3>Your privacy is important to us.</h3>
			<p>
				Webyog Softworks Private Limited is committed to protect your privacy. Because we collect two types of user information, General Statistical Information and Personal Identifying Information, we are providing you with this policy to inform you of how we use and, in limited circumstances, disclose such information.
			</p>

			<h3>Collection, Use and Disclosure of General Statistical Information</h3>
			<p>
				When you visit our web site we gather certain general information, such as number of hits on our web site and usage statistics with respect to our software products. This information is referred to throughout this policy as "General Statistical Information". We use and store this data only on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us to determine how and the extent to which certain parts of our web site and software are used. The stored General Statistical Information does not contain any Personal Identifying Information about you or any of our other users.
			</p>
			<h3> Collection and Use of Personal Identifying Information </h3>
			<p>
				In addition to collecting General Statistical Information, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, street address and email address, to enable us to respond to your requests and needs. Information that can reasonably be used to identify you is referred to in this policy as "Personal Identifying Information".
				<br><br>
				For example, if you choose a service or transaction that requires payment, such as making a purchase online or through other means such as a purchase order, we will request Personal Identifying Information necessary for payment, invoicing, and/or shipping.
				<br><br>
				In addition, when you purchase a software product, we will also ask for product registration information, which includes the name of the product acquired, as well as your name, street address, and e-mail address. This Personal Identifying Information is kept on file and updated from time to time to fulfill our continuing obligations to you, such as providing notices of new versions and giving support by e-mail.
				<br><br>
				When you visit our web pages by clicking on a link in our software and choose to purchase a license, we gather certain Personal Identifying Information to facilitate your purchase and usage statistics to analyze, on a collective basis, how and the extent to which certain parts of the our software is used.
				<br><br>
				When you provide us Personal Identifying Information in an e-mail, fax or by telephone such as when you request technical and other types of support, we use the information to locate your records and provide you with answers to your questions.
				<br><br>
				Also, when you submit information to us in the context of a technical support inquiry, including sending the error log files, sample data to reproduce the error, Personal Identifying Information may be attached to the information submitted.
				<br><br>
				Please note that you should be aware that the transmitting of the error logs or sample data or other attachments may include confidential information which should be removed prior to the transmittal as we do not accept responsibility for the inadvertent subsequent disclosure of such confidential information. When you ask to be placed on one of our mailing lists, we will use your e-mail address to send you messages relevant to that list.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Disclosure of Personal Identifying Information</h3>
			<p>
				We may disclose your Personal Identifying Information to appropriate third parties to process transactions you initiate, including shipping products to you and invoicing for purchases made. Examples of such third parties are our order processing and fulfillment service providers and credit card processing companies. We may also disclose your Personal Identifying Information to third parties if we are required to do so by law, or if we believe that such action is necessary to:
				</p><ul>
					<li>Comply with legal processes such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order;</li>
					<li> Protect our rights and property; or</li>
					<li>Protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our web site and/or our software products.</li>
				</ul>
				We never loan, rent or sell your Personal Identifying Information to others.
				<br><br>
			<p></p>
			
			<h3> Cookies</h3>
