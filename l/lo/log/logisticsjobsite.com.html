                    with our partners and advertisers. An example would be where 
                    WorkLife provides partners and advertisers with information 
                    about the percentage of men or women who visit our sites, 
                    or about the types of industries that users come from. WorkLife's 
                    goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, 
                    the user, with the most personalized web experience possible 
                    and our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right 
                    audience. By knowing a little about you, WorkLife is able 
                    to deliver more relevant content and advertisements, and hence 
                    a better service, to you.<br>
