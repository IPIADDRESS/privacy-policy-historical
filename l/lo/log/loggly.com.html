                    <div class="entry">
	                	<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of October 2009.</p>

<p>Loggly, Inc. (“Loggly”, “we” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from users of our log management and analysis service and this website (the “Website”) collected via the Website, email, SMS, telephone, WAP or other means. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason, at our sole discretion. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Website. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.  By using or accessing the Website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy, and  you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of your personally identifiable information, please contact us at [support [at] Loggly.com].</p>

<h3 id="toc-web-services-users-and-web-site-visitors">Web Services Users and Web Site Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most Web services operators, Loggly collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Loggly’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Loggly’s visitors use its website and services. From time to time, Loggly may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website and services.</p>
<p>Loggly also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Loggly does not use such information to identify its visitors and does not disclose such information other than under the circumstances described below.</p>

<h3 id="toc-gathering-of-personally-identifying-information">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

<p>Certain visitors to Loggly’s websites and services choose to interact with Loggly in ways that require Loggly to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Loggly gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask users of the Loggly application to provide a username and email address. In each case, Loggly collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Loggly. Loggly does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain activities.</p>

<h3 id="toc-aggregated-statistics">Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Loggly may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites and service. For instance, Loggly may reveal aggregate data on how much log data an average customer collects, or what the most common search terms used are across all customers. However, Loggly does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h3 id="toc-log-data">Log Data</h3>
<p>Loggly collects, aggregates, and stores log and audit data for its customers.  Loggly in turn will not disclose individual log records other than aggregates as described above or for the purposes described below.</p>
<h3 id="toc-protection-of-certain-personally-identifying-information">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Loggly discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Loggly’s behalf or to provide services available at Loggly’s service, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Loggly’s services, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Loggly will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Loggly discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Loggly believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Loggly, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Loggly service and have supplied your email address, Loggly may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Loggly and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Loggly takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h3 id="toc-cookies">Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Loggly uses cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage of Loggly services, and their preferences. Loggly visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Loggly’s services, with the drawback that certain features of Loggly’s services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h3 id="toc-links-to-other-web-websites">Links to Other Web Websites</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to this Website and not to any third-party sites.</p>
<h3 id="toc-security">Security</h3>
<p>We take precautions to ensure the security of your personal information. However, we cannot guarantee that hackers or unauthorized personnel will not gain access to your personal information despite our efforts. You should note that in using the Website and our related services, your information will travel through third party infrastructures which are not under our control.</p>
<p>We cannot protect, nor does this Privacy Policy apply to, any information that you transmit to other users of the Website. You should never transmit personal or identifying information to other users.</p>
<h3 id="toc-opt-out-policy">Opt-Out Policy</h3>
<p>If, at any time after registering, you change your mind about receiving information from us or about the use of information volunteered by you, please send us a request specifying your new choice. Please contact us as specified above.</p>
<h3 id="toc-privacy-policy-changes">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Loggly may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Loggly’s sole discretion. Loggly encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>	               	</div><!-- /.entry -->
