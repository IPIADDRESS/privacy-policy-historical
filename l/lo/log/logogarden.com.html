<h3>Links to non-LogoGarden.com, Inc. websites</h3>
<p>The LogoGarden.com, Inc. website may provide links to third-party websites for your convenience and information. If you access those links, you will leave the LogoGarden.com website. LogoGarden.com, Inc. does not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from LogoGarden.com, Inc. practices.

For example, when you order products or services, request information, subscribe to marketing or support materials.</p>
<p>In addition to the information you provide, LogoGarden.com, Inc. may also collect information during your visit to an LogoGarden.com website through our Automatic Data Collection Tools, which include Web beacons, cookies, embedded Web links, and other commonly used information-gathering tools. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at an LogoGarden.com, Inc. website. They may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address, clickstream behavior (i.e. the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with LogoGarden.com, Inc. websites) and product information. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers use IP addresses to communicate on the Internet, allowing users to browse and shop. LogoGarden.com, Inc. may also use some of these Automatic Data Collection Tools in connection with certain emails sent from LogoGarden.com, Inc. and therefore may collect information using these tools when you open the email or click on a link contained in the email.</p>
<h3>How we use your information</h3>
<p>The information LogoGarden.com, Inc. collects to understand your needs and interests helps LogoGarden.com, Inc. deliver a consistent and personalized experience. For example, LogoGarden.com, Inc. may use your information to</p>
<ul>
    <li>assist you in completing a transaction or order;</li>
    <li>communicate with you about products and services;</li>
    <li>provide service and support;</li>
    <li>update you on new services and benefits;</li>
    <li>provide personalized promotional offers;</li>

    <li>contact you for market research regarding LogoGarden.com, Inc. products or services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Credit card information is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention.</p>
<h3>How we share your information</h3>
<p>LogoGarden.com, Inc. shares personal information in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>LogoGarden.com, Inc. retains service providers and suppliers to deliver complete products, services and customer solutions and to assist LogoGarden.com, Inc. with marketing and communication initiatives. These providers and suppliers include, for example, credit card processors, providers of customer support and live-help, email service providers, automated data processors, and shipping agents. Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential the information received on behalf of LogoGarden.com, Inc. and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for LogoGarden.com, Inc..</li>
    <li>From time to time, LogoGarden.com, Inc. participates in marketing initiatives with other companies. As part of these initiatives, certain LogoGarden.com, Inc. services, such as printing of business cards, and marketing communications are delivered at the same time as those from other companies. Some of these services and communications offer you the option to share personal information with both LogoGarden.com, Inc. and the other companies participating in these initiatives. For example, you may receive marketing communications from LogoGarden.com, Inc. and other companies or have the opportunity to register online for software products from multiple companies. If you choose to provide personal information only to LogoGarden.com, Inc., LogoGarden.com, Inc. will not share this information with the other companies participating in that marketing initiative. If you choose to provide personal information to the other companies, that personal information will be handled according to the privacy policy of those companies. Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, LogoGarden.com, Inc. decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is LogoGarden.com, Inc.’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.</li>
