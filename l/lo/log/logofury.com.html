    		    <div><strong>Google</strong></div>
    		  
    		    <div>Google's   advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising   Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for   users. <a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en " target="_blank">https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en </a><br>

    		    <div>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</div>
    		    <div><br>
    		      Google,   as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site.   Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users   based on previous visits to our site and other sites on the Internet.   Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google   Ad and Content Network privacy policy.<br>
  		      </div>
    		    <div><br>

    		      <br>
    		    <div><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></div>
    		    <div>CalOPPA   is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and   online services to post a privacy policy.  The law's reach stretches   well beyond California to require any person or company in the United   States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting   Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a   conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the   information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom   it is being shared. -  See more at:   http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br>
  		      </div>
    		    <div><br>
    		      <strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong><br>
  		      </div>
    		    <div>Users can visit our site anonymously.</div>
    		    <div>Once   this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home   page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our   website.<br>
  		      </div>
    		    <div>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</div>
    		    <div><br>
    		      You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</div>
    		    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> On our Privacy Policy Page<br>
  		      </div>
    		    <div>Can change your personal information:</div>
    		    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> By chatting with us or by sending us a support ticket</div>
    		    <div><br>
    		      <strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</strong><br>
  		      </div>
    		    <div>We   don't honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or   use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.   We don't honor them because:<br>
  		      </div>
    		    <div>DNT will affect the website and make it unusable. </div>
    		    <div><br>
    		      <strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong><br>
  		      </div>
    		    <div>It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking</div>
    		    <div><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></div>
    		    <br>
    		    <div>When   it comes to the collection of personal information from children under   the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act   (COPPA) puts parents in control.  The Federal Trade Commission, United   States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which   spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to   protect children's privacy and safety online.<br>
    		      <br>
  		      </div>
    		    <div>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</div>
    		    <br>
    		    <div><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></div>
    		    <div>The   Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law   in the United States and the concepts they include have played a   significant role in the development of data protection laws around the   globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how   they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various   privacy laws that protect personal information.<br>
    		      <br>
  		      </div>
    		    <div><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></div>
    		    <div>We will notify you via email</div>
    		    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Within 7 business days</div>
    		    <div><br>
    		      We   also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that   individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against   data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This   principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights   against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or   government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by   data processors.</div>
    		      <br>
    		    <div><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></div>
    		    <div>The   CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,   establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the   right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out   tough penalties for violations.<br>
    		      <br>
  		      </div>
    		    <div><strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong></div>
    		    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</div>
    		    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</div>
    		    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Send you additional information related to your product and/or service</div>
    		    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.</div>
    		    <div><br>
    		      <strong>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</strong></div>
    		    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</div>
    		    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</div>
    		    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</div>
    		    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</div>
    		    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</div>
    		    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</div>
