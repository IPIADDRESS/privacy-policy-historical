            <h6>1. INTRODUCTION</h6>
            Lodgify is serious about protecting the privacy of our Users. This privacy policy describes how and why we obtain, store and process data which can identify our Users.

            <h6>2. INFORMATION COLLECTION</h6>
            a) The information we collect from our Users is clearly set out on the web page on which we collect it. The information includes but is not limited to name, email address, postal address, billing address, telephone number, username and password.<br>
            b) We also collect the Internet Protocol (IP) address and Cookie information of our Users.<br>
            c) We do not store credit card numbers of our Users. In order to pay for the fees related to our Services we use third party payment processors that will store credit card numbers of our Users.<br>
            d) Users may provide information of their properties that they advertise using our Services. This property information, including but not limited to the property address, is available to the public and can be viewed by any user as it serves to the purpose of advertising the property. The property information may also be sent to our partner websites for the purpose of advertising the property.<br>
            e) We use a third party to gather information about how our Users use our Website.<br>

            <h6>3. INFORMATION USAGE</h6>
            We collect information about our Users in order to promote the Services, customize the Services to the individual needs of our Users, understand and optimize how our Services are used, support and assist our Users in using the Services, improve the Services and contact the Users with important Service updates and to send messages that are integral to the Services. 

            <h6>4. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</h6>
            a) We do not share contact details of our Users with third parties if we do not have the User’s consent to share that information. <br>
            b) We do not sell your personal information to third parties.<br>
            c) We have business partners, including but not limited to tracking companies to analyze the Website visit of our Users for our own statistical use, advertising companies to serve ads when Users visit the Websites and payment processing companies to process payments of our Users. These third parties are authorized to use the personal information of our Users only as necessary to provide these services to us.<br>
            d) In certain circumstances we may need to disclose the personal information of our Users as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process
            when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect the safety of our users or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,
            if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets. We will notify our users via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of personal information
            to any other third party with the User’s prior consent to do so.<br>
            e) Information collected from our Users may be stored and processed in the UK, EU and United States and by using the Services, our Users acknowledge and agree that they may be transferring their personal data outside of the country in which they have contributed it, and that they consent to any such transfer of information outside of their country. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to those that apply in the European Union (EU).<br>

            <h6>5. NEWSLETTER</h6>
            Users will only receive a newsletter from us if we have their consent. Users may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails anytime by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, or unsubscribing within the user account or Users can contact us at support@lodgify.com.

            <h6>6. SECURITY</h6>
            The security of our Users’ personal information is important to us. When our Users enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We take reasonable steps to protect our User’s information. Nevertheless, please note that no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be totally secure. As a result, whilst we strive to protect our User’s information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information which they send to us, and the Users do so at their own risk.

            <h6>7. COOKIES</h6>
            We may use cookies, for example, to keep track of our users’ preferences and profile information. Cookies are also used to collect general usage and volume statistical information that does not include personal information.

            <h6>8. LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</h6>
            Our website includes links to third party websites whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If Users submit personal information to any of those sites, the User information is governed by their privacy statements. 

            <h6>9. INFORMATION ACCESS AND UPDATE</h6>
            If Users request it, users can view and edit the information we have about them at any time.
