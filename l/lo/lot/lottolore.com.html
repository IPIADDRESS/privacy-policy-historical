<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong><br>
<br>
Lotto Lore is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell,
share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this
statement. Lotto Lore collects information from our users at several different points on
our website.<br>
<br>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
<br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about
the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information
while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. If a
user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that
the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track
and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.<br>
<br>
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However,
we have no access to or control over these cookies.<br>
<br>
This site uses the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions
and other marketing messages. To do this, Engage collects anonymous data through the use
of cookies. To learn more about Engage, including your ability to opt out of the Engage
system, go to <a href="http://www.engage.com/privacy">http://www.engage.com/privacy</a><br>
<br>
<strong>Log Files</strong><br>
<br>
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and
gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to
personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Sharing</strong><br>
<br>
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This
is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.<br>
<br>
<strong>Links</strong><br>
<br>
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Lotto Lore, are not
responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be
aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web
site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies
solely to information collected by this Web site.<br>
<br>
<strong>Newsletter</strong><br>
<br>
If a user wishes to subscribe to our lottery numbers by email service, we ask only for an
email address and province. We will only use the email address to send the lottery
results. At any time the user may opt out of this service.<br>
<br>
<strong>Surveys &amp; Contests</strong><br>
<br>
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore
has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may
include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such
as postal code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and
award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the
use and satisfaction of this site.<br>
<br>
<strong>Security</strong><br>
<br>
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit
sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and
off-line.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:info@lottolore.com">info@lottolore.com</a>.<br>
<br>
<strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br>
<br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so
our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under
circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally
identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was
collected, we would notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to
whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information
in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. </p>
