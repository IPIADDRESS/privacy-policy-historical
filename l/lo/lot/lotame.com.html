Please note that Lotame's privacy practices as described below do not apply to the privacy policies or practices of Lotame clients, affiliates, and publishers using Lotame technology. This privacy policy only applies to www.lotame.com and Lotame Crowd Control.
<br>
<br>
Lotame provides online marketing technology to web publishers. Our goal is to help web publishers be more successful by, among other things, providing a more personalized user experience. We do that by helping web publishers learn about what may be of interest to you, so that they can attempt to display more relevant advertising.
<br>
<br>
One of the most important things about us is that the information we collect is anonymous, meaning that Lotame does not intentionally collect any personally identifiable information about you.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>Personal Information.</b> Lotame does not collect personal information. Personal information means data that identifies you personally, such as your name, telephone number, address, or email address.
<br>
<br>
<b>Non-Personal Information.</b> Lotame provides benefits to its clients by collecting anonymous click-stream data whenever you visit a web site that uses Lotame's Crowd Control technology. The information that Lotame collects may include your IP address, the date and time you visited a web site, browser information, and your browsing behavior (that is, the ways in which you interact with the web site).
<br>
<br>
Lotame is a Software Licensor and an Application Service Provider. Our software and technology accepts and integrates the Non-personal information made available to us by our clients, collected pursuant to our clients' privacy policy. We assume that our clients comply with their own privacy policy, and Lotame does not own or make use of our clients' data other than to provide information back to the client. Lotame does not share data with anyone other than the client which owns the data. We may, at times, provide aggregated, anonymous data for measuring purposes and to report industry-wide metrics.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Do we share Information with third parties?</b>
<br>
There are also other limited circumstances in which we share the information we collect with third parties, for example to help us analyze our products, applications and business. These third parties are contractually bound to use the information only in accordance with this privacy policy. They are not authorized to utilize the information in any way other than to provide their services to us.
<br>
<br>
If all or part of Lotame is sold, assigned, transferred or merged, data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the data is maintained in accordance with this privacy policy.
<br>
<br>
Lotame may also release information in special cases in order to comply with any requests from law enforcement and government agencies, and to protect its clients and users. We may do so when we believe in good faith that disclosing information is otherwise necessary or advisable.
<br>
<br>
<span class="monkey">Browser Cookies</span>

Cookies are only used to recognize users anonymously, and do not contain or store any personal information. If you do not want information stored in browser cookies, you may choose to opt-out of this functionality by clicking here. Additionally, many browsers allow you to explicitly block cookies. This is another method of disabling the storage of anonymously collected data.Please refer to your specific browser documentation for instructions on how to perform this task.
