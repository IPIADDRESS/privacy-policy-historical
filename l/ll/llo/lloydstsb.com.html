1.2&nbsp;Please read this Privacy Policy to understand how we use and protect the information that you provide to us through the “Website”.<br>
1.3&nbsp;By accessing any part of this Website or providing any information to us you consent to the use and transfer of your information on the terms set out in this Privacy Policy.<br>
1.4&nbsp;We reserve the right to revise or supplement this Privacy Policy from time to time at our sole discretion and you agree to revisit this page regularly to ensure that you are familiar with the most current version. By continuing to access or use the Website you will be agreeing to any such changes.<br>
1.5&nbsp;If you are a customer of a Lloyds Banking Group company, details of the information we collect and how we use it will also be set out in the terms and conditions of the product or service which you hold. In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the terms and conditions of your specific product or service, the terms and conditions of your specific product or service will take precedence.<br><br><b>2. &nbsp;Information we collect from you</b><br>
2.1&nbsp;In general you can visit this Website without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. However, there are parts of this Website where we may need to collect personal information from you, including without limitation your name, post and email addresses, fax and telephone numbers, employment details, date of birth and banking details.<br><br><b>3.&nbsp;Use of information collected</b><br>
3.1&nbsp;Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Website, pages viewed etc. We use this information to measure the use of our Website and to improve its contents.<br>
3.2&nbsp;When other personal information, such as your name and email address is collected from you (for example through online forms or via email etc) we generally let you know at the time of collection how we will use that personal information. We may also use the personal information you provide or which we collect via this Website for the purposes of:<br>
(i)&nbsp;providing you with services which you have requested and notifying you about important changes or developments to these services;<br>
(ii)&nbsp;updating our records about you;<br>
(iii)&nbsp;crime detection, prevention and prosecution;<br>
(iv)&nbsp;responding to your inquiries and complaints or to process your requests in relation to your information;<br>
(v)&nbsp;administering offers, competitions and other promotions;<br>
(vi) &nbsp;evaluating the effectiveness of our marketing and for research, training and statistical analysis with the aim of improving our services; and<br>
(vii) &nbsp;making the Website easier for you to use and providing you with access to certain parts of the Website.<br>
3.2&nbsp;We may also contact you about products and services available from Lloyds&nbsp;Banking Group companies, and from selected companies outside the group, which we believe may interest you or benefit you financially. We may do this by post or by phone unless you have told us not to; and by email, text or other electronic means if you have told us that we can or as otherwise allowed by law. You may tell us at any time if you change your mind. For more information on your marketing preferences please visit&nbsp;Your marketing preferences.<br>
3.3&nbsp;Lloyds&nbsp;Banking Group companies will treat your personal information as confidential but may share it with each other and disclose it outside the Lloyds&nbsp;Banking Group companies if:&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;you consent;<br>
•&nbsp;it is needed by our agents, advisors or others involved in running accounts and services for you or collecting what you owe Lloyds&nbsp;Banking Group companies;<br>
•&nbsp;HM Revenue &amp; Customs or other authorities require it;<br>
•&nbsp;the law or public interest permits or requires it;<br>
•&nbsp;required by us or others to investigate or prevent crime;<br>
•&nbsp;we need to provide it to a third party in anticipation of or following a sale, merger of the whole or any part of the Lloyds&nbsp;Banking Group companies or in the course of a joint venture. &nbsp;<br>
3.4&nbsp;All countries in the European Economic Area (including the UK) have similar standards of legal protection for your personal information. Lloyds&nbsp;Banking Group companies may run your accounts and provide other services from centres outside the European Economic Area (such as the USA and India) that do not have the same standard of data protection laws as the UK. However, if we do, we will always have a contract in place to ensure that your personal information is protected at least to UK standards, and we will remain bound by our obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998.&nbsp;<br>
3.6&nbsp;We may monitor, record, store and use any telephone, email or other communications we have with you for training purposes, so that we can check any instructions given to us, for crime prevention and to improve the quality of our customer service.<br>

4.2&nbsp;Cookies are used in this Website by us and by third parties to:<br>
•&nbsp;monitor and manage Website traffic;<br>
•&nbsp;evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions (for example, we use a third party ad server – Double Click to manage advertising and to serve adverts on the Website through the use of cookies and pixel tags);<br>
•&nbsp;to identify you when you visit the Website, to personalise the content of the Website for you and to enable you to both carry out transactions and have access to information about your account;<br>
