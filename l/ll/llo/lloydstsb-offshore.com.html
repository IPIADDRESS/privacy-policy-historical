By using your card to make such transactions you give us your explicit consent to process this information.</div></li><li><h2 class="header"><span>Using companies to process your information outside the EEA </span></h2><div>All countries in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the UK, have similar standards of legal protection for your personal information. We may run your accounts and provide other services from centres outside the EEA (such as the USA and India) that do not have a similar standard of data protection laws to the UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man or Gibraltar. If so, we will require your personal information to be protected to at least UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man or Gibraltar standards.  We may process payments through other financial institutions such as banks and the worldwide payments system operated by the SWIFT organisation if, for example, you make a CHAPS payment or a foreign payment. Those external organisations may process and store your personal information abroad and may have to disclose it to foreign authorities to help them in their fight against crime and terrorism. If these are based outside the EEA, your personal information may not be protected to standards similar to those in the UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man or Gibraltar.</div></li><li><h2 class="header"><span>Using credit scoring</span></h2><div><p>When you apply for credit, an automated system known as credit scoring may be used when considering whether to agree the borrowing. It is a method of assessing your likely conduct of an account based on a range of data, including the conduct of previous similar accounts. It is a system widely used by credit providers to help make fair and informed decisions on lending.</p><p>Credit scoring takes account of information from three sources - the information you provide on your application, information provided by credit reference agencies and information that may already be held about you by companies in the Lloyds Banking Group. A credit scoring system will consider information from these sources, to make an overall assessment of your application.</p><p>The credit scoring methods used are regularly tested to ensure they remain fair, effective and unbiased.  Using a credit scoring system helps our Group companies to lend responsibly. If you submit an application and it is declined through this automated process, you can contact us within 21 days to have the decision reconsidered. You also have the right to ask that the decision is not made based solely using a credit scoring system.</p></div></li><li><h2 class="header"><span>How we use Credit Reference Agencies</span></h2><div><p>Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs) collect and maintain information about consumers' and businesses' credit behaviour. This includes Electoral Register, fraud prevention, and credit information - including details of previous applications and the conduct of your accounts - and public information such as County Court judgements, decrees, and bankruptcies.</p><p>The information that Lloyds Banking Group companies and other organisations provide to CRAs about you, your financial associates and your business (if you have one) may be provided to other organisations and used by them and us to:</p><ol type="a"><li>help make decisions, for example when 
        <ol type="i"><li>checking details on applications for credit and credit-related or other facilities;</li><li>managing credit and credit-related accounts or facilities;</li><li>recovering debt;</li><li>checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance; and</li><li>checking details of job applicants and employees;</li></ol>











































&nbsp;</li><li>detect and prevent crime, fraud and money laundering;</li><li>check your credit history;</li><li>verify your identity if you, or someone financially linked with you, applies for services;</li><li>trace your whereabouts; and</li><li>undertake research, statistical analysis and systems testing.</li></ol><p>If a Lloyds Banking Group company needs to make a credit decision when you apply for a credit-based product or service (e.g. mortgage, personal loan, credit card, or current account) or to review the amount of credit it provides under an existing agreement, such as an overdraft, your records will be searched, along with those of anyone who is financially associated with you such as your spouse or partner. The CRA will keep a record of this search and place a "footprint" on your credit file, whether or not the application proceeds.</p><p>We may give details of your account and how you conduct it to CRAs, including if you borrow and do not repay in full and on time. If you fall behind with your payments and a full payment or satisfactory proposals are not received within 28 days of a formal demand being issued, then a default notice may be recorded with the CRAs. Similar information may also be given about your other lending/credit relationships with members of our Group. Any records shared with CRAs will remain on file for 6 years after your account is closed, whether it has been settled by you or as a result of a default. Other organisations may see these searches and updates if you apply for credit in the future, and these may affect your ability to borrow from other lenders.</p><p>If you apply for or hold an account in joint names, or tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, a financial association will be created between your records, including any previous and subsequent names used by you. This means that your financial affairs may be treated as affecting each other. These links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your spouse or financial associate is successful in applying for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link. You must be sure that you have their agreement to disclose information about them. Searches may be made on all joint applicants, and search footprints will be left on all applicants’ records.</p><p>You have a right to apply to the CRAs for a copy of your file.</p><p>We carry out most of our credit searches using Experian, but details of how you have run your account(s) may be disclosed to all CRAs. The information they hold may not be the same and there is a small fee that you may need to pay to each agency that you apply to.  The addresses for the CRAs used in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man are detailed below, or, if you are resident elsewhere, please contact us.</p><p>For Channel Islands and Isle of Man their addresses are:</p><ul><li>Experian Consumer Help Service, PO Box 9000, Nottingham NG80 7WP or call 0344 481 8000 or log on to <a href="http://www.experian.co.uk" title="www.experian.co.uk" target="_blank">www.experian.co.uk</a></li><li>Equifax plc, Credit File Advice Centre, PO Box 1140, Bradford BD1 5US or log on to <a href="https://www.equifax.co.uk/" title="www.equifax.co.uk" target="_blank">www.equifax.co.uk</a></li><li>CallCredit, Consumer Services Team, PO Box 491, Leeds LS3 1WZ or call 0870 060 1414 or log on to <a href="http://www.callcredit.co.uk" title="www.callcredit.co.uk" target="_blank">www.callcredit.co.uk</a></li></ul><p>For Jersey and Guernsey we may also use the following:</p><ul><li>Integricheck Limited, 3 Le Clos Des Blanches, St Clement, Jersey, JE2 6PB.

</li></ul></div></li><li><h2 class="header"><span>Using Fraud Prevention Agencies</span></h2><div><p>We have systems that protect our customers and ourselves against fraud and other crime. Customer information can be used to prevent crime and trace those responsible. We will share your personal information from your application with fraud prevention agencies. If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details of this fraud will be passed to these agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example, when:</p><ul><li>checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities;</li><li>managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities;</li><li>recovering debt;</li><li>checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance; and</li><li>checking details of job applicants and employees.</li></ul><p>Please contact us on <strong>0345 602 7174</strong> if you want to receive details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies. We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.</p></div></li><li><h2 class="header"><span>How we check your identity </span></h2><div>We may ask you to provide physical forms of identity verification when you open your account.  Alternatively, we may search CRA files in assessing your application.  The agency also gives us other details and information from the Electoral Register to verify your identity.  The agency keeps a record of our search, whether or not your application proceeds.  Our search is not seen or used by lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit.</div></li><li><h2 class="header"><span>Undertaking Anti-Money Laundering checks </span></h2><div>To comply with money laundering regulations, there are times when we need to confirm (or reconfirm) the name and address of our customers. This information may be shared with other Lloyds Banking Group companies. For more details about identity checks, please contact us.</div></li><li><h2 class="header"><span>Credit searching directors </span></h2><div>The Data Protection Regulations do not generally apply to companies but they do cover personal data relating to sole traders and partnerships. When we receive an application from a business we may perform a search with a CRA on the individual company directors or partners, or any guarantors.</div></li><li><h2 class="header"><span>Obtaining information about you, and other personal details</span></h2><div>When you apply for a mortgage or further borrowing it may be necessary to obtain references, details of your existing financial commitments, and any other information that is required to assess or review lending risks, to recover debts, and to prevent or detect fraud. Where applicable, your current and previous employers, accountant, landlord, lender, bank, insurance or pension company may be contacted to obtain this information. In limited circumstances these references may need to be obtained after you open your account. This may be for regulatory purposes, or if the lending decision needs to be reviewed. Your permission to obtain these references will therefore continue to apply after your account has been opened. It may also be necessary to obtain information or documentation from your solicitor relating to any work they carry out either on your or our behalf.</div></li><li><h2 class="header"><span>Using your details for service contact </span></h2><div><p>Making sure we deliver excellent customer service is very important to us and to do this various methods of communication may be used when sending you information about your account. Most of the time you will be contacted by letter or telephone, but you may also be sent updates by text message (where that service is available) or email when it is believed to be appropriate.  You can ask us to stop sending these messages at any time. Additionally, in extraordinary circumstances (such as natural disaster or civil unrest) we may also send you updates by text message (where that service is available) or email. If we decide to use email to contact you, we will only do this if we have ensured that using email will not put your information at risk, or, if you have requested we email you, that we have explained the risks of sending an "insecure" email and that you are happy to accept that risk.</p><p>In addition you may wish to choose a channel of communication that suits you when you need to contact us.   If you need to email a Lloyds Banking Group company, we recommend you check their website to see if a secure email facility exists so that your email can be sent securely.  If you send us emails in other ways, such as from your personal account, then remember that the message may not be secure and there is a risk that it could be intercepted.  If you choose to send an "insecure" email, please keep the amount of confidential information you include to a minimum.</p></div></li><li><h2 class="header"><span>Recording phone calls </span></h2><div>We may monitor or record phone calls with you in case we need to check we have carried out your instructions correctly, to resolve queries or issues, for regulatory purposes, to help improve our quality of service, and to help detect or prevent fraud or other crimes.  Conversations may also be monitored for staff training purposes.</div></li><li><h2 class="header"><span>Using information on social networking sites </span></h2><div>As part of our ongoing commitment to understanding our customers better, we may research comments and opinions made public on social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook.</div></li><li><h2 class="header"><span>Obtaining a copy of your information</span></h2><div><p>Under the Data Protection Regulations you have the right of access to your personal data. The Data Protection Regulations allow us to charge a fee of £10 for this service. If anything is inaccurate or incorrect, please let us know and we will correct it. For further details on how to request a copy of your information, please contact:</p><ul><li>For Gibraltar: Royal Ocean Plaza, Ocean Village, Gibraltar GX11 1AA</li><li>For Guernsey: PO Box 53, 1 Smith Street, St Peter Port, Guernsey, GY1 4BD</li><li>For Isle of Man: PO Box 111, Peveril Buildings, Peveril Square, Douglas, Isle of Man IM99 1JJ</li><li>For Jersey: PO Box 160, 25 New Street, St. Helier, Jersey JE4 8RG.</li></ul></div></li><li><h2 class="header"><span>Using your personal information to contact you about products and services</span></h2><div><p>Unless you have asked us not to, we and other Lloyds Banking Group companies may contact you by mail, telephone, email or text message (where that service is available) about products and services available from the Group. In addition we may also contact you about products and services from selected companies outside the Group, which we believe may be of interest to you or benefit you financially.</p><p>We promise not to contact you about everything - only if we think it could be appropriate and relevant to you, such as preferential savings opportunities, account upgrades or special offers. This contact may continue after your relationship with us ends. You may opt out of receiving this information at any time by calling us, writing to us or contacting your local branch.</p></div></li><li><h2 class="header"><span>Passing your information to other companies for their own direct marketing</span></h2><div>Unless you have given us your consent, we will not provide information about you to companies outside our Group to use for their own marketing purposes.</div></li><li><h2 class="header"><span>Using cookies</span></h2><div><p>In general, you can visit Lloyds Banking Group websites without identifying who you are or revealing any information about yourself.
