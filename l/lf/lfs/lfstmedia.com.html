        <div id="regular">
    
            <p>LifeStreetMedia.com  (the "Website") is an Internet property of LifeStreet ("us"  or "we"). We provide this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy) so  that we may inform you about how our technology ("Technology") processes  information on behalf of the online advertisers, website owners and other  businesses that use our services. You agree to this Privacy Policy, in its  entirety, when you: (1) access or use the Website; and/or (2) apply for any  information or services available through the Website ("Services").  If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy, please  do not use or access the Website or apply for the Services.</p>
            
            <h4>Personally  Identifiable Information:</h4>
            
            <p>We collect Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") from this  Website when you attempt to become a Client or otherwise choose to provide PII  to us.

            <p>LifeStreet may also use personal information for any marketing and survey  purpose on behalf of itself and its affiliates and subsidiaries. We may  disclose personal information to third party agents and independent contractors  that help us conduct our marketing and survey efforts. Further, we may disclose  personal information to other companies in connection with marketing efforts  including but not limited to direct marketing, which may have no relationship  to LifeStreet. Finally, if LifeStreet or any of its assets are acquired by or  merged with another entity, member information will be one of the transferred  assets.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, we will use or disclose your personal information under the  following circumstances: (1) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal  process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal  claims; (2) in the event you violate or breach an agreement with us; (3) we  believe you will harm the property or rights of LifeStreet or those of  LifeStreetâ€™s other customers, (4) we believe it is necessary to share  information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal  activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the  physical safety of any person, violations of LifeStreet 's terms of use, or as  otherwise required by law, or (5) personal information may also be shared with  or sold to any successor to, or purchaser of, part or all of the assets of  LifeStreet.</p>
            
            <h4>Non-Personally  Identifiable Information:</h4>
            
            <p>We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII") from  Website visitors. Non-PII is information that cannot by itself be used to  identify a particular person or entity, and may include your IP host address,  pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet  Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your visit to our Website, the referring  URL and/or your computer's operating system.</p>
            
            <h4>Cookies and  Web Beacons:</h4>
            
            <p>We use "cookies" and web beacons to help us manage our Website.  Cookies are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters.  Web beacons (also known as "1X1 pixels" or "clear GIFs")  are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image  on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. Web  users have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing a setting in  their browser. Web users can check their browser supplier's website for details  on how to do this.

            <p>We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on  the Sites.

This information may include the URL that you just came  from (whether this URL is on the Sites or not), which URL you next go to  (whether this URL is on the Sites or not), your computer browser information,  and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique  Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your Internet Service  Provider ("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or  cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular  computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting  information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not  identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be  used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can,  however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you  are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may  collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.</p>
