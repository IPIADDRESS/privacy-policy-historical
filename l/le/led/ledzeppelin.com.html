  <div class="content">
    <p>Led-Zeppelin.com ("Company," "we,"  "us"), is concerned about online privacy issues and wants you to be  familiar with how we collect, use and disclose your Personally Identifiable  Information (as defined below). This Privacy Policy (the "Policy")  describes our practices in connection with Personally Identifiable Information  that we collect through<strong> LedZeppelin.com</strong> (the "Site"). This  Policy does not govern our collection of information through any web site, or  by any other means, other than through the Site; nor does this Policy govern  the collection of information by third parties, including our Partners.</p>
<p>   By using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions  of this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy,  please do not use the Site. We reserve the right to change this Policy without  prior notice. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring  to the "<em>LAST UPDATED</em>" legend at the top of this page. Any  changes to our Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised  Policy on the Site. Use of the Site following such changes constitutes your  acceptance of the revised Policy then in effect.</p>
<p>   The Site is controlled and operated by Company from the  United States, and is not intended to subject Company or any Affiliated Entity  to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that  of the United States. Company does not represent or warrant that the Site, or  any part thereof, is appropriate or available for use in any particular  jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Site do so on their own initiative  and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws,  rules and regulations. You are also subject to United States export controls in  connection with your use of the Site and/or Site-related services, and are  responsible for any violations of such controls, including without limitation  any United States embargoes or other federal rules and regulations restricting  exports. We may limit the Site's availability, in whole or in part, to any  person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and in our sole  discretion. By using the Site and submitting any Personally Identifiable  Information, visitors from outside of the United States acknowledge that the  Site is subject to United States law and consent to the transfer of Personally  Identifiable Information to the United States, which may provide a different  level of data security than in their country of residence, and waive any claims  that may arise under their own national laws. </p>
<p><strong>Note Regarding the Use of the Site by Children:</strong> The Site is not directed  to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such  individuals do not provide Personally Identifiable Information through the  Site. </p>
<p>1. What Types of Information Does Company Collect From  Me? </p>
<p>Company gathers two basic types of information through  the Site: "<strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>" (or "<strong>PII</strong>")  and "<strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>" (or "<strong><em>Non-PII</em></strong>").  Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies you as an  individual; that is, your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail  address, credit card number or other payment account number. Non-Personally  Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic information, IP  addresses and any other information that does not reveal your specific  identity. </p>
<p><strong>a. Personally Identifiable Information</strong>. You do not have to  provide PII to use the Site. However, in order for you to take advantage of  particular opportunities provided through the Site (for example, to sign up for  a newsletter or to view certain areas of the Site), we may require that you  furnish PII. We collect PII from you through the Site only when you voluntarily  provide it to us. </p>
<p><strong>b. Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> When you visit and  interact with the Site, Company and third parties with whom Company has  contracted to provide services to Company may collect Non-PII (for example, a  catalog of the Site pages you visit). Non-PII is generally collected through  the Site from five different sources: server log files, environmental  variables, cookies, pixel tags and other similar technologies and information  that you voluntarily provide. </p>
<p>°<strong>i. Server Log Files. </strong>Your Internet Protocol (IP)  address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are  using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and  logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along  with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. We use your  IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating  Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site's servers, and  administering the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the  Internet and is done automatically by many web sites. </p>
<p>°<strong>ii. Environmental Variables.</strong> We and our service  providers may also collect certain environmental variables, such as your MAC  address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version,  Internet browser, and Internet browser version. These environmental variables  are collected by most browsers, and can be used to optimize your experience on  the Site. </p>
<p>°<strong>iii. Cookies</strong>. We and our service providers may  use "cookies" on the Site. Cookies are data that a web server  transfers to an individual's computer for recordkeeping purposes. Cookies are  an industry standard used by most web sites, and can facilitate users' ongoing  access to and use of a particular web site; cookies do not cause damage to your  computer systems or files. If you do not want information collected through the  use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to  automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or  accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular web  site, to your computer. </p>
<p>°<strong>iv. Pixel Tags.</strong> We and our service providers may  also use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear  GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "<strong>Pixel Tags</strong>") in  connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among  other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates.  A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is  ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with Cookies on  the visitors' hard drives. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited  certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help determine  the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in  HTML-formatted e-mail messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when  the e-mail has been opened. </p>
<p>°<strong>v. Information That You Voluntarily Provide. </strong>Company  also collects Non-PII (e.g., your interests, your geographic location, etc.)  when you voluntarily provide such information to us. When such information is  not combined with any PII, such information is considered to be Non-PII, as it  does not personally identify you or any other user. Additionally, we may  aggregate PII in a manner such that the end-product does not personally  identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using PII to  calculate the percentage of our users who like a particular artist. Such aggregate  information is considered Non-PII for purposes of this Policy. </p>
<p>2. How Does Company Use Information Collected From Me? </p>
<p><strong>a. Personally Identifiable Information. </strong>We may use your PII in  the following ways: </p>
<p><strong>i. Fulfillment of Requests.</strong> Company may use your PII to fulfill the  purpose for which such PII was provided (e.g., to send newsletters to you or  fulfill your purchase). </p>
<p><strong>ii. Administrative Communications. </strong>From time to time, in our  sole discretion, we may use your PII to send to you important information  regarding the Site, or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because  this information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out  of receiving such communications. </p>
<p><strong>iii. Other Communications. </strong>If you affirmatively opt-in, Company and  the Affiliated Entities may use your PII to inform you of products, programs,  services and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. If you would  prefer not to receive marketing-related e-mail messages, please refer to  Section 3.e (<em>"Opt-Out"</em>) below. </p>
<p><strong>iv. Third Party Communications.</strong> If you affirmatively opt-in, we may share  your PII with third parties to allow them to contact you regarding products,  programs, services and promotions that they believe may be of interest to you.  If you would like to later opt-out of receiving marketing-related e-mail  messages from such third parties, please utilize any opt-out mechanisms set  forth in such third parties' marketing-related e-mail messages and/or privacy  policies. </p>
<p><strong>v. Disclosures to Partners.</strong> One of the reasons we operate the Site is  to provide you with news and information about LedZeppelin. As such, if you  affirmatively opt-in, we may share your PII with our partners, such as record  label partners, (collectively, “<strong>Partner(s)</strong>”) so that such Partners have  information on users of the Site, and such Partners may use this information to  contact you regarding products, programs, services and promotions that such Partners  believe may be of interest to you. Although we seek to have Partners agree to  abide by this Policy, we do not control, and are not responsible for, Partners'  use of your PII. If you would prefer not to receive marketing-related e-mail  messages from Partner(s), please see the <em>"Opt-Out"</em> section  below. </p>
<p>°<strong>vi. Purchases.</strong> When you make a purchase through  the Site, we may collect your credit card number or other payment account  number (for example, your wireless account number), billing address and other  information related to such purchase (collectively, "<strong>Payment  Information</strong>") from you, and may use such Payment Information in order  to fulfill your purchase. We may also provide such Payment Information, or  other PII provided by you, to third parties as necessary to complete your  purchase (for example, to process your credit card or payment account number).  To the extent that Payment Information includes Non-PII, use of such Non-PII is  governed by Section 2.b below. </p>
<p><strong>vii. E-mails to Friends. </strong>We may provide functionality to permit you  to send messages regarding Site-related content (such as music clips or artist  information) to a friend through the Site. If you wish to use this feature, you  may provide us with your friend's e-mail address so that we can facilitate your  sending of such message to your friend. To do so, any PII you provide in  connection with sending your friend such message, such as your name and your  e-mail address, will, of course, be disclosed to your friend. </p>
<p><strong>viii. Promotions</strong>. Company or Partner(s) may operate  sweepstakes, contests and other promotions (collectively, "<strong>Promotions</strong>")  through the Site. We typically ask you for certain PII when you enter and, if  applicable, win a Promotion. We reserve the right to share this PII with third  parties sponsors of such Promotions (irrespective of whether such Promotions  are hosted by us), or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to such  Promotion. You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in  which you participate through the Site, as they may contain additional  important information about Company's, a sponsor's or other third parties' use  of your PII. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules  concerning the treatment of your PII conflict with this Policy, the terms and  conditions of such rules shall control. </p>
<p><strong>ix. Internal Business Purposes.</strong> We may also use your PII for our internal  business purposes, such as data analysis, audits and so forth. </p>
<p><strong>x. Third Party Service Providers. </strong>We work with third  parties who provide services including but not limited to data analysis, order  fulfillment and other services of an administrative nature. We reserve the  right to share your PII with such third parties for the purpose of enabling  these third parties to provide such services (for example, if you choose to buy  wireless products or services from us, we may share your personally  identifiable information with your wireless carrier and our third party service  providers so that such products and/or services can be delivered to you and/or  your mobile device). </p>
<p><strong>xi. Assignment</strong>. We reserve the right to transfer any and all  information that we collect from Site users to a third party in the event of  any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other  disposition of all or any portion of Company's business, assets or stock (including  without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).  Additionally, please note that if any Partner is no longer affiliated with  Company, we may transfer or provide a copy of any and all information that we  collect from Site users to such Partner. </p>
<p><strong>xii. Law enforcement; emergencies; compliance. </strong>Notwithstanding any other  provision of this Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose your  PII to others as we believe to be appropriate (a) under applicable law; (b) to  comply with legal process (c) to respond to governmental requests; (d) to  enforce our Terms and Conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those or our  Partners; (f) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Company,  our Partners, you or others; and (g) to permit us to pursue available remedies  or limit the damages that we may sustain. For example, we may, to the fullest  extent the law allows, disclose PII about you to law enforcement agencies to  assist them in identifying individuals who have been or may be engaged in  unlawful activities. </p>
<p><strong>b. Non-Personally Identifiable Information. </strong>Because Non-PII does not  personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose. In  addition, we reserve the right to share such Non-PII, which does not personally  identify you, with&nbsp; third parties, for  any purpose. </p>
<p>In some instances, we may combine Non-PII with PII (such  as embedding e-mail addresses in cookies). If we do combine any Non-PII with  PII, the combined information will be treated by us as PII hereunder as long as  it is so combined (see Section 2.a above). </p>
<p>3. Other Important Notices Regarding Our Privacy  Practices. </p>
<p><strong>a. Profiles</strong>. We may provide functionality on the Site that allows  you to create a "profile page" (your "<strong>Profile</strong>") and post  certain information and materials on your Profile. Please note that your  Profile, including all PII available in your Profile, may be accessible to  other users. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to  disclose your PII, or any other information, in your Profile. WE ARE NOT  RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF ANY PII YOU DISCLOSE IN YOUR PROFILE. </p>
<p><strong>b. Information Posted by Visitors. </strong>Company may make  available through the Site services (for example, message boards, chat  functionality and blogs, among other services) to which you are able to post  information and materials. Please note that any information you disclose  through such services or otherwise on the Site becomes public information, and  may be available to visitors to the Site and to the general public. In  addition, when you choose to make a posting on such services, certain PII (for  example, a link to your Profile that contains PII), will be available for other  users to view. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to  disclose your PII, or any other information, on the Site. WE ARE NOT  RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF ANY PII YOU VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THROUGH THE SITE. </p>
<p><strong>c. Third Party Sites.</strong> The Site may contain links to third party  web sites. These linked sites are not under Company's control and we are not  responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such linked site,  or any link contained in any linked site. We provide such links only as a  convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement  of the linked site by Company or Partner(s). If you provide any PII through any  such third party web site, your transaction will occur on such third party's  web site (not the Site) and the PII you provide will be collected by, and  controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. We recommend that you  familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any such third  parties. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD  PARTIES</p>
<p>   <strong>d. Third Party Advertisers. </strong>We may use third-party advertising  companies to serve ads when you visit our Site. Please note that these  companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address  or telephone number) about your visit to this Site in order to provide  advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the  course of serving advertisements to this Site, these companies may place or  recognize a unique cookie on your browser. If you would like more information  about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information  used by these companies, please visit <br>   <strong><a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy" target="_blank">www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy</a></strong> or <strong><a href="http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>e. Security</strong>. We use reasonable organizational, technical and  administrative measures to protect PII under our control. Security measures and  tools, such as firewalls, are in place to help protect against the loss, misuse  and alteration of the information under our control. Unfortunately, no data  transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be  100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect your PII, we cannot  ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us through or  in connection with the Site or that is stored by us. We also seek to strike a  balance between the security of your data and your convenience. We do this  because we believe that our customers attach value to both. As a result, we  will often use a method of communication that is less secure than other, less  convenient alternatives. For example, certain data you send us, including PII,  may be sent to us in unencrypted form. You acknowledge and agree that any  information you transmit through the Site is so transmitted at your own risk.  If you are concerned that your PII may be transmitted over the Internet in  unencrypted form, please do not provide us with any PII. If you have reason to  believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you  feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been  compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in  accordance with Section 3.f ("<em>Contacting Us,</em>") below (note  that if you choose to notify us via physical mail, this will delay the time it  takes for us to respond to the problem). </p>
<p><strong>f. Opt-Out. </strong>If you would prefer not to receive marketing-related  e-mail messages from Company, you may opt-out of receiving such messages by  following the "unsubscribe" instructions in the latest such message  you have received from Company. Please note that following such "unsubscribe"  instructions will opt you out of receiving marketing-related e-mail messages  from the sender of the particular message from which you initiated the opt-out  process, but will not opt you out of receiving such messages from other senders  (including, as applicable, Company or Partner(s)). </p>
<p>Additionally, if you would like to opt-out of receiving  marketing-related e-mail messages from Partner(s) or other third parties with  whom we have shared your PII hereunder, please utilize any opt-out mechanisms  set forth in such third parties' or Partner(s) marketing-related e-mail  messages and/or privacy policies, if any. </p>
<p><strong>g. Contacting Us.</strong> If you have any questions regarding this  Policy, please contact us by e-mail at <strong>webmaster@ledzeppelin.com </strong>or please  write to the following address:</p>
<p>   Joan Hudson &amp; Co  Limited<br>   91, Tabernacle Street<br>   London<br>   EC2A 4JN</p>
<p>Please note that e-mail communications will not  necessarily be secure; accordingly you should not include credit card  information or other sensitive information in your e-mail correspondence with  us. </p>
