<h1>LetPub Privacy Policy</h1>

<div id="content">

<p><strong>Last Updated on May 25, 2018.</strong> This Privacy Policy is effective  immediately for users that sign up for LetPub accounts on or after <strong>May 25,  2018</strong> and will become effective on May 25, 2018 for users that already have LetPub  accounts. </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the  collection, use, and disclosure of information about you in connection with  your use of our services, including those offered through our websites, emails,  and mobile applications (collectively, the <strong>"Service"</strong>). The  terms <strong>"we"</strong>, <strong>"us"</strong>, and <strong>"LetPub"</strong> refer to Accdon LLC, a Massachusetts corporation with its headquarters in Waltham,  MA. When you use the Service, you consent to our collection, use, and  disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>I. Information We Collect and How We  Use It </strong></p>
<p>We may collect and store information about you in connection  with your use of the Service, including any information you transmit to or  through the Service. We use that information to provide the Service’s  functionality, fulfill your requests, improve the Service’s quality, engage in  research and analysis relating to the Service, personalize your experience,  track usage of the Service, provide feedback to third party businesses that are  listed on the Service, display relevant advertising, market the Service,  provide customer support, message you, back up our systems, allow for disaster  recovery, enhance the security of the Service, and comply with legal  obligations. Even when we do not retain such information, it still must be  transmitted to our servers initially and stored long enough to process. </p>
<p>Please also note:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you create a LetPub account,       we may store and use the information you provide during that process, such       as your full name, email address, zip code, physical address, and other       information you may provide with your account. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Transactions:</strong> If you initiate a transaction       through the Service, such as a purchase, we may collect and store       information about you, such as your name, phone number, address, email,       and payment information (such as a credit card number and expiration       date), as well as any other information you provide to us, in order to       process your transaction, send communications about them to you, and       populate forms for future transactions. When you submit credit card       numbers, we encrypt that information using industry standard technology.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Activity:</strong> We may store information about your use of the       Service, such as your search activity, the pages you view, the date and       time of your visit. We also may store information that your computer or       mobile device may provide to us in connection with your use of the       Service, such as your browser type, type of computer or mobile device,       browser language, IP address, WiFi information such as SSID, mobile       carrier, phone number, unique device identifier, advertising identifier,       location (including geolocation, beacon based location, and GPS location),       and requested and referring URLs. We may also receive and store your       location whenever our mobile applications are running, including when       running in the background, if you enable our mobile apps to access such       information in the course of using the Service. You may be able to limit       or disallow our use of certain location data through your device or       browser settings, for example by adjusting the "Location       Services" settings for our applications in iOS privacy settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the use of our paid services (English Editing,  Translation, and other services) you have to set up an account. Your customer  account retains your personal data in order to communicate with you during a  submission, re-edits, and follow-ups. This processing is based on Article 6  sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. b.] By statutory law we are required to retain the provided  financial data in relation to transactions (including address, payment and  order information) for 10 years. Regarding this, the retention of your personal  data is based on Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. c GDPR.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Different Devices:</strong> You may access the Service       through different devices (e.g., your mobile phone or desktop computer)       and different platforms (e.g., the LetPub website or LetPub mobile app).       The information that we collect and store through those different uses may       be cross-referenced and combined.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Newsletter and Marketing E-mail       Communications: </strong>With       your email address you can subscribe to our newsletter and marketing       e-mail communications that provide you with the latest news about our       products and services if you consent to receiving such newsletters. This       also includes special offers and exclusive discounts. Your email address       will be retained as long as you subscribe to marketing emails. Regardless       of your country, you can unsubscribe from newsletters and marketing emails       by opting out via the link provided in each newsletter or marketing email.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data retention: </strong>We       strive to keep our processing activities with respect to your personal       data as limited as possible. In the absence of specific retention periods       set out in this policy, your personal data will be retained only for as       long as we need it to fulfill the purpose for which we have collected it       and, if applicable, as long as required by statutory retention       requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use such information only to assist us in providing an  effective service (e.g. to adapt our website to the needs of your device or to  allow you to log in to our website), and to collect broad demographic  information for anonymised, aggregated use. The personal data automatically  collected is necessary for us to provide the website, Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1  lit. b GDPR, and for our legitimate interest to guarantee the website’s  stability and security, Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>

  We, and third parties with whom we partner, may use cookies,  web beacons, tags, scripts, local shared objects such as HTML5 and Flash  (sometimes called "flash cookies"), advertising identifiers (including  mobile identifiers such as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s Advertising ID) and similar  technology (<strong>"Cookies"</strong>) in connection with your use of the  Service, third party websites, and mobile applications. Cookies may have unique  identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your computer or mobile device,  in emails we send to you, and on our web pages. Cookies may transmit  information about you and your use of the Service, such as your browser type,  search preferences, IP address, data relating to advertisements that have been  displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your  use.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Processes</p></td>
    <td><p>Intended to make the Service work in    the way you expect. For example, we use a Cookie that tells us whether you    have already signed up for an account.</p></td>

    <td><p>Authentication, Security, and    Compliance</p></td>
    <td><p>Intended to prevent fraud, protect    your data from unauthorized parties, and comply with legal requirements. For    example, we use Cookies to determine if you are logged in.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Notifications</p></td>
    <td><p>Intended to allow or prevent notices    of information or options that we think could improve your use of the    Service. For example, we use a Cookie that stops us from showing you the    signup notification if you have already seen it.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Analytics</p></td>
    <td><p>Intended to help us understand how    visitors use the Service. For example, we use a Cookie that tells us how our    search suggestions correlate to your interactions with the search page.</p></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>You can set some Cookie preferences through your device or  browser settings, but doing so may affect the functionality of the Service. The  method for disabling Cookies may vary by device and browser, but can usually be  found in your device or browser preferences or security settings.
