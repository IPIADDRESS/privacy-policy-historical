                                    <p><strong>Effective Date: Jan. 1, 2007.</strong><br>
                                      LETTER-SAMPLES.COM has a firm commitment to privacy. We take your  privacy concerns seriously and want to make every effort to address  them as we strive to offer our site visitors a high quality,  interactive and personalized experience. That is why we have adopted  the following policy, which explains our position on information  gathering and how we intend to use and share any information we  collect. It is important to note that this policy applies only to  information collected by LETTER-SAMPLES.COM <br>
  <br>
                                      LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  collects and stores Personally Identifiable Information such as your  name, address, e-mail address, etc. What information we collect and  store depends on the page you are visiting and the services you elect  to participate in. We use this information to operate our services,  provide you with the highest quality services, offer you opportunities  we think will be of interest, and better tailor the advertising you see  from us to suit you. This information is not shared with anyone except  as provided for in this Privacy Policy. More specifics on the  information we collect are outlined within this policy.<br>
  <br>
                                      This privacy policy is subject to change from time to time. If the  policy is revised, a notice will be placed in the Member Center where  registered members of our service may also update their personal  information, subscribe to e-mail newsletters and revise the permissions  that they previously granted LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  . They may also receive an e-mail outlining the change. Non-registered  users of LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  may view the privacy policy, including any revisions, by clicking on  the "Privacy Policy" link on the home page of LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  . If the changes represent a material departure from our current policy  or materially affect users' rights and obligations, if feasible, the  changes will be posted on this page 30 days in advance of their  effective date.<br>
  <strong><br>
    What information we collect and how it is used</strong><br>
                                      Access to special content, services and features on LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  requires users to be registered members at LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  . Member registration requires you to provide certain Personally  Identifiable Information, such as your name, e-mail address, street  address, gender, and date of birth. You will be asked to select a  membername and password so that you have access to this information and  can revise it in the future. To complete the registration process, we  will send you a validation e-mail message. You must click the link in  the e-mail to fully activate your membership account. You will also  have the opportunity to subscribe to e-mail newsletters and alerts and  elect to receive E-mail Offers sent to you on behalf of  LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  advertisers. Some features and services may require additional  Personally Identifiable Information or other demographic information.  We may collect other personal information when you provide feedback,  comments, engage in chat, message boards, interactive forums or  participate in surveys, or if you contact us offline. For example, when  you enter contests you will be asked to also provide your phone number  so that we can reach you in the event you've won a prize. All users may  decline to share such information with us, by choosing not to register  on the web site or use our services. Only registered members, however,  may access certain content, services and features.<br>
  <br>
                                      You may also be asked to create a separate registration account with  some of the services provided by partners and other providers on  LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  .&nbsp; Be aware that the information collected by a provider may be subject  to the privacy policy and terms of use of that provider, and we  recommend reviewing these prior to submitting your registration.<br>
  <br>
                                      If you wish to forward an article to a friend, we will ask that you  provide your friend's name and e-mail address. While we may collect  statistics on which articles are forwarded, we do not sell, rent, or  market your friend's personal information, and retain the information  only as long as necessary to provide this service.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Passive Data Collection and Use</strong><br>
                                      Like most Web sites, LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  also collects and logs information automatically and through the use of  electronic tools that may be transparent to you, such as your IP  address, the name and location of your Internet Service Provider,  the type and version of your browser, the length of time that you stay  on LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  , search queries, your click-stream data, the location that referred  you to LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  and the average number of pages viewed. If you visit another website  prior to browsing LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  , that website might place personally identifiable information within a  URL, which may be logged by us. Your IP address is the identifier  assigned to your particular computer when you access the Internet. Depending on how you connect to the  Internet, your IP address may always be the same, or it may change each  time you access the Internet. Note that logging your IP address does  not in and of itself provide us with your name, e-mail address or home  or work address. We use this log information for systems administration  and troubleshooting purposes and may also use it to gather general  demographic information about you such as your general location and  your Internet Service Provider. In order to better provide our services to you and to  develop member profiles that enable us to focus our site, services and  advertisements on your interests, we may correlate this log information  with other information about you, such as your registration information  or newspaper subscription records.<br>
  <strong><br>
    Use of Cookies</strong><br>
                                      Most standard Web browsers contain a feature called "cookies," which  allow a Web site to place information about a user's visit to that Web  site in a small data text file that is stored on the user's computer.  Our use of cookie technology will likely be transparent to you and is  used to recognize you and hold information from one visit to the next  in an effort to increase your ease of use of LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  and to allow us to better understand how people use our site through  click-stream analysis. For example, cookies are used to store your  membername and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that  information each time you visit. Another example is that we may use  cookie technology to control the number of times you see a particular advertisement while  visiting LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  . You can turn the cookies feature off by using your browser preference  options, but doing so will severely limit your access to  LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  and may prevent you from registration.<br>
  <br>
                                      Some of LETTER-SAMPLES.COM's third party content providers also may  place a cookie on the user's computer. If a user chooses to monitor or  restrict cookies that are placed on his computer, the user can  determine the Web site that is attempting to place a cookie. Those  cookies are controlled by the content provider, and users should refer  to that provider's privacy policy for further information regarding its  use of cookies.<br>
  <br>
                                      We use software developed by several other companies to display  advertising on LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  , and we may use cookies in conjunction with displaying those ads. In  addition, advertisers may elect to use other advertising companies to  serve their ads on LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  , and advertisers themselves may also place a cookie on a user's  computer. We do not have access to the cookies or their contents that  are placed by advertisers or by third-party advertising companies.<br>
  <strong><br>
    Use of Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
                                      Personally Identifiable Information may be accessed by the user who  entered it and by LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  personnel, and by certain third parties, such as those who provide technical support or content services to LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  . We ask these third parties to keep any personal information supplied  by us confidential. We also endeavor to keep your Personally  Identifiable Information inaccessible to other users or advertisers of  LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  . Note that your first name may be displayed on LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  when you visit LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  as a logged in member. We will also display your e-mail address and  contact information in your Member Center. We make every effort to make  the Member Center secure, such that; it can only be accessed by logging  in with your member name and password.</p>
                                    <p> We also reserve the right to disclose Personally Identifiable  Information when deemed necessary or appropriate to comply with the  law, respond to claims, protect our computer systems and customers, ensure the integrity and operation of our business and  systems, or protect the rights, property or safety of  LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  , its affiliates, or others.</p>
                                    <p>We  will not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information without your  advance permission except as explained in this privacy policy or as  explained at the time the information was collected.<br>
                                        <strong><br>
                                          Use of Aggregated information</strong><br>
                                      In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers  and others, we may use your Personally Identifiable Information to  create a compiled, aggregate view of the LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  audience and their usage patterns. We use Aggregated Information to  operate our services and to better understand our audience as we  develop new content and services. Aggregated Information may also be  shared with third parties we contract with to provide content and  services on LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  as well as advertisers so that they can better understand our audience.  For example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users  are female or within a certain age range or live within a cluster of  zip codes.<br>
  <strong><br>
    Children's Privacy</strong><br>
                                      LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  is particularly concerned with providing a safe online environment for  children. Children under the age 13 will not be allowed to register and  become a member of LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  in order to access general LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  content, features and services.<br>
  <br>
                                      In the near future, parents and legal guardians of children under  age 13 who register are able to establish a member account for their  child by accessing the Member Center. Other areas and services operated  by LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  that do not require registration but that ask for Personally  Identifiable Information from children under age 13 will require a  parental consent before collecting the information. Further, we limit  most of our contests to people who are at least 18 years of age, making  children ineligible to enter.<br>
  <br>
                                      Parental consent to collect information about children can be  provided in two ways: (1) Fax a copy of a completed Parental Consent  Form, including your signature, to the facsimile number provided on the  Parental Consent Form. This form will be available in applicable areas  of our site. (2) Mail a completed Parental Consent Form to the address  indicated.<br>
  <br>
                                      LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  will not knowingly disclose personal information about users under the  age of 13 without prior parental or legal guardian consent, except as  required by law. </p>
                                    <p>LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  strongly  recommends parental supervision when a child uses the Internet,  particularly when a child enters a forum or uses e-mail. We also  encourage parents to instruct their children not to give out personal  information in these areas.<br>
                                        <strong><br>
                                          Member Mail and E-mail Offers</strong><br>

If a user granted permission to receive  solicitations (referred to as E-mail Offers) at the time of  registration but subsequently wishes to opt out from receiving such  solicitations, the user may go to the Member Center and change one or  more of the category-specific permission related to receiving e-mail  from TLETTER-SAMPLES.COM  advertisers.<br>
  <br>
                                      All registered users will receive periodic Member Mail via e-mail  related to their membership account or various features and services on  LETTER-SAMPLES.COM  that their membership entitles them to access. Because Member Mail is  an important part of our service to you, users cannot opt-out of  receiving Member Mail.<br>
  <br>
                                      When a user specifically authorizes e-mail solicitations we make  available the user names and other Personally Identifiable Information  in accordance with the applicable license.<br>
  <br>
                                      Our HTML-encoded e-mail messages may include graphic files, which we  use to gather information about e-mails sent our members. When such a  message is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient's  computer accesses our server to retrieve the graphic file, and allows  us to record and store the date and time, the recipient's e-mail  address, and other standard logging information. These HTML-encoded  e-mail messages may also read cookies.<br>

While our site supports P3P, the resulting code  has inherent limitations such that it does not fully and may not  accurately express all of our data practices. Some P3P-enabled browsers  may interpret the same P3P code in different ways, while others may  interpret P3P code in a manner inconsistent with the original  intention. Accordingly, your browser's interpretation of the P3P code  should only be considered as a short-hand expression of our privacy  practices. This Privacy Policy remains our primary policy, and takes  precedence over the P3P code for all purposes.<br>
