This Act states that your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 in fraudulent credit card charges. If your bank does hold you liable for $50.00 or less, we'll cover your liability provided the unauthorized, fraudulent use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own and from purchases made from us over our secure server.

<p><span style="color: #808080; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>ELECTRONIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your registration information with any information you've already left with us (we call that information your personal profile).

<p><span style="color: #808080; font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>CUSTOMER PROFILES </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.

We use this information to send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and exciting services that we offer. When you order from us, we ask for your credit card number and billing address. We use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that time. For your convenience, we do save billing information in case you want to order from us again, but we don't use this information again without your permission. We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.&nbsp;<a class="links" href="http://lehren.co/about-us" target="_self">Lehren Networks Private Limited</a>&nbsp;will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on&nbsp;<a class="links" href="http://lehren.co/about-us" target="_self">Lehren Networks Private Limited</a>&nbsp;or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of&nbsp;<a class="links" href="http://lehren.co/about-us" target="_self">Lehren Networks Private Limited</a>&nbsp;and its family of Web sites, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of&nbsp;<a class="links" href="http://lehren.co/about-us" target="_self">Lehren Networks Private Limited</a>, its Web sites, or the public.</span></p>
