<h2>1. Data about your visit to our website</h2>
<h3>1a. What data do we collect?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To track and report on website traffic, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service offered by Google. No personal information is stored in Google Analytics or shared with Google. We have taken the following measures to ensure this: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No personally identifiable information is present in page titles, URLs, event actions or other dimensions. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have enabled the feature to anonymise IP addresses in Google Analytics. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We no not use remarketing or advertising reporting features. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not use demographics and interest reports. </span></li>

</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our website is hosted by SiteGround, a leading web hosting service provider. SiteGround stores IP addresses and visited pages with a timestamp in their server logs. &nbsp;</span></p>
