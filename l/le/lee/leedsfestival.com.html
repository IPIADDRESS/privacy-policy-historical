<br>
Each year we are faced with the mammoth task of cleaning up the fields which&nbsp;are usually strewn with huge amounts of used camping equipment including TENTS, SLEEPING BAGS and CAMPING MATS.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Until now we have only been able to work with charities in the main to collect good equipment and a vast majority of the remainder end up going straight to LANDFILL because a traditional tent is made up of many different components such as FIBRE GLASS POLES, NYLON ZIPS and METAL PEGS which makes them un-economical to separate for recycling.<br>
<br>
Their ground breaking range starts with a 2 man dome tent and is topped by a deluxe 6 man, 3 bedroom version which is tall enough to stand up in.They have even manufactured their SLEEPING BAGS and CAMPING MATS from the same single product making them more festival friendly.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
So if you’re going to be purchasing a new tent for this year’s&nbsp;Reading festival please visit <a href="http://www.thegreententcompany.co.uk/festivalchoose.asp?mychosenfestival=5">www.thegreententcompany.co.uk</a> and help us to reduce our carbon footprint, thus SAVING THE PLANET.</p><a class="tab_button" href="http://www.thegreententcompany.co.uk/webpage.asp?menuitemcode=123&amp;amp;main=yes&amp;amp;mainmenu=Main+Products+" title="Buy now">Buy</a><p class="top_link"><a href="#content" title="Return to the top of the page">Back to top</a></p></article><article><h3>Podpads<span><span>from</span>£375</span></h3><p>Glamping? - call it what you like - Alternative/Cool/Posh/Boutique Camping ….. but, staying in a 'podpad' will give you that unforgettable snug, smug festival experience.<br>
