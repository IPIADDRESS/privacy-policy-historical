<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<hr>                          
<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p align="justify">
	Like most website operators, LeechGod.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
	browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
	and the date and time of each visitor request. LeechGod.com purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
	information is to better understand how LeechGod.com visitors use its website. From time to time, LeechGod.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in
	the usage of its website.
</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">
	LeechGod.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
	addresses. LeechGod.com does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not
	disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
	personally-identifying information, as described below.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p align="justify">
	Certain visitors to LeechGod.com websites choose to interact with LeechGod.com in ways that require LeechGod.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that LeechGod.com gathers
	depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our website and chooses to register, provide a username
	and email address. In each case, LeechGod.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
	appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with LeechGod.com. LeechGod.com does not
	disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to
	supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
	website-related activities.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
<p align="justify">
	LeechGod.com may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, LeechGod.com may reveal how many downloads a particular file got, or say which plugins are most popular based on checks from
	polls. However, LeechGod.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p align="justify">
	LeechGod.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of
	its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
	process it on LeechGod.com’s behalf or to provide services available at LeechGod.com websites, and (ii) that
	have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be
	located outside of your home country; by using LeechGod.com websites, you consent to the transfer of such
	information to them. LeechGod.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
	personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated
	organizations, as described above, LeechGod.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and
	personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when LeechGod.com believes in good
	faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of LeechGod.com,
	third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a LeechGod.com website and have supplied
	your email address, LeechGod.com may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit
	your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with LeechGod.com and our products. We try to keep this type of email to a minimum.
	If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the
	right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
	LeechGod.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration,
	or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p align="justify">
	A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s
	browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. LeechGod.com uses cookies to help LeechGod.com identify and track visitors, their usage of LeechGod.com website, and their website access preferences.
	LeechGod.com visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to
	refuse cookies before using LeechGod.com websites, with the drawback that certain features of LeechGod.com websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p align="justify">
	Although most changes are likely to be minor, LeechGod.com may change its Privacy Policy from time to time,
	and in LeechGod.com sole discretion. LeechGod.com encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any
	changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will
	constitute your acceptance of such change.
