					</ul>
<p><b>3. How your information is used.</b> We use the information you provide on your loan or realty request to match you with up to four participating Lenders, real estate professionals or authorized agents. We may also send your information to other third parties relevant to your transaction. Lenders will also receive your credit history when they review your request. LendingTree may also share certain aggregated data with our Lenders and other third parties for general marketing and demographic purposes; however, this data DOES NOT include any of your personal identifying information.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Sharing information with our participating Lenders and real estate professionals.</b> At your direction (when you click on the "Submit" button), the information that you provide to us on the loan or realty request will be sent through the LendingTree system and presented to up to four participating Lenders who offer the types of loan products you have identified, other parties relevant to your transaction and/or participating real estate professionals. Lenders will also receive your credit history when they review your request. If you complete the first page of the loan request form (by hitting the "Continue" button on "Page 1: Tell Us About Your Loan") but leave portions of the form incomplete, LendingTree will transmit your loan request form to up to 4 of its lenders who can help you complete your loan request and possibly extend you loan offers.  By completing the first page of the loan request form, you authorize LendingTree to transmit your loan request form to up to 4 lenders.  No credit check will be performed on behalf of LendingTree until you authorize us to do so by submitting a completed loan request. As our Lenders and real estate professionals may keep and use your information whether or not you qualify for a loan with them or use their services, we recommend that you contact them directly for more information about their specific privacy policies. In addition, if you qualify for the <a href="/stmrc/Auto2ndChance.asp?bp=&amp;inline=true">CarLoan.com</a>, <a href="/stmrc/Auto2ndChance3.asp?bp=&amp;inline=true">Car.com</a>, or <a href="/stmrc/Auto2ndChance2.asp?bp=&amp;inline=true">Auto Second Chance Program</a>, LendingTree will share your information with one of the partners in that program. You should consult them for information on their privacy policies. <a href="#more_sharelender">More details…</a></li><br><br>
						<li><b>Sharing information with third parties.</b> We may also act as an agent for our participating Lenders and real estate professionals, sharing information on their behalf and pursuant to their instructions with providers of services related to your transaction. In addition, LendingTree may notify you about a special offer from one of our promotional partners. We do not reveal your name, address or any other identifying information to that promotional partner unless you request us to do so.  <a href="#more_sharethird">More details…</a></li><br><br>

In such situations, we will be acting on behalf of the Lender, under the authority of the Lender's privacy policy, a copy of which you will receive from the Lender.
