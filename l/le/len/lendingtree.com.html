                                                        or our services, we may share your expression of interest with the businesses with

                                                    <li>Other lenders or investors. If you submit a completed LendingTree or GetSmart Loan
                                                        Qualification Form ("QF"), we may share your personal information with lenders on
                                                        the LendingTree network with whom you are or may be matched, or if you are matched
                                                        with LendingTree Loans, third party investors to whom we intend to transfer your
                                                        loan after closing. If you finish the first page of the LendingTree QF (by hitting
                                                        the "continue" button on "Page 1: Tell Us About Your Loan") but leave portions of
                                                        the QF incomplete, we may share your personal information with lenders on the LendingTree
                                                        network or with LendingTree Loans, who may help you complete your loan request and
                                                        possibly extend loan offers to you. However, no credit check will be performed by
                                                        LendingTree unless you authorize us to do so by submitting a completed QF. The lenders
                                                        with whom you are matched (i.e., the lenders with whom LendingTree shares your information)
                                                        will be disclosed to you, and LendingTree will not share information with other
                                                        lenders not disclosed to you. Because the lenders on the LendingTree network with
                                                        whom you are matched may retain or use your personal information whether or not
                                                        you qualify for, or obtain, a loan from them, you should contact these lenders directly
                                                        concerning their privacy and information sharing practices.</li>
                                                    <li>Other IAC businesses. We are part of the IAC family of businesses (go to <a href="http://www.iac.com" target="_new">www.iac.com</a> for a listing of these businesses). We may share information
                                                        we collect, including personal information, with the IAC companies (some of which
                                                        are nonfinancial companies). Sharing information with the IAC companies enables
                                                        us to provide you with information about a variety of products and services that
                                                        might interest you. All IAC companies comply with the IAC <a href="/stmrc/summary.asp?inline=true">Consumer Privacy</a>.
                                                        The IAC companies also will comply with applicable privacy and security laws and,
                                                        at a minimum, in any commercial e-mail they send to you, will give you the opportunity
                                                        to choose not to receive such e-mail messages from that company in the future. However,
                                                        in no circumstance will LendingTree share with other IAC companies any personally
                                                        identifiable information that you provide to us if that information bears on your
                                                        creditworthiness. Special notice to California residents: LendingTree will not share
                                                        any personal information about you with other IAC companies to the extent prohibited
                                                        by applicable California law or to the extent your prior consent to share is required

                                                    <li>Other Situations. We also may disclose your information:</li>
                                                    <li>In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request
                                                        for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish

                                                        by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available

                                                    <li>When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate,
                                                        prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other
                                                        wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company,

                                                    Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own
                                                    privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information.
                                                    Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information
                                                    once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.

                                                    Aggregated and non-personal information. We may share aggregated information (i.e.,
                                                    information about you and other customers collectively, but not specifically identifiable
                                                    to you) and other non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances.
                                                    We may also share it with third parties and IAC companies to develop and deliver
                                                    targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine
                                                    non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected
                                                    from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties,
                                                    including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general
                                                    business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors
                                                    to our websites and the most popular features or services accessed. This information

                                                    We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural
                                                    measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and
                                                    disclosure. For example, only authorized employees and authorized third-party service
                                                    providers are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only
                                                    for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission
                                                    of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use
                                                    firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal

                                                    We want you to feel confident using our websites to transact business. However,
                                                    no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure
                                                    your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal
                                                    information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users
                                                    should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information.
