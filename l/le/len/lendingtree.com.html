<p><strong>Your Privacy is Important to Us</strong>. At LendingTree, your privacy is our chief concern. We understand that you entrust us with your private financial information to help us match you with a bank, lender or loan broker (we refer to all of these as "Lenders") or real estate professional who can meet your needs. In exchange for your trust, you expect and deserve our commitment to treat your information with respect. Rest assured that we protect your privacy. Under no circumstances will LendingTree sell or share any personal information about you to or with any person or organization except: as authorized by you, to participating lenders, real estate professionals or other parties involved in your transaction, or as may be required by law or court order. The Privacy Policy below describes the standards we adhere to in handling information about you and your loan request.</p>

						<li><strong>Technical information we collect.</strong> In order for us to ensure that we are providing the best possible consumer experience on a LendingTree Web site, we collect and track certain user information. <a href="#more_techinfo">More details…</a></li><br><br>
						<li><strong>Information from surveys.</strong> You may complete a survey from LendingTree online. Participation in surveys is completely voluntary and it is your choice whether or not you wish to disclose your personal information to us. <a href="#more_surveyinfo">More details…</a></li><br><br>
						<li><b>Information from the "Contact Us" section of a LendingTree Web site.</b> You may contact LendingTree through the "Contact Us" feature. Participation in this area is completely voluntary and it is your choice whether or not you wish to disclose your personal information to us. <a href="#more_contactinfo">More details…</a></li><br><br>
						<li><b>Information gathered from Lenders.</b> The "Lenders" section of our Web sites contain information for Lenders who wish to join The LendingTree Network or license our Lend-X<sup>SM</sup> technology. <a href="#more_lenderinfo">More details…</a></li><br><br>
						<li><b>Information gathered from Real Estate brokers.</b> The "Real Estate Network" section of our Web sites contain information for Real Estate brokers who wish to join the LendingTree Realty Services Network. <a href="#more_realtorinfo">More details…</a></li><br><br>
						<li><b>Information gathered from the "Affiliates" section of a LendingTree Web site.</b> The "Affiliates" section contains information for affiliates who wish to join the LendingTree Affiliate Program and advertise LendingTree's service on their site. If you would like to be an affiliate, you may submit an application containing personal information such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number and address.

					</ul>
<p><b>3. How your information is used.</b> We use the information you provide on your loan or realty request to match you with participating Lenders, real estate professionals or authorized agents. We may also send your information to other third parties relevant to your transaction. Lenders will also receive your credit history when they review your request. LendingTree may also share certain aggregated data with our Lenders and other third parties for general marketing and demographic purposes; however, this data DOES NOT include any of your personal identifying information.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Sharing information with our participating Lenders and real estate professionals.</b> At your direction (when you click on the "Submit" button), the information that you provide to us on the loan or realty request will be sent through the LendingTree system and presented to up to five participating Lenders who offer the types of loan products you have identified (provided, however, that if one of the Lenders is unable to make an offer, LendingTree may submit your information to additional Lenders until such time as you have received five loan offers (up to a maximum of 9 total Lenders)), other parties relevant to your transaction and/or participating real estate professionals. Lenders will also receive your credit history when they review your request. If you complete the first page of the loan request form (by hitting the "Continue" button on "Page 1: Tell Us About Your Loan") but leave portions of the form incomplete, LendingTree will transmit your loan request form to up to 5 of its lenders who can help you complete your loan request and possibly extend you loan offers.  By completing the first page of the loan request form, you authorize LendingTree to transmit your loan request form to the lenders as described above.  If you select either of the non-traditional options available (LendingTree’s QuickMatch program or using LendingTree’s GetSmart network to supplement your loan request), your loan request may be sent to lenders on LendingTree’s GetSmart network (GetSmart is an internal division of LendingTree).  If you select the QuickMatch option, your loan request will be sent to up to 5 lenders on the GetSmart network.  If you select to have GetSmart supplement your LendingTree loan request, your loan request will be sent to GetSmart lenders only if you did not receive 5 offers from LendingTree lenders, and you may receive up to 5 matches from GetSmart in addition to any LendingTree lenders making offers.  Each process is described in more detail in LendingTree’s Terms of Use and only happens when authorized by you.  No credit check will be performed on behalf of LendingTree until you authorize us to do so by submitting a completed loan request. As our Lenders and real estate professionals may keep and use your information whether or not you qualify for a loan with them or use their services, we recommend that you contact them directly for more information about their specific privacy policies. In addition, if you qualify for the <a href="/stmrc/Auto2ndChance.asp?bp=&amp;inline=true">CarLoan.com</a>, <a href="/stmrc/Auto2ndChance3.asp?bp=&amp;inline=true">Car.com</a>, or <a href="/stmrc/Auto2ndChance2.asp?bp=&amp;inline=true">Auto Second Chance Program</a>, LendingTree will share your information with one of the partners in that program. You should consult them for information on their privacy policies. <a href="#more_sharelender">More details…</a></li><br><br>
						<li><b>Sharing information with third parties.</b> We may also act as an agent for our participating Lenders and real estate professionals, sharing information on their behalf and pursuant to their instructions with providers of services related to your transaction. In addition, LendingTree may notify you about a special offer from one of our promotional partners. We do not reveal your name, address or any other identifying information to that promotional partner unless you request us to do so.  <a href="#more_sharethird">More details…</a></li><br><br>
						<li><b>Sharing information with authorized agents.</b> At your direction (when you click on the "Submit" button or on the "Continue" button on "Page 1: Tell Us About Your Loan" on the loan request form), the information you provide to us on the loan or realty request will be sent through the LendingTree system and may be presented to our authorized agents. Our authorized agents do not sell or share your personal information with any person or organization.</li>
					</ul>
<p><b>4. Altering Information You Submit Through a LendingTree Web Site.</b> LendingTree puts you in control of your experience on our Web sites. You'll find our sites easy to navigate to find all the information you need to complete your transaction.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Changing your information.</b> You may be able to review and change personal information in an active loan or realty request that you completed through LendingTree online. If you are unable to complete this online, you may contact our <a href="/stm3/contactus/contactus-email.asp?source=&amp;siteid=&amp;esourceid=&amp;partner=">Customer Care Department</a> for assistance. <a href="#more_changeinfo">More details…</a></li><br><br>
						<li><b>Deleting your information.</b> Federal and state regulations require that we store completed loan and real estate requests for various periods of time. In order to comply with these regulations, we cannot delete information from our databases. <a href="#more_deleteinfo">More details…</a></li><br><br>
						<li><b>Request to stop receiving emails from us.</b> Periodically, LendingTree may send you emails to alert you to money saving tips or special offers. If you do not wish to receive any of these offers, please visit our <a href="http://www.lendingtree.com/subscriptions/">subscription area</a> where you can remove yourself from our mailing list.</li><br><br>
						<li><b>Security.</b> LendingTree sites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Please visit our <a href="/stmrc/security2.asp?bp=&amp;inline=true">Security</a> page for a detailed explanation.</li>
					</ul>
<p><b>5. How Our Policy is Monitored.</b> LendingTree is proud to hold the TRUSTe seal. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit initiative whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting TRUSTe's principles of fair information practices. Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to respecting your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices as stated above. In addition, LendingTree has agreed to have our privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact our <a href="/stm3/contactus/contactus-email.asp?source=&amp;siteid=&amp;esourceid=&amp;partner=">Customer Care Department</a>. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.</p>
<p>If we make a change to our Privacy Policy in the future that will affect how we treat your information, we will notify you of the change. In that case, your ability to opt out of the new policy will be determined by applicable laws and we will include that information in our notification. If the change impacts how we use your information, we will notify you even if you have requested that we not contact you.</p>

<p><b>3. How your information is used.</b></p>
					<ul><a name="more_sharelender">
						<li><b>Sharing information with our participating Lenders and real estate professionals.</b> After participating Lenders and/or real estate professionals receive your information, they may contact you directly via phone, e-mail or other communications. All of our Lenders and real estate agents operate under federal and/or state laws and regulations and believe, as we do, that the Internet is an exciting and secure place to do business. If you are matched with any participating Lenders, the Lender with which you choose to close your loan and/or obtain your credit card will report certain information about your loan and/or credit card to LendingTree, and LendingTree will treat that information in the manner it treats the information you provided on your loan or realty request. As our Lenders and real estate professionals may keep and use your information whether or not you qualify for a transaction with them, we recommend that you contact them directly for more information about their specific privacy policies.</li><br><br></a><a name="more_sharethird">
						</a><li><a name="more_sharethird"><b>Sharing information with third parties.</b> Following is an example of how LendingTree may act as an agent for our participating Lenders and real estate professionals. A Lender may instruct us to share information with an appraiser to prepare an appraisal of the property to be mortgaged, with a flood certification provider to determine whether the property lies in a flood plain, or with a prospective secondary market purchaser of the mortgage loan the lender may make. In such situations, we will be acting on behalf of the Lender, under the authority of the Lender's privacy policy, a copy of which you will receive from the Lender. All of the information-sharing we do as agent for the Lender would be permissible under applicable federal law for the Lender to do directly.<br><br>From time to time, LendingTree may notify you about a special offer from one of our promotional partners. At your request, LendingTree will not send you any information or offers unrelated to your request for financing. If you do not wish to receive any of these offers, please visit our </a><a href="/subscriptions" target="_new">subscription area</a> where you can remove yourself from our mailing list.</li>
