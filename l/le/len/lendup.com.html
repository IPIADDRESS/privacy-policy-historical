        <p>LendUp Global, Inc. and its affiliates (“LendUp” or “we”) respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personally identifiable information (“PII”) that may be collected through your use of our website or mobile application (together, “Site”) or in applying for or receiving any of our products or services (“Services”).

We may request additional PII that is necessary to process any application submitted by you, such as your physical address, Social Security number, mobile phone number, date of birth, bank account information and numbers, employment and income information.  Additionally, we may collect PII to verify your identity, for security-related purposes, or other administrative purposes.  In order to provide Services to you, we may on occasion supplement the PII you submit to us with information from third-party sources, such as consumer report information.</p>
        <p>If you contact us, tell us your story, or otherwise provide us with information about yourself, we will maintain records of your correspondence.  This may include any of your questions, comments, or suggestions.  You may also provide us with the email addresses of your contacts and include a personal message to your contacts if you choose to participate in our referral program.</p>

        <h4 class="small-caps">Account and Transaction Information</h4>

        <p>We may automatically collect the following types of information as you use our Site and Services.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> We collect certain information automatically through your use of the Site, such as which of our web pages you access, the frequency of access, and what you click on while on our Site.</li>
          <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> We may collect information about your actual location which may be determined from: IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may reveal information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points, and cell towers.</li>
          <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect information about the device you are using such as: hardware model, operating system, application version number, browser, and IP addresses.</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile Device Information:</strong> In addition to the Device Information listed above, when you access our Site or Services via a browser on your mobile device or through the use of our mobile application, we may also collect mobile network information including phone number, the unique device identifier assigned to that device, mobile carrier, operating system, and other device attributes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="small-caps">Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies </h4>
        <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site.  The session ID cookie expires 24 hours after you sign in to our Site.</li>
          <li><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> We use persistent cookies that remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Site may be limited.  For example, you cannot create an account with us or take out a loan or other product without accepting cookies.</p>
        <p>We may use a software technology called tracking pixels (a.k.a. web beacons or clear gifs) that help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is most effective.  Tracking pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, tracking pixels are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
        <p>We may also use other website or mobile tracking technologies, such as device fingerprinting, to identify you and keep track of your preferences, prevent fraudulent activity or improve Site security, assess the performance of the Site, and deliver content to you based on your interests on our site and third-party sites.</p>

        <h4 class="small-caps">Aggregate Information</h4>
