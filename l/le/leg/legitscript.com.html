<h2 class="page-title">LegitScript Privacy Policy</h2>


<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>
We recognize your right to confidentiality and are committed to protecting your privacy. LegitScript does not purchase or sell personal information or any information that would be considered Protected Health Information (PHI) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). We are pleased to accept information from individuals, which be submitted anonymously or non-anonymously, regarding online pharmacies or other websites of concern. If you choose to share your personal information with us, including information about any prescription drugs have ordered in the past, or websites you have ordered from, we will not share any PHI about you without your permission. 
</p><p>
  
</p><h3>Information Automatically Collected</h3>
<p>
We automatically receive and collect certain types of information whenever you visit our Web stores. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies" and Web beacons (described below) and obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our Web sites. This information includes the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer, your browser software and operating system, your web server, the date and time you access our site, session information (such as websites searched for within our database, download errors and page response times), information about your viewing, search and purchase history and information about the referring URL and the URL clickstream to, through, and from our Web sites. We use this information to monitor the usage and performance of our site, to enhance our customers' search experiences and to determine aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns.
</p><p>
  
</p><h3>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h3>
<p>
We protect all of your information against unauthorized access or release. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, and/or legal process served on us; and/or to protect our rights and the rights of our customers; or to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or other policies or user agreements. We share your personal information with third parties in response to a government subpoena or other official and lawful government order for information.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
</p><p>
  
</p><h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
To personalize and enhance your browsing and shopping experience, we use a feature on your Internet browser called a cookie. Cookies are small files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. Although we do not store personal information in cookies, we do tie cookies to customer member IP address which is then used to pull personal information out of the database for identification purposes. Cookies also let us know how you found us (e.g., through a particular web site or advertisement). Cookies are not used to access information entered on the secure server. This information can be accessed only when you enter your name and password. If you choose to configure your browser to remove or reject our cookies, you will not be able to make purchases from our Web stores or take advantage of many of our features, such as Your Listâ„¢.
</p><p>
  
</p><h3>Web Beacons</h3>
<p>
From time to time we contract with third party companies to help us better provide relevant products, services and information to you and to help us effectively measure advertising effectiveness. Some of these companies use cookies and/or Web beacons (also known as action tags or single pixel gifs). A Web beacon is a transparent image that has been placed on a Web page and sends a signal when a user has visited that page. A Web beacon does not contain any personal information. No information that is personally identifiable to you is transmitted to the third party using the Web beacon. The third party is required to protect the privacy of the information it receives using Web beacons or cookies and is not allowed to use the information it receives for any purpose beyond what is necessary to assist us. In addition, we may use web beacons in connection with the e-mails we send to our customers, to determine whether and when the images in our e-mail were rendered (which allows us to determine whether the e-mail was opened). This information may then be aggregated and used to assess the effectiveness of our e-mail communications.
</p><p>
  
</p><h3>Unsolicited E-mail (SPAM)</h3>
<p>
Your privacy is very important to us. Be assured that, in accordance with this privacy policy, we do not sell or distribute our customer list to third parties. You should be aware, however, that unscrupulous marketers can sometimes "harvest" your e-mail address directly from your computer or another person's address book or even obtain your e-mail address through programs that automatically search web pages and e-mail traffic for e-mail addresses. 
</p><p>
  
</p><h3>Your Consent</h3>
<p>
By using our Web site (including through our customer service line), you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of information in accordance with the terms of this privacy policy. We reserve the right to modify or amend this policy at any time. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by e-mail, or by means of a notice on our homepage so that you are always aware of the information that we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Unless we clearly state otherwise, the changes to our privacy policy will affect only the information we collect after the effective date of the change.
