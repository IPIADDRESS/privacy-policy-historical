                      technology in the transmission of logon identification and passwords. SSL technology provides

                      your experiences with our system.<br>
					  
					  <br>Except for communications that relate directly to the service being provided, you may "opt out" of receiving   communications from us.

					  <br>In order to achieve the benefits of the LegalMatch service, there are some situations in which personal information may be disclosed 
                      to third parties.  These are:<br>
                      
                      <br><li>Service related disclosure</li><br>

                      to connect attorneys with the people who need them. The users have full control over when and to whom personally identifying information is disclosed. Our service is designed specifically to keep initial exchanges of information between clients and attorneys anonymous. The limited information we disclose is described below.<br> 
                      <br><li>When a user posts a description of his or her legal matter, that information is reviewed only by attorneys and LegalMatch staff. The information is anonymous, meaning that the user's personally identifying information is kept hidden.</li><br>

                      contact information, the user'
s name and zip code may be 
                      revealed to that attorney for the purpose of verifying whether 
                      an attorney-client relationship was formed. The attorney 
                      is precluded from using this information to contact the 
                      user.</li><br>
					  <br><li>The name of the user posting a rating and commentary for any attorney on this system may be released to that attorney, at the attorney'
s request, for the purpose of replying to the rating.</li><br>
                     <br><li> Information regarding whether an attorney-client relationship was formed will be used only for our internal records and statistics. We will not disclose this information to other parties, unless we are required to do so by law.</li><br>
                      <br><li>Except for the information referred to above, user'
s contact information (i.e. address, telephone, fax, or e-mail) is never revealed to attorneys or other users.</li><br>
                        <br><li>Partnership Related Disclosure.If you are on a site that is "Partner Site powered by LegalMatch" or whose address is www.partner.legalmatch.com, this means that LegalMatch has a partnership with the Partner Site and that LegalMatch may share some of your registration information with that partner.

                          <br>Whenever LegalMatch shares personally identifying information with a partner, we will do so confidentiality and require use restrictions on the information.<br>
                           <br><li>Legal Related Disclosure.</li><br>
					  <br>LegalMatch.com may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to:<br> 
					  <br><li>comply with law</li><br> 
					  <br><li>enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or</li><br>
					   <br><li>protect the rights, property or 
                      safety of LegalMatch.com, our users, or others.</li><br></span>
