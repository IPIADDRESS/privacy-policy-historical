<h2>Privacy and Security Statement</h2>
<p>At LegalMatch.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy. It is also our goal to constantly improve our services to you and to keep up with rapidly changing technologies. In order to maximize our services to you, we use information collected about you while still protecting your privacy. Expecting future variations in our service, these policies are subject to change. If there are any modifications to these policies, we will post them on this page and notify you as described at the end of this policy.</p>
<h3>I. Security Measures Concerning Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>While transmission of information over the Internet cannot be guaranteed 100% secure, we make every effort to provide protection for the information that we collect about you. We, on our fully functional site, will use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology in the transmission of logon identification and passwords. SSL technology provides advanced encryption tools that convert the information you input into code before it is sent to us. The encryption helps protect you and the information in your account.</p>
<p>In addition to SSL technology:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your personal information is password-protected. It is our policy to never sell or share traceable information about our users to third parties without user permission. See "Use of Information Collected" below.</li>
	<li>Advanced firewall technologies protect our database from outsiders.</li>
	<li>Your password and password reminder answers are kept encrypted at all times, so they cannot be decoded even if someone gains access to our database.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, to avoid unauthorized use of your account by others, you must take steps to control your password. Further, this site contains various links to other Web sites. LegalMatch.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. You should not assume that other sites take similar steps in securing your information and should evaluate their privacy standards before using their systems.</p>
<h3>II. Collection of Information</h3>
<p>When you register with LegalMatch.com, we ask that you provide your name, e-mail address, and zip code. If you are an attorney or other professional services provider, you will also be asked to provide your firm name, address, telephone number, state where you are licensed, and bar number. In the course of your use of the site, we may also request additional information from you. For example, if you are an attorney or other professional services provider, you will be asked to describe your areas of practice, experience, and education. If you are searching for an attorney, you will be asked to describe your situation so that attorneys can evaluate your legal needs and make a response to work for you.</p>

<h3>III. Use of Collected Information</h3>
<p>The primary reason that LegalMatch collects information from its users is to match the right attorneys and professional services providers with the people and businesses who need them.</p>
<p>LegalMatch.com does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others without your permission. We use your information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze site usage, and improve our site's content, offering, and layout. Your IP address may be used to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and for security needs. LegalMatch.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal identifying information.</p>

We may also contact you to verify your information or ask you about your experiences with our system.</p>

If you are seeking an attorney, required communications include (1) confirmation of your registration, (2) notification that attorneys have made responses to work on your case and (3) requests to determine which attorney (if any) you have retained.

<p>In order to achieve the benefits of the LegalMatch service, there are some situations in which personal information may be disclosed to third parties. These are: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Service related disclosure: This Web site is designed to disclose certain limited information to connect attorneys with the people who need them. The users have full control over when and to whom personally identifying information is disclosed. Our service is designed specifically to keep initial exchanges of information between clients and attorneys anonymous. The limited information we disclose is described below.</li>
	<li>When a user posts a description of his or her legal matter, that information is reviewed only by attorneys, LegalMatch members or potential members and LegalMatch staff. The information is anonymous, meaning that the user's personally identifying information is kept hidden unless the user chooses to release it. If the user chose to release personally identifying information, it will only be released to LegalMatch members and staff. If LegalMatch does not currently have member attorneys in the user's area, the user may be asked to release case and personally identifying information to our affiliates who have interested attorneys.  </li>
	<li>When an attorney responds to a posted matter, the response, the name and the contact information of the responding attorney is seen only by the specific client.</li>
	<li>If a user requests an attorney's contact information, the user's name and zip code may be revealed to that attorney for the purpose of verifying whether an attorney-client relationship was formed. The attorney is precluded from using this information to contact the user.</li>
	<li>The name of the user posting a rating and commentary for any attorney on this system may be released to that attorney, at the attorney's request, for the purpose of replying to the rating.</li>
	<li>The name of the user notifying us that an attorney-client relationship was formed through our service may be released to that attorney for the purpose of verifying the relationship.</li>
	<li>Information regarding whether an attorney-client relationship was formed will be used only for our internal records and statistics. We will not disclose this information to other parties, unless we are required to do so by law.</li>
	<li>Except for the information referred to above, user's contact information (i.e. address,		telephone, fax, or e-mail) is never revealed to attorneys or other users. User's name and contact information may be revealed to LegalMatch sponsors if you elect to have the sponsor contact you.  You will have the opportunity to review the sponsor's privacy policy before selecting to share your information with the sponsor.</li>  
	<li>Partnership Related Disclosure.If you are on a site that is "Partner Site powered by LegalMatch" or whose address is www.partner.legalmatch.com, this means that LegalMatch has a partnership with the Partner Site and that LegalMatch may share some of your registration information with that partner.
