                      <span class="text"><br>The primary reason that LegalMatch collects information from its users is to match the right attorneys with the people and businesses who need them.<br>
					 
					  <br>LegalMatch.com does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information 
                      to others. We use your information to improve our marketing 
                      and promotional efforts, statistically analyze site usage, 
                      and improve our site's content, offering, and layout. Your IP address may be used to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and for security needs. LegalMatch.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, 
                      traffic patterns, and related site information to third-party

                      information.<br>
                      
					  <br>We may use the information we collect to notify you about the 
                      status of your LegalMatch account, important functionality 
                      changes to our Web site, new LegalMatch.com services, and 
                      special offers we think you'll find valuable. We may also 
                      contact you to verify your information or ask you about 
                      your experiences with our system.<br>
					  
					  <br>Except for communications that relate directly to the service being provided, you may "opt out" of receiving   communications from us.  If you are seeking an attorney, required communications include (1) confirmation of your registration, (2) notification that attorneys have made offers to work on your case and (3) requests to determine which attorney (if any) you have retained.  If you are an attorney, required communications may include (1) confirmation of your registration, (2) notification that your registration has been verified, (3) requests to determine which LegalMatch users have retained you and the amounts billed to or collected from them and (4) if you are enrolled in a payment plan, invoices.

					  <br>In order to achieve the benefits of the LegalMatch service, there are some situations in which personal information may be disclosed 
                      to third parties.  These are:<br>
                      
                      <br><li>Service related disclosure</li><br>
                      <br>This Web site is designed to disclose certain limited information 
                      to connect attorneys with the people who need them. The users have full control over when and to whom personally identifying information is disclosed. Our service is designed specifically to keep initial exchanges of information between clients and attorneys anonymous. The limited information we disclose is described below.<br> 
                      <br><li>When a user posts a description of his or her legal matter, that information is reviewed only by attorneys and LegalMatch staff. The information is anonymous, meaning that the user's personally identifying information is kept hidden.</li><br>
                      <br><li>When an attorney responds to a posted matter by making an offer, the offer is seen only by the specific client and subscribing attorneys. The name and contact information of the offering attorney is available only to the specific client.</li><br> 
                      <br><li>The name and contact information of attorneys placing flat fee advertisements will be available to all users. If a user requests an attorney'

                      contact information, the user'
s name and zip code may be 
                      revealed to that attorney for the purpose of verifying whether 
                      an attorney-client relationship was formed. The attorney 
                      is precluded from using this information to contact the 
                      user.</li><br>
					  <br><li>The name of the user posting a rating and commentary for any attorney on this system may be released to that attorney, at the attorney'
s request, for the purpose of replying to the rating.</li><br>
                     <br><li> Information regarding whether an attorney-client relationship was formed will be used only for our internal records and statistics. We will not disclose this information to other parties, unless we are required to do so by law.</li><br>
                      <br><li>Except for the information referred to above, user'
s contact information (i.e. address, telephone, fax, or e-mail) is never revealed to attorneys or other users.</li><br>
                        <br><li>Partnership Related Disclosure.If you are on a site that is "Partner Site powered by LegalMatch" or whose address is www.partner.legalmatch.com, this means that LegalMatch has a partnership with the Partner Site and that LegalMatch may share some of your registration information with that partner.  For people and small business LegalMatch will share only your name, email address and zip code. For attorneys, LegalMatch may also share your firm name, address, telephone number, state of licensure, bar number and areas of practice.</li><br>
					  <br>LegalMatch.com may also develop business partnerships with other companies, as part of our service to users. These special business partnerships may include acquisitions by or mergers with other companies or special joint ventures that integrate our Web sites and services.<br>
                          <br>Whenever LegalMatch shares personally identifying information with a partner, we will do so confidentiality and require use restrictions on the information.<br>
                           <br><li>Legal Related Disclosure.</li><br>
					  <br>LegalMatch.com may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to:<br>

					  <br><li>enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or</li><br>
					   <br><li>protect the rights, property or 
                      safety of LegalMatch.com, our users, or others.</li><br></span>
