<h3><strong>OVERVIEW</strong><strong>&nbsp;of this Policy and Commitments to Privacy at Merlin</strong></h3>
<p>At Merlin ("<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", "<strong>our</strong>"), we regularly collect and use personal data about consumers who visit our attractions or hotels, or browse our websites.

The protection of your personal data is very important to us, and we understand our responsibilities to handle your personal data with care, to keep it secure and to comply with legal requirements.</p>
<p>The purpose of this privacy policy ("<strong>Policy</strong>") is to provide a clear explanation of when, why and how we collect and use personal data. We have designed it to be as user friendly as possible, and have labelled sections to make it easy for you to find the information that is most relevant to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please read this Policy carefully. It provides important information about how we use personal data and explains your legal rights. This Policy is not intended to override the terms of any contract that you have with us (for example, Wi-Fi terms and conditions or annual pass terms) or any rights you might have available under applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>We will make changes to this Policy from time to time for example, to keep it up to date or to comply with legal requirements or changes in the way we operate our business. We will make sure that you are aware of any significant changes by sending an email message to the email address you most recently provided to us or by posting a notice on each relevant website so that you are aware of the impact to the data processing activities before you continue to engage.

<h3><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>WHO</strong><strong>&nbsp;is responsible for looking after your personal data?</strong></h3>

<p>Please note that when you click on any of the links on the home page or contact page to visit or contact any of our LEGOLAND attractions, you will be redirected to that LEGOLAND entities website.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you do this, it will be that website which will be processing your personal data so please visit their privacy policy to understand how they use your data.</p>
<h3>2.&nbsp;WHAT&nbsp;personal data do we collect?</h3>
<p>In relation to visitors to this site ("<strong>Visitors</strong>"), we collect the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Details of your visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data and the resources that you access.</li>
<li>website data, device data including IP addresses and details about your browsing history, browser type, and session frequency and cookies - please see our cookie policy below for further details on cookies.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>WHEN</strong><strong>&nbsp;do we collect your personal data?</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Visitors</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We will collect information from you when you visit this site</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;<strong>4.&nbsp;</strong><strong>What PURPOSES do we USE your personal data for and what is the LEGAL BASIS?</strong></h3>
<p>We will use your personal data to:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.</li>
<li>allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have to establish a legal ground to use your personal data, so we will make sure that we only use your personal data for the purposes set out in this Section 4 and in Appendix 1 where we are satisfied that:</p>
<ul>
<li>our use of your personal data is necessary to support 'Legitimate Interests' that we have as a business (for example, to improve our products, or to carry out analytics across our datasets), provided it is always carried out in a way that is proportionate, and that respects your privacy rights. Please <strong>see</strong> Appendix 1 for more details about our Legitimate Interests.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Who do we SHARE your personal data with?</strong></h3>
<p>To help manage our business and deliver services, these third parties may from time to time need to have access to your personal data, and include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>service providers, who help manage our IT and this site, in particular by Isobar. </em></li>
<li><em>our regulators, which include the ICO, as well as other regulators and law enforcement agencies in the E.U. and around the world,</em></li>
<li><em>solicitors and other professional services firms (including our auditors)</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>6.&nbsp;</strong><strong>International Transfers</strong></h3>
<p>Some entities in the Merlin Group, with whom we share your data, and our service providers who have access to your personal data, are located outside the European Union. We may also share your personal data overseas, for example if we receive a legal or regulatory request from a foreign law enforcement body. We will always take steps to ensure that any international transfer of information is carefully managed to protect your rights and interests, in particular we will either:</p>
<ul>
<li>only transfer your personal data to countries which are recognised as providing an adequate level of legal protection in accordance with Article 45 of the GDPR; or</li>
<li>ensure that transfers outside the European Union are subject to an appropriate legal safeguard - for example, the EU Model Clauses pursuant to Article 46(2) of the GDPR and/or the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield for the protection of personal data transferred to the US (for further details, please see https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en).</li>
</ul>
<p>You have the right to ask us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place as mentioned above. Contact us as set out in Section 11 if you would like further information or to request a copy where the safeguard is documented (which may be redacted to ensure confidentiality).</p>
<h3><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Profiling</strong></h3>
<p><strong>'Automated Decision Making'</strong> refers to a decision which is taken through the automated processing of your personal data alone - this means processing using, for example, software code or an algorithm, which does not involve any human intervention..</p>
<h3><strong>8. How long do we keep your personal data?</strong></h3>
<p>We will retain your personal data for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes listed in Section 4 of this Policy</p>
<p>Where we are required to do so to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements, we will retain your personal data for longer periods of time, but only where permitted to do so, including so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a possibility of legal action relating to your personal data or dealings.</p>
<p>We maintain a data retention policy which we apply to records in our care. Where your personal data is no longer required and we do not have a legal requirement to retain it, we will ensure it is either securely deleted or stored in a way such that it is anonymised and the Personal Data is no longer used by the business.</p>
<h3>9<strong>.&nbsp;</strong><strong>What are your rights?</strong></h3>
<p>You have a number of rights in relation to your personal data. In summary, you have the right to request: access to your data; rectification of any mistakes in our files; erasure of records where no longer required; restriction on the processing of your data; objection to the processing of your data; data portability; and various information in relation to any automated decision making and profiling or the basis for international transfers.&nbsp; You also have the right to complain to your supervisory authority (further details of which are set out in Section 11 below).&nbsp;&nbsp; These are defined in more detail as follows:</p>
