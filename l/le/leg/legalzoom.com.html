        <p>LegalZoom is sensitive to your concerns about how we use the personal information we collect from you through LegalZoom's website (the "Site") and other plug-ins exchanging information with LegalZoom ("Applications"). (The Site and Applications are sometimes collectively referred to as "Online Services" for simplicity.) LegalZoom takes your privacy seriously, and has implemented this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") and internal policies and practices to keep your personal and financial information secure. The Privacy Policy covers LegalZoom's treatment of the Personally Identifiable Information we collect when you use the Online Services. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our <a href="terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="terms_of_service.html">Terms of Service</a>, and therefore governs your use of the Online Services. By using LegalZoom Online Services, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or concerns about the Privacy Policy, please contact Customer Care at (800) 773-0888.</p>

        <h2 class="bodyText_Header">What Information Do We Collect About Our Customers?</h2>
    
        <p><b>Traffic Data. </b>
        LegalZoom uses a number of internal and third-party methods to recognize visitor data like IP addresses and browser settings (collectively "Visitor Data"). The LegalZoom internal servers and software automatically recognize Visitor Data. No Personally Identifiable Information is revealed in this process. The Site may use Visitor Data to compile traffic data about the types of visitors who use the Site at specific intervals (collectively "Traffic Data").</p>
        <p>LegalZoom may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and third-party providers, or employ internally developed cookies and tracking codes, that allow LegalZoom to store a small piece of data on a visitor's computer, or any other device a visitor uses to access Online Services, about his or her visit to the Site 
            or use of Applications. LegalZoom does not capture Personally Identifiable Information in cookies or use cookies to mine Personally Identifiable Information.</p> 
        <p>We may use Traffic Data to analyze Site traffic, but this information is not examined for Personally Identifiable Information. We may also use Traffic Data to diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, or display content according to your preferences. Visitor Data and Traffic Data may also be shared with business partners, affiliates, or advertisers on an aggregated and anonymous basis.</p>

        <p><b>Personal Information.</b> 
        LegalZoom requires each customer to provide us with personal information (collectively "Personally Identifiable Information") to access and use LegalZoom products and services. Personally Identifiable Information is captured only when a visitor accesses 
            Online Services, or speaks on the phone with a LegalZoom employee, and willingly discloses that information. This disclosure may occur when a visitor registers 
            with an Online Service, engages in transactions, contacts customer service, or participates in contests, promotions, surveys, forums, content submissions, chats, bulletin boards, discussion groups, requests for suggestions, or other aspects of services offered by LegalZoom.</p>
        <p>Personally Identifiable Information includes: (i) "Contact Data" (such as your name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number, and email address); (ii) "Financial Data" (such as your credit card number, expiration date, and verification code); (iii) "Demographic Data" (such as your zip code and sex); and (iv) other "Legal Data" (such as your social security number, mortgage information, automobile information, marital information, trade secrets, inventions, and idea submissions and other sensitive information necessary to generate legal documents).</p>
        <p>Certain personal information becomes public record when documents are filed with the federal or state government, or with a court. For example, a corporation's name, business address, and registered agent name become public information when its articles of incorporation are filed. A Secretary of State may publish this information to its website or provide this information to third parties for a fee. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office publishes the names and addresses of trademark registrants. In some states, fictitious business names, including the name and address of the business owner, must be published in a newspaper. The LegalZoom Privacy Policy does not cover these or similar third-party actions.</p>

        <p><b>Calls/Electronic Communications.</b> 
        In the regular course of our business, LegalZoom may monitor and record phone conversations or email communications between you and LegalZoom employees for training and quality assurance purposes. We may receive a confirmation when you open or click on content in an email from us, which helps us make our communications to you more useful and interesting. If you do not wish to receive email from LegalZoom, you may unsubscribe from our mailing list on any of the emails we send.</p>  

        <h2 class="bodyText_Header">How Do We Use the Information We Collect and Do We Share the Information We Receive?</h2>

        <p>We use information we collect from the Online Services to communicate with you, process your orders, facilitate your transactions with our third-party marketing partners, and inform you of offers and discounts. For example, you may receive a welcome email that confirms your username and password, and later receive communications responding to your inquiries, providing services you request, and managing your account. We occasionally send service-related announcements, for example, to alert you if we need to temporarily suspend the Site for maintenance. We send promotional emails and newsletters from time to time to our purchasers and those who have opted in to receive such emails. Generally, you may not opt-out of service-related communications, which are not promotional. If you do not wish to receive service-related communications, you may terminate your account by contacting Customer Care at <a href="mailto:customercare@legalzoom.com">customercare@legalzoom.com</a> or (800) 773-0888.  However, you can opt-out of promotional communications by following the unsubscribe instructions in any communication or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:customercare@legalzoom.com">customercare@legalzoom.com</a>.</p>
     
        <p>We share customer information with third parties only as follows:</p>

        <p><b>Use of Personal Information.</b> 
        LegalZoom, sometimes with the assistance of a third party or LegalZoom subsidiary, may use your Personally Identifiable Information to process your payment through merchant account services, to generate the products and services you order, and to analyze our customer demographics. Your Contact Data may be used to follow up with you on transactions you initiate 
            through Online Services, respond to inquiries made through Online Services, inform you of changes to 
            Online Services, and send you additional information about LegalZoom and its products and services. Unless specifically authorized by you, we do not provide Personally Identifiable Information to third parties for marketing purposes. We may provide information to a third party in response to a subpoena or to otherwise comply with the law.</p>
        <p>Contact Data and Traffic Data are used to gather general statistics about our customers and visitors. We may use Demographic Data to generate collective information about our users, but not in a way that identifies any user specifically. For example, we may inform third parties about the number of registered users and unique visitors, and the pages most frequently browsed.</p>
        <p><b>Service Providers.</b> 
        We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with companies that provide support services to us (such as a printer or email service provider) or that help us market our products and services. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose.</p>
        <p><b>Opting Out.</b> 
        You may choose not to provide LegalZoom with Personally Identifiable Information or you may turn off cookies in your browser by changing its settings. If you make these decisions, you may continue to 
            use the Online Services and browse its pages. However, LegalZoom cannot process orders without Personally Identifiable Information. 
        </p><p>If you do not wish to receive promotional materials from LegalZoom, you may unsubscribe from our mailing list on any materials we send. Generally, you may not opt-out of service-related communications, which are not promotional. If you do not wish to receive service-related communications, you may terminate your account by contacting Customer Care at <a href="mailto:customercare@legalzoom.com">customercare@legalzoom.com</a> or (800) 773-0888.</p>
        <p>If you would like to learn more or opt out of receiving online display advertising tailored to your interests, please visit the Networking Advertising Initiative at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> or the Digital Advertising Alliance at <a href="http://aboutads.info/choices">http://aboutads.info/choices</a>. If you delete your cookies, use a different browser, or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your online display advertising opt-out choice.</p>

        <p><b>Website Areas Beyond LegalZoom's Control.</b> 
        The Site may include interactive forums, such as message boards and chat rooms. Any Personally Identifiable Information disclosed in these areas is public and becomes public information. You should use caution when deciding whether to disclose your personal information in these forums.</p>

        <p><b>Other Transfers.</b> 
        We may share Personally Identifiable Information and other data with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with LegalZoom. If LegalZoom is merged, acquired, or sold, or if some or all of our assets or equity are transferred, we may disclose or transfer Personally Identifiable Information and other data in connection with the associated transactions.</p>

        <p><b>Bankruptcy.</b> 
        In the event of a LegalZoom bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used. If such an event occurs, your Personally Identifiable Information may be treated like any other LegalZoom asset and sold, transferred, or shared with third parties, or used in ways not contemplated or permitted under this Privacy Policy, without notice to you or your consent. </p>

        <h2 class="bodyText_Header">Links</h2>

        <p><b>Third-Party Websites and Third-Party Service Providers.</b> 
        LegalZoom may maintain links to other websites and other websites may maintain links to the 
            Online Services. This Privacy Policy applies only to LegalZoom.com and not to other websites accessible from LegalZoom or that you use to access LegalZoom, each of which may have privacy policies materially different from this Privacy Policy. If you visit other websites, LegalZoom is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites. It is your responsibility to review the privacy policies of non-LegalZoom websites to confirm that you understand and agree with them.</p>
        <p>We may work with third-party service providers that we do not own or control. Unless authorized by you, we do not provide your Personally Identifiable Information to any third-party service providers, except as explained in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2 class="bodyText_Header">Accessing and Changing Your Account</h2>

        <p><b>User Access to Order Information. </b> 
        LegalZoom will give you, or anyone listed as an authorized contact for your account, information about your order. This may include information about the nature and status of your order, information you provided to process your order, payment information, and contact information. If you want someone to have access to your order, you must list them as an authorized contact or they may not obtain information. You can confirm who is listed as an authorized contact for your account, add new authorized contacts, or remove authorized contacts by clicking first on "My Account", and then on "Account Information". For some products, we may provide information about your order to other individuals named in the order, such as executors named in a last will. For product-specific information about who may request information about your order, please contact Customer Care at <a href="mailto:customercare@legalzoom.com">customercare@legalzoom.com</a> or (800) 773-0888. For some products, you may decide to share information about your order with a Legal Plan attorney. We will only share your information or documents with a Legal Plan attorney or with attorneys who service our attorney-assisted products with your authorization. We also may provide information to a third party in response to a subpoena or to otherwise comply with the law.</p>

        <p><b>User Access to and Ability to Update Personally Identifiable Information.</b> 
        You may visit your personal account profile at any time by clicking on the "My Account" link, which will take you to the following URL: <a href="https://www.legalzoom.com/welcome/signin.asp">www.legalzoom.com/welcome/signin.asp</a>. Through My Account, you may: (i) review and update your Contact Data; (ii) complete pending orders; and (iii) begin new orders. If you want to remove your Personally Identifiable Information from our Site, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:customercare@legalzoom.com">customercare@legalzoom.com</a>. LegalZoom may maintain some or all of this data in its archives even after it has been removed from the Site.</p>

        <h2 class="bodyText_Header">How Secure Is the Personal Information We Collect?</h2>
        <p><b>Our Commitment to Data Security.</b> 
        We strive to make certain that our servers and connections incorporate the latest encryption and security devices. We have implemented physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. Credit card and personal information are transmitted by secure servers. Documents are delivered to you via UPS or similar overnight delivery services, the United States Postal Service, or email. Unfortunately, no data transmission is guaranteed to be 100% secure and we therefore cannot guarantee the security of information you transmit to or from the Site, Applications, or through the use of our services, and you provide this information at your own risk. ACCORDINGLY, WE DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR THE THEFT, LOSS, OR INTERCEPTION OF, OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR DAMAGE TO, YOUR DATA OR COMMUNICATIONS BY USING THE SITE, APPLICATIONS, AND OUR SERVICES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND ASSUME THESE RISKS.</p>
        
        <p><b>IF YOU BELIEVE YOUR PRIVACY HAS BEEN BREACHED THROUGH USE OF OUR WEBSITE, 
            APPLICATIONS, OR OTHER SERVICES PLEASE CONTACT US IMMEDIATELY AT (800) 773-0888. </b></p>
