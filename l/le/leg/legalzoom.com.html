	<p>In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.</p>
	<h2>LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><span class="text-color">If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.</span></li>
		<li><span class="text-color">If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.</span></li>
		<li><span class="text-color">Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.</span></li>
		<li class="last-child"><span class="text-color">Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.</span></li>

<h2 class="terms-header">Privacy Policy</h2>
</div>
<div class="sfContentBlock">
<p>LegalZoom.com, Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp; (“LegalZoom” “We”, “Us”) is sensitive to your concerns about how we use the personal information we collect from you and about you. LegalZoom takes your privacy seriously, and has implemented this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") and internal policies and practices to keep your personal and financial information secure. The Privacy Policy covers LegalZoom's treatment of the Personally Identifiable Information we collect about you.&nbsp; It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.legalzoom.com/legal/general-terms/terms-of-use" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.legalzoom.com/legal/general-terms/terms-of-service" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>, and therefore governs your use of the Online Services. By using LegalZoom Online Services, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or concerns about the Privacy Policy, please contact Customer Care at <a href="mailto:customercare@legalzoom.com">customercare@legalzoom.com</a>.</p>
<p><span><span><span>This Privacy Policy does not cover information that you may provide in connection with your use of LegalZoom’s Identity Protection or Business Data Protection services.&nbsp; Instead, the information that you provide in connection with those services are governed by the <a href="https://www.csid.com/privacy-policy/">Experian Privacy Policy</a>, as described at time of activation.&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<h2>What Information Do We Collect About Our Customers?</h2>
<p><strong>Traffic Data.</strong>&nbsp;LegalZoom may collect a variety of visitor data such as IP addresses, browser settings, internet service provider (ISP) information, referring/exit pages, operating systems, date/time stamps, and clickstream data (collectively "Visitor Data"). The LegalZoom internal servers and software automatically recognize Visitor Data. LegalZoom's website (the "Site") may use Visitor Data to compile traffic data about the types of visitors who use the Site at specific intervals (collectively "Traffic Data").</p>
<p>We may use Traffic Data to analyze Site traffic, but this information is not examined for Personally Identifiable Information. We may also use Traffic Data to diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, or display content according to your preferences. Visitor Data and Traffic Data may also be shared with business partners, affiliates, or advertisers on an aggregated and anonymous basis.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies.</strong>&nbsp; LegalZoom and its partners may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and third-party providers, including Google Analytics features (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting), or employ internally developed cookies and tracking codes, that allow LegalZoom to store a small piece of data on a visitor's computer, or any other device a visitor uses to access Online Services, about his or her visit to the Site or use of other plug-ins exchanging information with LegalZoom ("Applications").&nbsp; (The Site and Applications are sometimes collectively referred to as "Online Services" for simplicity.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span><span>Similar technologies, such as java scripts or etags, are also used to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such order forms, will be limited.</p>
<p><span><span><span>To manage Flash cookies, please click here: </span></span></span><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html"><span><span>www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</span></span></a></p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons</strong>.&nbsp; We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons), that help us track referrals from our partners and affiliates and better manage content on our site.&nbsp; Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p><strong>3rd Party Tracking.</strong>&nbsp; The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other 3rd party assets (such as social media links) on the site is not covered by our Privacy Policy.&nbsp; These 3rd parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our site.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not have access or control over these technologies.&nbsp; We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information.</strong>&nbsp;LegalZoom requires each customer to provide us with personal information (collectively "Personally Identifiable Information") to access and use LegalZoom products and services. Personally Identifiable Information is captured when a visitor accesses Online Services, or speaks on the phone with a LegalZoom employee, and willingly discloses that information. This disclosure may occur when a visitor registers with an Online Service, engages in transactions, contacts customer service, or participates in contests, promotions, surveys, forums, content submissions, requests for suggestions, or other aspects of services offered by LegalZoom.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information includes but is not limited to: (i) "Contact Data" (such as your name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number, and email address); (ii) "Financial Data" (such as your credit card number, expiration date, and verification code or bank account information); (iii) "Demographic Data" (such as your zip code and sex); and (iv) other "Legal Data" (such as your social security number, EIN number,&nbsp;mortgage information, automobile information, marital information, trade secrets, inventions, and idea submissions and other sensitive information necessary to generate legal documents).</p>
<p><span><span><span>We may also receive information about our customers or potential customers from other sources, including from employers who have purchased our products on behalf of their employees</span></span></span><span><span><span>, from publicly available sources, and through other commercially available sources of information</span></span></span><span><span><span>.&nbsp; In some instances we may combine this data with information we already have or that we later receive from our customers.&nbsp; This helps us to update, expand, and analyze our records, and to provide better service to our customers and potential customers.&nbsp; Other than information obtained from publicly available sources, we will only use this information for the specific reasons that it was provided to us, which may include marketing related uses.&nbsp; Examples of the types of Personally Identifiable Information that we may receive from third parties include Contact Data and Legal Data.</span></span></span></p>
<p>We may collect information from you about third&nbsp;party individuals in order to provide you service.&nbsp; For example, we may ask you for information about the beneficiaries in your will, shareholders of a company, or authorized contacts to access your LegalZoom account.&nbsp; <strong>LegalZoom uses this information for the sole purpose of administering services to you, and does not use such information for any other reason.</strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>If you are not a LegalZoom customer but believe that LegalZoom has your personal information that you would like to be deleted, please contact us at </span></span></span><a href="mailto:customercare@legalzoom.com">customercare@legalzoom.com</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span><span>If you are a LegalZoom customer, please refer to the section “Accessing and Changing Your Account” for information about accessing and deleting your account.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Certain personal information becomes public record when documents are filed with the federal or state government, or with a court. For example, a corporation's name, business address, and registered agent name become public information when its articles of incorporation are filed. A Secretary of State may publish this information to its website or provide this information to third parties for a fee. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office publishes the names and addresses of trademark registrants. In some states, fictitious business names, including the name and address of the business owner, must be published in a newspaper. The LegalZoom Privacy Policy does not cover these or similar third-party actions.</p>
<p><strong>Testimonials and Reviews.</strong>&nbsp; We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers received through email surveys.&nbsp; We ask for your specific consent as part of the survey.&nbsp; If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:customercare@legalzoom.com">customercare@legalzoom.com</a>.&nbsp; We also display customer reviews.&nbsp; If you provide a review that we display and wish to update or delete it, you can also contact us at <a href="mailto:customercare@legalzoom.com">customercare@legalzoom.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Calls/Electronic Communications.</strong>&nbsp;In the regular course of our business, LegalZoom may monitor and record phone conversations or email communications between you and LegalZoom employees for training and quality assurance purposes. We may receive a confirmation when you open or click on content in an email from us, which helps us make our communications to you more useful and interesting. If you do not wish to receive email from LegalZoom, you may unsubscribe from our mailing list by using the "Unsubscribe" link on any of the emails we send.</p>
<h2>How Do We Use the Information We Collect and Do We Share the Information We Receive?</h2>
<p>We use information we collect to communicate with you, process your orders, facilitate your transactions with our third-party marketing partners, for research into how to improve our product offerings, and inform you of offers and discounts. For example, you may receive a welcome email that confirms your username and password, and later receive communications responding to your inquiries, providing services you request, and managing your account. We occasionally send service-related announcements, for example, to alert you if we need to temporarily suspend the Site for maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Opting Out.</strong>&nbsp; We send promotional emails and newsletters from time to time to users who have registered on the site and to those who have opted in to receive such emails. Generally, you may not opt-out of service-related or transactional communications, which are not promotional. If you do not wish to receive service-related communications, you may terminate your account by contacting Customer Care at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:customercare@legalzoom.com">customercare@legalzoom.com</a>&nbsp;or (800) 773-0888. However, you can opt-out of promotional communications by using the "Unsubscribe" link and following the unsubscribe instructions in any electronic communication or by emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:customercare@legalzoom.com">customercare@legalzoom.com</a>.</p>
<p>You may choose not to provide LegalZoom with Personally Identifiable Information or you may turn off cookies in your browser by changing its settings. If you make these decisions, you may continue to use the Online Services and browse its pages. However, LegalZoom cannot process orders without Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p><strong>Surveys, Sweepstakes, and Contests</strong>.&nbsp; We may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site, to measure customer satisfaction.&nbsp; If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys, sweepstakes, or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.&nbsp; The requested information typically includes name, email address, and mailing address.</p>
<p><span><span><span>We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site, and/or to send participants an email newsletter.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personal information for any other purpose. We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>We share customer information with third parties only as follows:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Order Processing.</strong>&nbsp;LegalZoom, sometimes with the assistance of a third party or LegalZoom subsidiary, may use your Personally Identifiable Information to process your payment through merchant account services, and to generate the products and services you order.&nbsp; Your Contact Data may be used to follow up with you on transactions you initiate, respond to inquiries, inform you of changes to Online Services, and send you additional information about LegalZoom and its products and services.</p>
<p><strong>Registered Agent Requests.</strong> If you designate a person or company other than LegalZoom to serve as the registered agent for your business entity, LegalZoom may provide your name and contact information to that party, if the designee requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Marketing. </strong>Unless specifically authorized by you, we do not provide Personally Identifiable Information to third parties for their marketing purposes. If you express interest in a third party offer, we may provide your Personally Identifiable Information to that third party solely in connection with the offer you have selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to sharing your Contact Data, we may also share details regarding your purchase from LegalZoom, as well as your Financial, Demographic, or Legal Data with these third parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span><span>If you later decide to opt-out from allowing LegalZoom to share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their marketing purposes, you may do so by contacting Customer Care at&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><a href="mailto:customercare@legalzoom.com"><span><span><span><span>customercare@legalzoom.com</span></span></span></span></a></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;or (800) 773-0888.&nbsp; To the extent that LegalZoom has already shared your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their marketing purposes prior to your decision to opt-out, you may opt out from future marketing by contacting the Third Parties directly.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Required by Law. </strong>We may also disclose your personal information: as required by law, such as in response to a subpoena, a lawful request by a public authority, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a legal request.</p>
<p><strong>Visitor Demographics. </strong>Contact Data and Traffic Data are used to gather general statistics about our customers and visitors. We may use Demographic Data to generate collective information about our users, but not in a way that identifies any user specifically. For example, we may inform third parties about the number of registered users and unique visitors, and the pages most frequently browsed.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Plan Attorneys and Attorney-Assisted Products. </strong>As a convenience to you and your attorney, we may share your Personally Identifiable Information, information about your order, and your order history with your legal plan attorneys and with attorneys who service our attorney-assisted products. We will notify you prior to sharing this information and, where the information is not necessary to complete your order, give you the opportunity to opt-out. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers.</strong>&nbsp;We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with companies that provide support services to us (such as a printer or email service provider), help us market our products and services, or for training purposes. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Business Partners.</strong>&nbsp; <span><span><span>When you purchase a product from us that is bundled with a product offered by one of our business partners, we will share your Personally Identifiable Information with those business partners so that they can provide you with the product or services included with your purchase.&nbsp; These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them about you for their own marketing purposes without first asking for your permission.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Partner and Affiliate Tracking. </strong>Our partners and affiliates, including Google Analytics (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics and Interest Reporting), may use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. This means that these partners and affiliates may show our ads on sites across the Internet based upon your previous visits to our site. Together with our partners and affiliates, we may use these cookies and web beacons to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to your visits to our site.&nbsp;</p>
