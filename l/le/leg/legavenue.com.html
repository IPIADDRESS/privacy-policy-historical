      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	  <p>It is Leg Avenue’s policy to protect and maintain the confidentiality of personal information provided to it by those who visit or use this web site. To that end, we have adopted the following security and privacy provisions. By visiting www.legavenue.com, you are accepting the practices described in this policy notice.</p>
      <h3>Information Collected<br>
        </h3>
      <p>Your IP address, browser and reference site domain name are logged every time you visit our web site. This data is used strictly for the analysis of load information and maximizing the efficiency of our servers. Except as provided in this privacy policy, we will not share this data with anyone in any way.</p>
      <h3>Ordering from Leg Avenue<br>
        </h3>
      <p>We collect information from you when you place an order or respond to a survey or communication such as e-mail. When ordering, we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, mailing address, daytime phone number, credit card information or other information. Leg Avenue automatically collects order information.</p>
      <h3>Use of Personal Information<br>
        </h3>
      <p>Leg Avenue uses the personal information that it collects to provide customer service and support. In some cases, we are required to disclose personal information to our vendors so that they can ship products that you ordered through our web site. Our vendors are required to keep that information confidential and are precluded from disclosing it to third parties and from using it for any purpose other than order fulfillment. Leg Avenue does not otherwise share, sell, or provide any other parties with any customer information unless it has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with judicial proceedings, court order, or other legal process.<br>
        Leg Avenue may use the personal information that it collects to send promotional or informational e-mail to its customers and/or users. You will be given the choice to opt-out if and when Leg Avenue conducts such e-mailings.</p>
      <h3>Security<br>
        </h3>
      <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. Personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. All sensitive/credit information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases to be accessed only as stated above.</p>
      <h3>Cookies<br>
        </h3>
      <p>Like many websites, we use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a site sends to your computer while you are viewing the site. Cookies work in combination with content within the site itself to capture and remember information. For instance, cookies are used to remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to track your activity and understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity. This enables us to provide you with services or to improve your site experience. We also use cookies to provide us with aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
      <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. Please note, however, that if you disable cookies our web site may not perform as intended and may not meet your expectations.</p>

        </h3>
      <p>You should be aware that when you are on Leg Avenue, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There may be links to other sites that take you outside our service. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information that is beyond our control. Please pay attention to your location on the web and note that we are only responsible for information collected within our own web site.</p>
      <h3>Changes to Privacy Policy<br>
        </h3>
