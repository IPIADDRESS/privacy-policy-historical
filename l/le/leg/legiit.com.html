	<h3>Legiit's Privacy Policy</h3>
	<label>Last Update: May 2018</label>
	<p class="text-justify">
		Please read this privacy policy (the&nbsp;“Policy”) carefully to understand how we use your personal information. If you do not agree with this Policy, your choice is not to use Legiit.com (the&nbsp;“Site”). By accessing or using this Site, you agree to this Policy. This Policy may change from time to time. If there are any material changes to how your personal information is used, we will notify you. Your continued use of the Site after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the Policy periodically for update.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h4>The Short Version</h4>
	<br>
	<p>At Legiit we care about your privacy. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We do not disclose it to others except as disclosed in this Policy or required to provide you with the services of the Site and mobile applications, meaning - to allow you to buy, sell, share the information you want to share on the Site; to contribute on the forum; pay for products; post reviews and so on; or where we have a legal obligation to do so.</p>	
	<p>We collect information that you provide us or voluntarily share with other users, and also some general technical information that is automatically gathered by our systems, such as IP address, browser information and cookies to enable you to have a better user experience and a more personalized browsing experience.</p>
	<p>We will not share information that you provide us in the process of the registration - including your contact information - except as described in this Policy.</p>
	<p>Information that you choose to publish on the Site (photos, videos, text, music, reviews, deliveries) - is no longer private, just like any information you publish online.</p>
	<p>Technical information that is gathered by our systems, or third party systems, automatically may be used for Site operation, optimization, analytics, content promotion and enhancement of user experience. We may use your information to contact you - to provide notices related to your activities, or offer you promotions and general updates, but we will not let any other person, including sellers and buyers, contact you, other than through your user profile on the Site.</p>
	<p>Your personal information may be stored in systems based around the world, and may be processed by third party service providers acting on our behalf. These providers may be based in countries that do not provide an equivalent level of protection for privacy as that enjoyed in the country in which you live. In that case, we will provide for adequate safeguards to protect your personal information.You can exercise your rights over your personal information, by opening a&nbsp;Customer Relations ticket. If you do not have an active Legiit account, please contact us at&nbsp;<a class="text-dark" href="mailto:support@legiit.com">support@legiit.com</a>. More details about the rights applicable to you are in the long version of the Policy.</p>
	<p>The above are just the highlights. We encourage you to read more about the information we collect, how we use it, understand the meaning of cookie (no, you can’t eat it) and more in the long version of our Policy below.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>The Longer Version</h4>
	<br>
	<p>Legiit (including Legiit Inc., Legiit International Ltd. and its affiliates) respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information of its users - buyers, sellers, and visitors browsing the Site (“Users”). We believe that you have a right to know our practices regarding the information we may collect when you visit and/or use the Site. This Policy explains our privacy practices for the Site and services provided by Legiit.

	<p>When you register to the Site we ask you to provide certain personal information, including a valid email address, location, facebook or google account log in details and username. We may collect additional information such as physical address, telephone number or other contact details and additional authentication information, to provide you with the services you need (such as payment or withdrawal of funds, sending physical goods), or to ensure the marketplace integrity (for example, prevention of fraud).</p>
	<p>In addition, we collect information while you access, browse, view or otherwise use the Site. In other words, when you access the Site we are aware of your usage of the Site, and may gather, collect and record the information relating to such usage, including geo-location information, IP address, device and connection information, browser information and web-log information, and all communications recorded by Users through the Site. We use that information to enhance user experience, personalize your browsing experience as well as monitor the Site for preventing fraud and inappropriate content or behaviour. We may also collect supplemental information obtained from third parties such as demographic and navigation data.</p>
	<p>Additionally, in order to improve your online experience at Legiit, we have implemented impression reporting.

This information includes photos you upload, your published portfolio, Gig information, ratings, and additional information you may choose to add to your profile.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>How do we collect Information?</h4>
	<br>
	<p>You directly provide us with most of the information we collect. You do this by filling out the registration details on the Site, and by posting and sharing additional information voluntarily. This can include information about sellers and their Gigs, User's location, sharing of portfolio, ratings and feedbacks by buyers and anything you choose to add to your user profile. We also collect technical information indirectly and automatically through our systems.

Cookies ultimately help us improve your navigation and ease of use of our Site. You can find further information about Cookies in this Policy below, under "Cookies". We may also collect information from commercially available sources such as data aggregators and public databases.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>How do we use the Information collected?</h4>
	<br>
	<p>Where relevant under applicable laws, all processing of your personal information will be justified by a "condition" for processing. In the majority of cases, processing will be justified on the basis that:</p>
	<ul class="text-justify">
		<li>1) you have provided your consent for us to use your personal information for a specific purpose;</li>
		<li>2) our use of your personal information is necessary to perform a contract or take steps to enter into a contract with you (e.g. to provide you with services which you have purchased);</li>
		<li>3) the processing is necessary to comply with a relevant legal obligation or regulatory obligation that we have (e.g. fraud prevention); or</li>
		<li>4) the processing is necessary to support our legitimate interests as a business (e.g. to improve our services to you or to customise your browsing experience), subject to your interests and fundamental rights and provided it is conducted at all times in a way that is proportionate.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We will use your personal information for the following purposes:</p>
	<ul class="text-justify">
		<li>1) to provide you with quality service and security. For example, we may use the information collected from you to verify your identity. We may also use this information to establish and set up your account, verify or re-issue a password, log your activity and contact you from time to time. The information helps us improve our services to you and customize your browsing experience. In addition, this information helps us track any fraudulent activities and other inappropriate activities and monitor content integrity; or</li>
		<li>2) to maintain appropriate business records, to comply with lawful requests by public authorities and to comply with applicable laws and regulations or as otherwise required by law. Should you ever deactivate your account with us, we will keep your information for a limited period in order to meet the above purposes.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those set out in this Policy.</p>
	<p>Direct marketing:</p>
	<ul class="text-justify">
		<li>1) We may use your personal information to send you direct marketing communications about our products, services or promotions from Legiit that may be of interest to you or our related services. This may be via email, post, SMS, telephone or targeted online advertisements.</li>
		<li>2) In most cases our processing of your personal information for marketing purposes is based on our legitimate interest, although some cases (such as where required by law) may be based on your consent. You have a right to prevent direct marketing of any form at any time - this can be exercised by following the opt-out link attached to each communication or by sending an email to&nbsp;<a class="text-dark" href="mailto:support@legiit.com">support@legiit.com</a>.</li>
		<li> We take steps to limit direct marketing to a reasonable and proportionate level, and to send you communications which we believe may be of interest or relevance to you, based on the information we have about you.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h4>How long do we keep your information?</h4>
	<br>
	<p>We apply a general rule of keeping personal information only for as long as is required to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected. However, in some circumstances we may retain your personal information for longer periods of time. We may retain your information for the following purposes:</p>

	<p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.</p>
	<p>We may combine your personal information with information we collect automatically or obtain from other companies and use it to improve and personalize our services, content and advertising. If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us, you can opt-out through the link attached to each communication or by sending an email to&nbsp;<a class="text-dark" href="mailto:support@legiit.com">support@legiit.com</a></p>
	<p>We may provide your personal details to third parties, only in order to operate the Site, provide our services to you, fulfil obligations imposed on us by applicable laws and regulations, and prevent fraud and illegal activities, as detailed below:</p>
	<ul class="text-justify">
		<li>1) to service providers for the purpose of opening and operating your account as well as providing ancillary services (example - payment vendors, CRM systems, forum hosting, community management services, mailing systems or technical consultants). Our contracts with these service providers do not permit use of your information for their own (marketing) purposes. Consistent with applicable legal requirements, we take commercially reasonable steps to require third parties to adequately safeguard your personal information and only process it in accordance with our instructions;</li>
		<li>2) to respond to a subpoena or court order, judicial process or to regulatory authorities, if we believe we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes; when we believe it necessary or appropriate to disclose personal information to law enforcement authorities, such as to investigate actual or suspected fraud or violations of law, breaches of security, or breaches of this Policy; to respond to claims against us; and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Legiit, our customers, or the public;</li>
		<li>3) to secure the site and protect it against fraud, unauthorized transactions (such as money laundering), claims or other liabilities. We do not collect credit information; but allow our payment vendors to collect information for the purpose of collecting payments from buyers on the Site or transferring payments to sellers on the Site. We are not exposed to the payment information provided to our payment vendors, and this information is subject to the privacy policy applicable to the payment vendor; and</li>
		<li>4) your personal information may be disclosed if we go through a business transition such as a merger, sale, transfer of all or a portion of Legiit's assets, acquisition, bankruptcy or similar event.</li>
	</ul>
