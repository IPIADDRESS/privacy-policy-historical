  <span class="s1"><strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong></span>
</p>
<p class="p18">
  <span class="s1">You have the right to:</span>
</p>
<p class="p19">
  <span class="s1"><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal
  data (commonly known as a ‘data subject access
  request’).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> This
  enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about
  you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</span>
</p>
<p class="p19">
  <span class="s1"><strong>Request correction</strong> of the
  personal data that we hold about you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> This enables you to have
  any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected,
  though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you
  provide to us.</span>
</p>
<p class="p19">
  <span class="s1"><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your
  personal data.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
  This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data
  where there is no good reason for us continuing to process
  it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> You also
  have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data
  where you have successfully exercised your right to object to
  processing (see below), where we may have processed your
  information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your
  personal data to comply with local law.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> Note, however, that we may
  not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for
  specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if
  applicable, at the time of your request.</span>
</p>
<p class="p19">
  <span class="s1"><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your
  personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or
  those of a third party) and there is something about your
  particular situation which makes you want to object to processing
  on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights
  and freedoms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
  You also have the right to object where we are processing your
  personal data for direct marketing purposes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> In some cases, we may
  demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process
  your information which override your rights and freedoms.</span>
</p>
<p class="p19">
  <span class="s1"><strong>Request restriction of
  processing</strong> of your personal data.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> This enables you to ask us
  to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following
  scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;
  (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us
  to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no
  longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend
  legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data
  but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate
  grounds to use it.</span>
</p>
<p class="p19">
  <span class="s1"><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your
  personal data to you or to a third party.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> We will provide to you, or
  a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a
  structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> Note that this right only
  applies to automated information which you initially provided
  consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform
  an Agreement with you.</span>
</p>
<p class="p8">
  <span class="s1"><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong>
  where we are relying on consent to process your personal
  data.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> However,
  this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out
  before you withdraw your consent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> If you withdraw your
  consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or
  services to you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
  We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw
  your consent.</span>
