<p><a name="1"></a><b>1. What information do we collect from you? </b>
</p><p>In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, the Site 
collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable 
Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in 
collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and 
customized experience while using the Site. The Online Store collects 
information on behalf of Lexmark International, Inc.. 
</p><p><b>Personally Identifiable Information:</b> This refers to information that 
lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested 
when you order a product or service, enter contests or sweepstakes, fill out 
surveys, and correspond with us. This information might include your name, 
mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address or credit card number (only if 
you choose to purchase a product online). With this information, we can fill 
your service and product orders and better provide you with personalized 
services. 
</p><p><b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</b> This refers to information 
that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain 
information about you based upon where you shop on the Site in several ways. 
This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated 
basis. This information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator 
("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are 
using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of 
documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an 
identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet 
Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP 
protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In 
other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your 
computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and 
identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to 
communicate on the Internet, browse and shop. 
</p><p><a name="2"></a><b>2. Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it? </b>
</p><p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide our 
visitors with a superior customized online experience. We use the customer 
contact information to fill orders, contact prior purchasers to inform them of 
their order status and to send promotional e-mails. 
</p><p>We may perform statistical analyses of aggregate customer behavior. This 
allows us to measure relative customer interest in the various areas of the Site 
for product development purposes. Any information we collect is used for our own 
internal purposes to improve the content of the Site, to enhance users' 
experiences when visiting the Site, to customize the content and/or layout of 
our pages, and to provide the services required by an individual customer. 
</p><p>We gather information in the following ways: 
</p><ul><b>Shopping:</b> We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system 
  administration, to gather broad demographic information, and to monitor the 
  level of activity on the Site. We collect information from visitors to the 
  Site regarding the referring URL, your IP address, which browser you used to 
  come to the Site, the country, state, the pages of the Site that you viewed 
  during your visit and any search terms entered on the Site. 
  <p><b>Ordering:</b> When you order from us, we collect personally identifiable 
  information from you. If you order one of our products or services, we will 
  collect and maintain your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone 
  number, product selections, credit card number, order number, referring URL, 
  IP address and a password. We collect this, and other information, as 
  disclosed in this Policy, in order to fill your order, to communicate with you 
  about your order and to send you promotional materials. Before confirming your 
  order, you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make 
  changes and additions to the information it contains and these changes will be 
  automatically kept for future use. 
  </p><p><b>Online Surveys and Polling:</b> In order to improve our services to you, 
  we ask some of our customers to voluntarily complete surveys, which may be 
  collected by an independent third party. Individual survey answers are 
  confidential, although Non-Personally Identifiable Information is collected 
  and disclosed to third parties. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, 
  simply decline to participate when asked. 
  </p><p><b>Contests and Sweepstakes:</b> When you enter a contest or other 
  promotion, we may ask you for contact information such as your name, mailing 
  address and e-mail address in order to administer the contest, to send you 
  promotional e-mails, notify winners and make the winners' list publicly 
  available pursuant to certain states' laws. 
  </p><p><b>Newsletters, Product Updates, &amp; Promotional E-mails:</b> We may 
  offer free electronic newsletters, product updates, and promotional e-mails as 
  a service to our prior customers. We may send you newsletters and e-mails 
  periodically listing current specials, promotions, and deals. In addition, 
  there may be other opportunities to subscribe to an e-mail list that will send 
  you information about the Site events, but we will only add you to the list 
  with your consent. We will not send e-mails to you if you have requested us 
  not to do so unless we need to confirm for our records that you do not want to 
  receive promotional emails. This option is usually included in your account 
  registration form or at our optional home page registration form. If you have 
  established an account with us, to stop receiving promotional emails and 
  newsletters in the future, please go to the <a href="editaccountlogin.asp">account page</a> and log in 
  with your account information. Once you are logged in you may scroll to the 
  bottom of the page and un-check the opt-in box. Then click the 'Update 
  Account' button and you will be removed from our mailing list. If you have not 
  set up an account with us, but have previously registered at our home page to 
  receive future information, you may unsubscribe by sending a blank email to the 
  unsubscribe address specified at the bottom of the email you receive to let us know 
  you do not wish us to sent future newsletters, updates or promotional emails to you.
    </p><p><b>Cookies:</b> We use cookies in the operation of the Site. To find out 
  what cookies are and how we use them, <a href="cookies.asp">click here</a>. 
  </p><p><b>Contact Information and Third Party Data:</b> If you contact us by 
  telephone, e-mail or letter, we may keep a record of your correspondence or 
  comments. If you report a problem with the Site, we may collect such 
  information in a file specific to you in order to troubleshoot problems, 
  resolve disputes and better serve your needs. If you contact us through our 
  feedback area or by calling one of our customer service representatives, we 
  ask for your name and e-mail address in order to send you a reply. If other 
  users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or 
  purchases on the Site, we may keep the information in a file specific to you. 
  </p><p><b>Customer Traffic Patterns:</b> We track customers' traffic patterns 
  throughout their online sessions, including which pages a customer views while 
  using the Site. This information is ultimately stored in the form of store 
  categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs. We use your IP address to 
  diagnose problems with our servers and software and to administer the Site. 
  </p><p>We may share aggregated statistics about pages viewed on the Site and sales 
  and other shopping information with third parties. 
  </p><p><b>Warranty Information</b> 
  </p><p>From time to time we may offer additional or extended warranty or service 
  programs on our Site. These programs are often administered by third party 
  warranty and service companies. When you purchase a warranty, we pass along your name, 
  address, telephone number, e-mail address, warranty purchased and information about the 
  product purchased to the warranty company. </p></ul>
<p><a name="3"></a><b>3. With whom do we share your information? </b>
</p><p>The information collected by the Site is used only for the limited purposes 
of processing orders, keeping you informed about your order status, for 
statistical purposes for improving the Site and to notify you of products or 
special offers that may be of interest to you. We will disclose your Personally 
Identifiable Information to third parties to charge your credit card, fill your 
order, deliver your order, provide customer service to you, and deliver 
promotional e-mails to you from us. For example, we must release your credit 
card number to confirm payment; and release your mailing address information to 
the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered. These third parties 
have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may 
not use it for other purposes. 
</p><p>We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. We may 
release account information when we believe that such release is reasonably 
necessary to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, 
property and safety of our users, others and ourselves. In addition, we may 
assign or otherwise transfer to a third party certain of your information in 
connection with an assignment, sale, transfer or disposition of a portion or all 
of our business, assets, or stock. 
</p><p>Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, at present we do not disclose our 
customers' Personally Identifiable Information to other merchants. In the 
future, with your prior permission, we may provide some customer information to 
companies with products or services that may be of interest to you. This would 
be for marketing purposes only and no credit card number information would be 
given. Before agreeing to release your information, you should first confirm 
that our partner's privacy policy is acceptable to you because once your data is 
released, we would have no further control over it. 
</p><p>From time to time, we may be required by law enforcement or judicial 
authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate 
governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information 
upon receipt of a court order or subpoena or to cooperate with a law enforcement 
investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying 
those who use our services for illegal activities. As expressed in the <a href="copyright.asp">Terms and Conditions</a> that govern 
this Site, we reserve the right to conduct an investigation and/or report to law 
enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be 
unlawful. 
</p><p>We may assign or otherwise transfer to a third party certain of your 
information in connection with an assignment, sale, transfer or disposition of a 
portion or all of our business, assets, or stock. 
</p><p><a name="4"></a><b>4. How can you update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information?</b> 
</p><p>During the online ordering process you can review, change or delete the 
information that you have submitted. You may change any of your personal 
information in your account online at any time. Simply go to the <a href="editaccountlogin.asp">account page</a> and log in 
with your account information. Once you are logged in you may update your 
account. Then click on "Update Account". We encourage you to promptly update 
your information if it changes. You may ask to have some or all of your account 
information deleted or removed. Upon such a request by you, we will delete as 
much of your account information as possible. However, because we keep track of 
all past purchases, not all information related to past purchases will be 
completely removed from our databases due to legal obligations. 
</p><p><a name="5"></a><b>5. What are your choices regarding collection, use and distribution of your information? </b>
</p><p>With your consent, we may from time to time send you e-mail or other 
communications regarding current promotions, specials and new additions to the 
Site. You may "opt-out," or unsubscribe from our newsletters, updates, and 
promotions, by following the unsubscribe instructions in any e-mail you receive 
from us. You may also unsubscribe by going to the <a href="editaccountlogin.asp">account page</a>  
and logging in with your account information. Once you are logged in you may scroll to the bottom of 
the page and un-check the opt-in box. Then click on 'Update Account' and you will not receive any further communications or mailings.

</p><p><a name="6"></a><b>6. What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your information?</b>
</p><p>We employ the industry-recognized information technology to protect the 
security of the information you submit to us. The importance of security for all 
Personally Identifiable Information associated with our customers is of utmost 
concern to us. Our secure servers protect the information using advanced 
encryption and firewall technology. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology 
for mutual authentication, data encryption and data integrity -  all to ensure 
secure transactions for our customers. SSL is the industry standard security 
protocol to encode sensitive information, such as your credit card number. 
</p><p>In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order 
fulfillment are handled by established third party banking, process agents and 
distribution institutions. They receive the information they need to verify and 
authorize your credit card transactions and to ship your order. When collecting 
credit card information for online purchases, we offer secured-server

</p><p>Like many other commercial sites, our site may utilize a standard technology 
called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site is used. A cookie is 
a small data text file, which a Web site stores on your computer's hard drive 
(if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. 
Cookies were designed to help a Web site recognize a user's browser as a 
previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been 
set while the user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot be read by a Web site 
other than the one that set the cookie. Cookies can securely store a customer's 
password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been 
visited or keep track of selections, such as those selected in a "shopping 
cart." Our cookies may collect your domain name and track your selections 
through the Site. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, 
pass on a computer virus, or capture your e-mail address. The cookies make your 
use of the Site easier, make the Site run more smoothly and help us to maintain 
a secure Site. You will be unable to shop on the Site without your browser set 
to accept cookies. We only use cookies to gather the information indicated in 
this policy and do not use cookies to gather personal identifying information 
about you without your consent.
