  <h3 class="line2bot">Effective date: February 17, 2010</h3>
  <div class="article_wrap fullwidth">
    <p class="mtop0">Trust is a major part of doing business with an organization.  We value your trust and appreciate your business, and that is why we protect your personal information to the best of our ability.  The goal of this Privacy Statement is to share and clarify what data we collect, the information we use, and what we share with others.  We also wish to disclose what your personal choices are pertaining to privacy matters.  Please read our Privacy Statement so that you have a clear understanding of how we operate.</p>
    <h3>The Information Leisure.com Collects</h3>
    <p>When website browsers visit Leisure.com, information is included by us or our venders, in order to provide users with personalized products and services or with promotions and offers of interest to you.  This information is also used to service your account, and help us to efficiently respond to all of your needs.</p>
    <p>At Leisure.com we follow the typical online business practice of utilizing “Cookies.”  We use this technology to gather statistical data in order to improve customer service and overall customer experience.  Cookies help Leisure.com recognize you by name, save passwords as desired, and allow visitors to utilize shopping carts.  Cookies are also used to generate a list of programs, services, and products based on your personal preferences.  If you do not wish to provide Leisure.com with personal identifiable information, your cookie data will not be linked to your account.<br>
      Statistical data may also be collected as you brose Leisure.com sites by us or our vendors.  IP Addresses are typically collected in order to determine browser type, operating system, average amount of time spent on our sites, search behavior, pages viewed, times site was accessed, and other relevant information on user experience.</p>
    <p>Web Beacons are used to produce offers on our sites.  Some email offers may include Web Beacons in order to help us record the rate of response, measure offer effectiveness, and enhance the relevancy of our email offers.  Web Beacons do not collect personal identifiable information that has been entered on Leisure.com websites.</p>
    <p>Be aware that opportunities to submit personally identifiable information about other people may present themselves.

      <li>Respond to requests</li>
      <li>Deliver products and services</li>
      <li>Notify users of updates, services, products, offers and promotions of interest</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information may be combined with publicly available information in order to customize your customer experience.  We wish to offer only relevant offers, and this method helps us do so.  We may also use this data to market to you through other advertising channels.</p>
    <p>Your information may be shared with vendors in order to provide you with relevant products and services.
