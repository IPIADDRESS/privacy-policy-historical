BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough Corporation respect the privacy of visitors to the LEVITRA Web site. This Web site endeavors to collect, maintain, and secure your personal information in accordance with the principles described within this policy. This policy applies only to the information collected on this Web site. This privacy policy does not apply to information collected offline.

<b>Data We Collect</b>

</p><p>
<b>How We Use and Disclose Your Information</b>

BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough and/or the companies we hire will use this information to comply with your request for information, to contact you in connection with the promotion of LEVITRA, to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services, or as otherwise disclosed to you on the Web page when you submit your information to us.

Some BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough websites use a third-party advertising service to display advertising on other, non-BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough Web sites. In addition to placing advertisements on certain non-BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough Web pages, these services may also place a segment of code called a clear pixel tag, also known as a "GIF", on certain BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough Web pages for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of advertisements in bringing visitors to our Web sites. GIFs may also be used with cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Web site, the number of visitors to various Web pages, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers.

As is common among Internet site operators, BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough Web sites maintain web server logs.

No personally identifiable information is contained in these web server logs.
</p><p>
<b>Confidentiality</b>

	<strong>Important Safety and Dosing Information</strong>  
	<p>LEVITRA is a prescription medicine that is used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). Men taking nitrate drugs, often used to control chest pain (also known as angina), should not take LEVITRA.  Such combinations could cause blood pressure to drop to an unsafe level.</p> 
	<p>As with all ED drugs, there is a rare risk of an erection lasting longer than four hours. To avoid long-term injury, seek immediate medical attention. LEVITRA does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. In rare instances, men taking PDE5 inhibitors (oral erectile dysfunction medicine, including LEVITRA) reported a sudden decrease or loss of vision in one or both eyes, or a sudden loss or decrease in hearing, sometimes with ringing in the ears and dizziness. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to these medicines or to other factors. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including LEVITRA, and call a doctor right away.</p>
	<p>Discuss your medical conditions, including heart problems, and medications, including alpha blockers prescribed for prostate problems or high blood pressure, with your doctor to ensure LEVITRA is right for you and that you are healthy enough for sexual activity. LEVITRA is not recommended for men with uncontrolled high blood pressure.</p> 
	<p>The starting dose of LEVITRA is 10 mg taken no more than once per day. Your doctor will decide the dose that is right for you. In patients taking alpha blockers, your doctor may start you on a lower dose of LEVITRA. In patients taking certain medications such as ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, atazanavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin and clarithromycin, lower doses of LEVITRA are recommended, and time between doses of LEVITRA may need to be extended.</p> 
	<p>In clinical trials, the most commonly reported side effects were headache, flushing, and stuffy or runny nose. LEVITRA is available in 2.5-mg, 5-mg, 10-mg, and 20-mg tablets.</p>
