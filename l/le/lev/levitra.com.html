This Web site endeavors to collect,  maintain, and secure your personal information in accordance with the  principles described within this policy. This policy applies only to the  information collected on this Web site. This privacy policy does not apply to  information collected offline. Information collected online from other Web  sites operated by BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough are governed by the privacy  statements that appear on those sites. </p>
            <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
            <p>BAYER, GSK, and  Schering-Plough will only collect personally identifiable information, such as  your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address, that you provide to us. Portions of this Web site may not  ask you to supply your personal information, allowing you to visit our site  without telling us who you are. However, some areas or services may require you  to provide personal information in order to receive promotional offers. When  you register with us, you may need to complete certain fields (some are  required and some are optional). In this instance, if you choose to withhold  any personally identifiable information required by us, it will not be possible  for you to obtain the promotional offers. </p>
            <p>In addition, BAYER, GSK, or  Schering-Plough may collect non-personally identifiable information about how  you use our Web sites using analysis technologies.

From time to time, this site may allow visitors to the site to send  "e-card" communications or messages that refer friends to the site.

            <h2>Cookies and  Internet Tags</h2>
            <p> Like many Web sites, this  Web site uses a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a small text  file that a Web server gives your browser to store on your computer when you  access a Web site. Cookies are capable of storing many types of data and may be  placed on your browser by BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough or by a third party.  Cookies may be used for a variety of purposes on this Web site: </p>
            <p>—This site sets cookies  that keep you from having to enter a password more than once during visits to  one or more of our sites. <br>
              —We also use cookies to  help us analyze usage of our sites and traffic among our sites more accurately  and to provide you with information of interest to you. For example, cookies  are used on this site to record the total number of hits received on the site  and Web pages. <br>
              —Cookies also allow BAYER,  GSK, and Schering-Plough to determine whether you came to this site from  another BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough site or from an advertising banner or  link on a non-BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough Web site, so that we can, for  example, measure the effectiveness of the links among our sites and the  effectiveness of our advertising on non-BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough Web  sites. <br>
              —Cookies also allow us to  maintain information about how particular visitors use our family of sites,  which enables us to better provide such visitors with information relevant to  their interests. This may include using information about your use of our sites  in conjunction with personally identifiable information that you have  volunteered to us on one of our sites. </p>
            <p> This is not an exhaustive  list of all uses of cookies on this Web site. In all cases in which cookies are  used, however, neither BAYER, GSK, Schering-Plough, nor any third party will  use the cookie to collect personally identifiable information from our site  unless you voluntarily agree to enter the information. Most web browsers are  set up to accept cookies. You can, however, reset your browser to refuse all  cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Note, however, that some  portions of our sites may not work properly if you refuse cookies. </p>
            <p> Some BAYER, GSK, or  Schering-Plough websites use a third-party advertising service to display  advertising on other, non-BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough Web sites. In addition  to placing advertisements on certain non-BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough Web  pages, these services may also place a segment of code called a clear pixel  tag, also known as a "GIF", on certain BAYER, GSK, and  Schering-Plough Web pages for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of  advertisements in bringing visitors to our Web sites. GIFs may also be used  with cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Web site, the number  of visitors to various Web pages, and the domain names of our visitors'  Internet service providers. No personally identifiable information is collected  in this process. </p>
            <p> As is common among Internet  site operators, BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough Web sites maintain web server  logs. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address and  collect that information in its web server logs. BAYER, GSK, and  Schering-Plough web server logs collect statistical data that is generated by  your computer when it visits a BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough Web site, such  as the type of web browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) and operating  system (Windows 95 or Mac OS) used to access the site, the domain name of your  Internet service provider, the date and time you access our site, and the pages  you visit. BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough Web sites use this non-personally  identifying web server log information for a variety of purposes. Some of these  purposes include: system administration; to examine overall traffic trends on  our sites; trouble-shooting; and to gather broad demographic information about  users of our sites. No personally identifiable information is contained in  these web server logs. </p>
            <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>You should keep in mind  that no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free. You should  therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via  e-mail. Moreover, where you use passwords, ID numbers, or other special access  features on this site, it is your responsibility to safeguard them. </p>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>BAYER, GSK, and  Schering-Plough use reasonable and appropriate technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect Personal Information (including e-mail address) from loss, misuse, or alteration.  We use encrypted data collection and transmission methods to collect sensitive Personal Information such as credit card or account information, if required for use of a service on a Web site. Our security procedures are reviewed on a regular basis. </p>

              As a convenience to our  visitors, BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough's sites currently contain links to a  number of Web sites that we believe may offer useful information. The privacy  policy and provisions described here do not apply to those sites. We suggest  contacting those sites directly for information on their data collection and  distribution policies. </p>

		  <p><strong>Important Safety and Dosing Information</strong></p>
		  <p>LEVITRA (vardenafil HCI) is a prescription  medicine that is used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). Men taking nitrate  drugs, often used to control chest pain (also known as angina), should not take  LEVITRA. Such combinations could cause blood pressure to drop to an unsafe  level.</p>
		  <p> As with all ED drugs, there  is a rare risk of an erection lasting longer than four hours. To avoid  long-term injury, seek immediate medical attention. LEVITRA does not protect  against sexually transmitted diseases. In rare instances, men taking PDE5  inhibitors (oral erectile dysfunction medicine, including LEVITRA) reported a  sudden decrease or loss of vision in one or both eyes, or a sudden decrease or loss in hearing, sometimes with ringing in the ears and dizziness. It is  not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to these  medicines or to other factors. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop  taking PDE5 inhibitors, including LEVITRA, and call a doctor right away.</p>
		  <p> Discuss your medical  conditions, including heart problems, and medications, including alpha blockers  prescribed for prostate problems or high blood pressure, with your doctor to  ensure LEVITRA is right for you and that you are healthy enough for sexual  activity. LEVITRA is not recommended for men with uncontrolled high blood  pressure.</p>
		  <p> The starting dose of  LEVITRA is 10 mg taken no more than once per day. Your doctor will decide the  dose that is right for you. In patients taking alpha blockers, your doctor may  start you on a lower dose of LEVITRA. In patients taking certain medications  such as ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, atazanavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole,  erythromycin and clarithromycin, lower doses of LEVITRA are recommended, and  time between doses of LEVITRA may need to be extended.</p>
		  <p>In clinical trials, the  most commonly reported side effects were headache, flushing, and stuffy or  runny nose. LEVITRA is available in 2.5-mg, 5-mg, 10-mg, and 20-mg tablets.</p>
		  <p>You  are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the  FDA.<br>
		Visit <a href="http://www.fda.gov/medwatch" target="_blank">www.fda.gov/medwatch</a>,  or call 1-800-FDA-1088.</p>
		  <p>Please see complete <a href="http://www.univgraph.com/bayer/inserts/levitra.pdf" target="_blank">Prescribing  Information</a>, which includes the patient information, for 2.5-mg, 5-mg, 10-mg, and 20-mg <br>LEVITRA<sup>®</sup> (vardenafil  HCl).<br>
