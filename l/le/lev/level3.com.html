<p>We may occasionally match or combine your personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information you have provided to other affiliate companies within our group in order to understand and improve the services we provide to you and to determine what other products, services or promotions may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>Where we process personally identifiable information in the course of our conferencing, audio or on-line services, this is done to allow us to provide the services which your company has asked us to provide, for example, by allowing us to create an authorized user ID for you, to allow you to use our services and by allowing us to provide billing and service usage information to your company.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Who do we share your information with?</h3>
<p>We do not sell or disseminate personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent. </p>
<p>Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we only share your personally identifiable information with our affiliated group companies and to our selected business partners who act on our behalf in order to provide the services. We make every reasonable effort to ensure that such our affiliates and business partners, including those in the U.S. and/or any other countries in which we operate, process your personally identifiable information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may share non-personal, non-individual information in aggregate form with other companies within our group or to carefully selected third parties. Your personally identifiable information may also be accessible by third-party service providers to whom we subcontract, including those who assist us in the provision of our services or who host and maintain our websites or our other services, or who provide billing and other out-sourced services to us. All such service providers must commit to complying with out instructions and to keep all personally identifiable information secure.&nbsp; Notwithstanding other provisions of this Privacy Policy, we may disclose personally identifiable information and account information in special cases when it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating any user agreement or may be causing injury to or interference with us, you, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. &nbsp;We may also disclose personally identifiable information as necessary to collect for the charges related to the services we provide.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as explicitly set forth in this Privacy Policy or any user agreement agreed to by you, or as otherwise required by government or law enforcement officials. We can, and you hereby authorize us to, disclose any information to law enforcement or other parties that we in our sole discretion, believe is required or appropriate to comply with the law.</p>
<p>We may disclose, assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party, your name, address, e-mail address, member name and any other personally identifiable information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of our assets or stock.</p>
<hr>
<h3>How long do we keep your information?</h3>
<p>The length of time we keep your information for can vary according to how we use that information. Unless there is a specific legal requirement to keep your information, we will not keep it for longer than we believe is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Direct Marketing</h3>
<p>We would like to keep you up to date with details of our products and services using the information that you have supplied. We will do this in accordance with applicable privacy laws and in accordance with any direct marketing permissions which were given when we collected information from you. If you would like to change these preferences, please contact the <a href="mailto:privacy@level3.com">privacy@level3.com</a> or speak to your Account Manager.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Transfers of your Information Outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)</h3>
We are a multinational group of companies and the information that we collect from you may be shared with Level 3 affiliate companies in locations around the world. All Level 3 entities comply with this Privacy Policy when they use personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
Users from the EEA should note that we may transfer personally identifiable information to countries outside of the EEA where we, or our subcontractors, may store and process it.&nbsp; Some countries to which personally identifiable information may be transferred may not have data protection legislation equivalent to EEA legislation, however, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that all personally identifiable information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>How to Review and Update your Information</h3>
<p>You may request a copy of the personally identifiable information we hold about you, such as contact information, banking details and marketing preferences, and you may review, correct, update, change or delete this information at any time by submitting a request to the <a href="mailto:privacy@level3.com">privacy@level3.com</a><em>. </em>Please note that in certain circumstances we may withhold access to your information where we have the right to do so under current data protection legislation. </p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie, also known as a browser cookie, is a text file containing small amounts of information which a server may download to your computer, mobile or tablet when you visit a website or use an app. </p>
<p>There are different types of cookies which are used to do different things, such as letting you navigate between different pages on a website efficiently, remembering preferences you have given and helping us to identify ways to improve your overall site experience.&nbsp; Others are used to provide you with advertising which is more tailored to your interests or to measure the number of site visits and the most popular pages users visit.</p>
<p>Due to their core role of enhancing and enabling usability or site processes, disabling certain cookies may prevent you from using certain aspects of our website. </p>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top">1.&nbsp;</td>
            <td><strong>Session cookies</strong> – these types of cookies are stored in the computer’s memory during a user’s browsing session and are automatically deleted from the user’s computer when the browser is closed or the session is deemed to have ended.&nbsp; These cookies usually store a session ID that is not personally identifiable to users, allowing the user to move from page to page without having to log-in repeatedly.&nbsp; They are widely used by commercial websites; for example, to keep track of items that a user has added to a shopping basket. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top">2.&nbsp;</td>
            <td><strong>Persistent cookies </strong>– these types of cookies are stored on a user’s computer and are not deleted when the browser is closed.&nbsp; Persistent cookies can be used to retain user preferences for a particular website, allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions.&nbsp; Persistent cookies usually assign a unique ID to the user’s browser and they are usually configured to identify a user for a prolonged period of time. </td>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Strictly necessary cookies</em><br>

If you prevent them, we cannot guarantee how our website will perform during your visit.</p>
<p><em>Performance cookies</em><br>
We use these cookies to collect information about how visitors use our website, which parts of the website you like and what types of content you view. By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device. We use the information to improve our website and enhance our user experience. &nbsp;All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. </p>

</blockquote><hr>
<h3>How can you control the use of cookies?</h3>
<p>Your use of this website constitutes your consent to this website setting cookies on your device.</p>
<p>If you do not want this website to set cookies on your device then you should not use this site and you should delete any cookies which have been placed on your device.&nbsp; Alternatively, the ‘Help’ menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookies and how to disable cookies altogether.&nbsp; However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our website’s essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Useful information about cookies can be found at:&nbsp; http://www.allaboutcookies.org</p>
<hr>
<h3>Linked Internet Websites</h3>
<p>Our websites may provide hyper-text links to other websites over which we have no control and which may contain privacy provisions that are difference from those provided herein. We are not responsible for and expressly disclaim any and all liability for the privacy policies or practices of other websites to which you choose to link from our websites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other websites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We have implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. Our websites have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. However, the internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. Certain information may be transmitted to you by electronic mail. Although it may be illegal to intercept or disclose these messages, these transmissions are not secured.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)</h3>
<p>CPNI is information that we obtain when we provide telecommunications services to you, including services provided through your local telephone company. It includes the types of telecommunications services you purchase from us, how you use them, and the related billing information for those services. CPNI does not include your telephone number, name and address. CPNI also typically includes the type of information found on your bill, such as call details and the types of local, long distance and other telecommunications services that you have purchased. We have internal policies and safeguards designed to safeguard the privacy of CPNI and protect it from unauthorized access or improper use. In the normal course of providing telecommunications services, we collect and maintain CPNI to enable us to make more meaningful suggestions to you when discussing products and services, packages and promotions that best suit your communications needs. In the US, we are obliged to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI in accordance with federal and certain state laws. We do not sell, trade or share your CPNI, including your calling records with anyone outside of our group of companies or to third parties who perform functions on our behalf (such as billing functions) except as may be required by law or authorized by you. Generally, we are also permitted to use or disclose CPNI to offer telecommunications services of the same type that you already purchase from us. We may also use or disclose your CPNI for legal or regulatory reasons such as a court order, to investigate fraud or to protect against the unlawful use of our telecommunications network and services and to protect other users of our services and to collect bills.</p>
