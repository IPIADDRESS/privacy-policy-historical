AT LEVENGER, WE STRIVE TO TREAT OUR CUSTOMERS AS WE DO OUR BEST FRIENDS. 
SO IN DEVELOPING THIS PRIVACY POLICY, WE APPLIED THE GOLDEN RULE TEST: IF WE WERE THE CUSTOMER, 
HOW WOULD WE WANT THE COMPANY TO TREAT US? OUR GOAL IS TO RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY EVEN AS WE GO ABOUT 
THE BUSINESS OF BRINGING YOU WELL-DESIGNED AND USEFUL PRODUCTS FOR YOUR READING, WRITING AND THINKING. 
</div>

<div class="Heading2">Information Collection and Use</div>

<div class="Main">
Levenger is the sole owner of the information collected on www.levenger.com. Levenger collects information from our users at several different points 
on our Web site.
</div>

<div class="Heading3">
Registration:<br>
(Request a catalog/Join our e-list/E-contest/Create an Account and Add Your Review)<br>
</div>

<div class="Main">
If you request a catalog, join our e-list or sign up for our e-contest a user is required to give 
their contact information (such as name, address and email address). We use this information to send 
the customer a catalog and/or marketing emails. It is optional for the user to provide unique 
identifiers (such as, username and password), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized 
experience on our site. We rent our customer’s mailing address with other third party catalog 
companies. If you wish to remove your name from third party rentals, it can be done by emailing our 
Customer Support at <a class="Links" href="https://www.levenger.com/customer/service/email/ContactEmailOrd.asp?Email=Cservice@levenger.com&amp;Typ=2">cservice@levenger.com</a>. 
Or, contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. 
If you submit a comment for Add Your Review, we collect your name, email, and city/state to use 
as part of the testimonial for the product. We do not use your email address for marketing purposes 
but we may use it to contact you directly regarding your feedback. As stated on the Add Your Review 
page, by submitting your information and comments, you authorize us to print your name and comments 
as a review for the product listed.
</div>

<div class="Heading3">Order</div>

<div class="Main">
We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact 
information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card 
number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes, to fill customer’s orders 
and to send the customer a catalog. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is also 
used to contact the user. We rent our customer’s mailing address with other approved third party 
direct marketing companies. If you wish to remove your name from third party rentals, it can be done by 
emailing our Customer Support at <a class="Links" href="https://www.levenger.com/customer/service/email/ContactEmailOrd.asp?Email=Cservice@levenger.com&amp;Typ=2">cservice@levenger.com</a>. 
Or, contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. 
</div>

<div class="Heading3">Cookies</div>

<div class="Main">
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about 
the user.  We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  For the session ID cookie, once users 
close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.  A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the 
user’s hard drive for an extended period of time.  We use persistent cookies with our service providers, 
Tealeaf, Coremetrics, and Dotomi.  This allows us to track our customer’s visit on Levenger.com and help 
improve our web site’s functionality, navigation and performance. Once you close your browser, we do not 
use cookies to store any of your personal or financial information on your computer.
</div>

<div class="Main">
We recognize that you have a choice to refuse cookies. If you choose not to accept the Levenger cookie, 
you may still use our site for browsing but purchasing is not possible.  By choosing to accept the 
Levenger cookie, we will save items in your shopping bag for 5 days and you will not have to log in 
more than once during each visit (user must close browser to end visit), thereby saving time while on 
our site. 
</div>

<div class="Main">
If you are shopping Levenger and are having difficulty adding product to your shopping cart or completing 
your order, please check your privacy settings in your browser.  Your privacy setting should be set at 
“Medium” to shop at Levenger.  If you prefer not to change your privacy settings, you can always place 
your order by phone at 800-677-8034. 
</div>

<div class="Heading3">Third Party Cookies</div>

<div class="Main">
Levenger has engaged Coremetrics, a third party service provider, to track and analyze non-personally 
identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to the website to help us administer 
our web site in order to constantly improve the web site quality. We do track and analyze personally 
identifiable usage for customers who have completed a purchase, requested a catalog or signed up for 
our e-list. Coremetrics uses cookies to help track visitor behavior and Levenger sets cookies that 
will be listed under the domain lev.levenger.com. Coremetrics does not use cookies to relate website 
visitors to any personally identifiable information and provides Levenger with information about site 
usage that reflects individual behavior of visitors, but not their identity. All data collected by 
Coremetrics on behalf of Levenger is used only to provide us with information on site usage and is not 
shared with any other third parties. If you would like to deactivate our ability to analyze your 
anonymous browsing and purchase behavior through the use of this service or find out more about our 
service provider, including its privacy policy and how to opt out, go to: <a class="Links" href="javascript:openWindow('/Customer/Service/opt_out.asp')">Opt-out</a>
</div>

<div class="Main">
Levenger has an advertising contract with Dotomi to serve display ads on our behalf across the Internet. 
Dotomi will collect anonymous information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with 
our products and services. They may use information about your visits to this website to target 
advertisements for goods and services. These targeted advertisements may appear on our site or on 
other sites that you visit. The anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, 
which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable 
information is collected or used in this process. If you do not want Dotomi to collect this 
information you may opt out. Opting out will not in any way, affect your use of our site. In order 
to opt out please <a class="Links" href="javascript:openWindow('http://usucmweb.dotomi.com/2082/optout.html')">click here</a>.
</div> 

<div class="Heading3">Log Files</div>

<div class="Main">
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, 
browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, 
and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, 
and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are tied to personally 
identifiable information to enable our Web-based service. We use a tracking utility called Deepmetrix 
and Tealeaf that use log files to analyze user movement.
</div>

<div class="Heading3">Clear Gifs</div>

<div class="Main">
We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs). Clear gifs are 
tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are are used throughout 
our site to track sales and statistical information from visitors to the web site. The main difference 
between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size 
of a period at the end of a sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users’ personally identifiable 
information.</div>

<div class="Main">
In addition, we use clear gifts in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been 
opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications 
and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails 
or change the type of email they receive to text, please see the Opt-out section.
</div>

<div class="Heading2">Communications from the Site</div>

<div class="Heading3">
Special Offers and Updates</div>

<div class="Main">
Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, 
and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive 
these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.
</div>

<div class="Heading3">Service Announcements</div>

<div class="Main">
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, 
if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, 
users may not opt-out of these communications. However, these communications are not promotional 
in nature. 
</div>
<div class="Heading3">Customer Service</div>

<div class="Main">
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to 
issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes. 
</div>

<div class="Heading2">Sharing</div>

<div class="Main"><span class="Callout">These are the instances in which we will share users’ personal information:</span></div>         

<div class="Heading3">Legal Disclaimer</div>

<div class="Main">
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal 
information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is 
necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served 
on our Web site.
</div>

<div class="Heading3">Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</div>

<div class="Main">
We share aggregated demographic information with our partners. This is not linked to any personally 
identifiable information.

<div class="Heading2">Third Party Intermediaries</div>

<div class="Main">
We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, an outside telemarketing company to take 
orders and a credit card processing company to validate charges for goods. These companies do 
not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
</div>

<div class="Heading3">Service Providers</div>

<div class="Main">We partner with other third parties such as Experian and e-Dialog to provide specific 
services. For example, e-Dialog is our email vendor that transmits all of our marketing 
emails and Experian is responsible for the data processing and postal sortation for each 
catalog mailing. When the user signs up for these particular services, we share names, email 
addresses and mailing address information that is necessary for the third party to provide 
these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information 
except for the purpose of providing these services.</div>

<div class="Heading3">Business Transitions</div>

<div class="Main">
In the event Levenger Company goes through a business transition, such as a merger, 
being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users’ personal 
information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified 
via email or direct mail prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. 
If as a result of the business transition, the users’ personally identifiable information will 
be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given 
choice consistent with our notification of changes section.
</div>

<div class="Heading3">Choice/Opt-out</div>

<div class="Main">
Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes 
not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our 
order form has an ‘opt-out’ mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don’t want any 
marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.
</div>

<div class="Main">
Users who no longer wish to receive our promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these 
communications by replying to unsubscribe or remove in the subject line in the email or email us 
at <a class="Links" href="https://www.levenger.com/customer/service/email/ContactEmailOrd.asp?Email=Cservice@levenger.com&amp;Typ=2">cservice@levenger.com</a>. 
We also offer an opt-out mechanism on the ACCOUNT INFO PAGES or the user may contact us at 
800-544-0880 or at 420 S. Congress Avenue, Delray Beach, FL 33445 to opt-out.
</div>

<div class="Main">
Users of our site will not be notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties.
</div>

<div class="Heading3">Links</div>

<div class="Main">
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Levenger Company, are not 
responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when 
they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects 
personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by 
this Web site.
</div>

<div class="Heading3">Contests</div>

<div class="Main">
Our site requests information from users via the e-contests. Participation in this contest is 
completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. 
The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), 
and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to notify the winners 
and award prizes. Users’ personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless 
we give prior notice and choice.
</div>

<div class="Heading3">Email-A-Friend</div>

<div class="Main">
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them 
for the friend’s name and email address. Levenger will automatically send the friend a one-time 
email inviting them to visit the site. Levenger does not store this information. We use the 
information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.
</div>

<div class="Heading3">Security</div>

<div class="Main">
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit 
sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.
</div>

<div class="Main">When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit 
card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in 
the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom 
of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed 
to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’. To learn more about SSL, follow this <a class="Links" href="http://www.levenger.com/customer/service/security.asp">link</a>.
</div>
 
<div class="Main">
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our 
power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive 
information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information 
to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are 
granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date 
on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified 
and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users’ 
information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are 
in a secure environment, in a locked facility.
</div>

<div class="Main">
If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to 
<a class="Links" href="https://www.levenger.com/customer/service/email/ContactEmailOrd.asp?Email=Cservice@levenger.com&amp;Typ=2">cservice@levenger.com</a>.
</div>

<div class="Heading3">Supplementation of Information</div>

<div class="Main">
In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us 
to supplement the information we receive with information for third-party sources. 
</div>

<div class="Heading3">ID (Address) Verification</div>

<div class="Main">
We use a third-party software to verify a user’s mailing address.
</div>

<div class="Heading3">Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</div>

<div class="Main">
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or 
postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or 
deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the Account 
Info page or by emailing our Customer Support at <a class="Links" href="https://www.levenger.com/customer/service/email/ContactEmailOrd.asp?Email=Cservice@levenger.com&amp;Typ=2">
cservice@levenger.com</a>.Or, contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information 
listed below. 
</div>

<div class="Heading3">Notification of Changes</div>

<div class="Main">
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, 
and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, 
how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in 
accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
</div>

<div class="Main">If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different 
from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice 
as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted 
out of all communication with the site, or deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, 
nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material 
changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, 
we will not post a notice on our Web site or notify users of the change via email or direct mail.
