<li>when legal rights are affected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How We Use Your Data with Third Party SmartsCards</strong>.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>As described above, you can opt-in to opting-in to one or more Lemon SmartCards, which are add-ons developed by third parties using the Lemonade platform, in which case we may share your data with such third parties.&nbsp; Please note that if you do not want this data shared, you should not opt-in to those SmartCard add-ons or if you have already opted-in, you would need to uninstall the SmartCard.&nbsp; These third parties may request additional information directly from you.&nbsp; If you provide any data directly to these third parties, please note that we are not responsible for the security of any data you provide directly to these third parties, which would be governed by those parties’ policies.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Your Data with Third Party Partners</strong>.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>As part of providing you with our service, we have written agreements with third parties pursuant to which we are able to offer you additional functionality as part of the Lemon service.

</ul>
<p>This section will be updated from time to time to reflect the parties with whom we have these relationships.&nbsp; Please note that we may make changes, replace or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) these services at any time for any reason with or without notice.</p>
<p><strong>How We Protect Your Data</strong>.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>The security of your data is a top priority for us.&nbsp; We use reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the personal information that we obtain from you from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. &nbsp;These are a few of the ways we are safeguarding your information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>SSL and Password Encryption</em></strong>.&nbsp; You log in to the dashboard on our website using SSL (secure sockets layer), the standard in Internet security for authentication and encryption.&nbsp; This encrypts data transmitted between your device and our servers, including passwords.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>PIN-Entry Required for Payment Card Data</em></strong>.&nbsp; We grant you access to the payment card data you store using our mobile apps only upon your entry of the PIN number that you select.&nbsp; That PIN number is not know to us or stored anywhere in our system.&nbsp; We use your PIN as part of our data encryption process.&nbsp; Be sure to select your PIN carefully–because we don’t store your PIN, if you lose or forget it, you will not be able to retrieve your PIN (although you do offer a process for you to reset your PIN).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Discrete, Authenticated Sessions</em></strong>.&nbsp; Once you have logged in to your Lemon account (on your mobile phone or in the dashboard on our website), you can end that session by logging out.&nbsp; After you have ended your session, your data cannot be accessed on your mobile phone or the dashboard on our website without your re-entering your password (and PIN, if applicable).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Restricted Access</em></strong>.&nbsp; We protect centralized databases and storage systems by preventing access from the public internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that we are not responsible for the security of any data you are transmitting over the internet, or any data you are storing, posting or providing directly to a third party’s website, which is governed by that party’s policies. Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. If you have further questions about security, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:su%70%70%6f%72%74@l%65monhq%2ec%6fm%2e">support@lemonhq.com.</a></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;How You Can Update or Delete Your Data</strong>.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>You can update or delete receipt and payment card data and images stored in Lemon by using the edit feature in our mobile app or the dashboard on our website.&nbsp; If you wish to close your Lemon account altogether, you can do so in the dashboard on our website.&nbsp; If there is other information that you have provided to us other than through our mobile app that you wish to change or delete, please let us know by submitting a request to <a href="mailto:%73%75%70po%72%74@lemo%6ehq.co%6d.">support@lemonhq.com.</a>&nbsp; Note that we may retain your personal information in our databases for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, in accordance with our applicable data retention policies and applicable laws. Our retention and use of your information will be as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. &nbsp;The retention period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later. &nbsp;For example, we may need or be required to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity, protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain, or if we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.&nbsp; Your personal information will be stored in secured locations and on servers controlled by us. &nbsp;In all cases, we reserve the right to use data obtained previously to verify your identity or take other actions that we believe are appropriate. We will respond to your request for access within 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your Data When Legal Rights are Affected</strong>.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>We may be required to share your information where legal rights are affected.&nbsp; These are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will share your data if this is required by law or to respond to requests from law enforcement officials and regulatory agencies and in connection with certain court proceedings.</li>
<li>We may share your data where this is in the interest of protecting or exercising our or others’ legal rights, for example, in connection with court proceedings, or to detect or prevent criminal activity, fraud, material misrepresentation, or to establish our rights or defend against legal claims.</li>
<li>We may sell your data in connection with selling, merging, transferring or reorganizing all or parts of our business.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Email Communications.&nbsp; </strong><strong>If you opted-in to receive information about our product, updates and offers,</strong> we will use your name and email address to send this information to you. If you no longer wish to receive these newsletters, you can unsubscribe by following the instructions contained in the emails you receive or in the dashboard on our website.&nbsp; Please note that we may send you service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so, even if&nbsp; you have unsubscribed from our marketing communications.&nbsp; For instance, if our service is going to be temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email to update you.&nbsp; Because you may not opt-out of these communications, if you do not wish to receive them, you would need to stop using our services and mobile apps and delete your account.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information of Third Parties</strong>.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>If you choose to purchase a Pro or Business Plan and if you want to share data with family members or co-workers, you can provide us with their email address.&nbsp; We will then send them an email inviting them to create a Lemon account.&nbsp; Lemon stores&nbsp; this information for the purpose of sending this invitation email.&nbsp; If your family member or co-worker does not wish to have this information stored, they can contact us at <a href="mailto:supp%6fr%74@lemo%6ehq.%63%6fm">support@lemonhq.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<p><strong>Public Parts of Our Website</strong>.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>There are parts of our website, such as the comments sections in our blog, that are public.&nbsp; If you disclose personal data in any public forum on our website, that data becomes public and can be accessed and used by people other than us.&nbsp; We aren’t responsible for their use of your personal data.&nbsp; If you are worried about this, don’t post personal data in public places on our website. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:s%75pp%6frt%40lemohq.com.">support@lemohq.com.</a>&nbsp; We will let you know if we are unable to remove your personal information and the reason why.</p>

If you submit personal information to any of those websites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.</p>
