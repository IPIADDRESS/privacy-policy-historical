<h5>Security Standards</h5>
<p>
The security of your Personal Information is important to us and we have put into place multi-layered technical, physical and procedural measures to help keep it safe. For example we keep Personal Information encrypted during transit and at rest using strong encryption technology and employ proactive monitoring and other tools to protect against unauthorized access. We work with third parties on an ongoing basis to keep our practices current and compliant with laws and industry standards relating to data security and privacy. We protect the credit card data you submit to us for payment of the Services in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.
</p>
<p>
Despite our mutual efforts, you understand and agree that perfect security does not exist and understand that there is a certain amount of risk inherent in providing and receiving services over the internet. The Services depend upon your commitment to keep your Personal Information safe. You agree to use your Personal Information in a reasonable way and to avoid recklessly disclosing your Social Security number, financial account numbers or other Personal Information to those that could improperly use or disclose it. For example, take care not to visit sites that may transmit malware, or to respond to “phishing” scams, unsolicited emails, or pop-up messages requesting your Personal Information. You may have the opportunity to participate in contests, blogs, promotions or other functions by way of the Site. Use caution when deciding to disclose your information in such a submission as these functions may be provided by a Third Party Website and subject to terms which are different than those stated in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information or the security of the Site, you can send us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@lifelock.com">Privacy@LifeLock.com</a>
</p>

<h5>Social Media</h5>
<p>
Our Site may include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the "Share this" button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly and for other purposes. Social Media Features and Widgets are displayed on our Site, but are hosted by the third party identified in the widget. These Social Media Features and Widgets are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one, and their privacy practices may differ from those on this Site.
</p>

<h5>Testimonials</h5>
<p>We display personal testimonials of customers on our site in addition to other endorsements.  With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name.  If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@lifelock.com">Privacy@LifeLock.com</a>
</p>

<h5>Children's Privacy</h5>
<p>We believe it is important to provide added protection for children on the internet and encourage parents and guardians to work with their children to understand how to be safe online. Our Site is not intended for the use by anyone under the age of eighteen (18) except where minors are receiving Services from us through registration by their parent or legal guardian. Other than as specifically described herein, we do not want or intend ever to collect or request Personal Information from anyone under the age of eighteen.
</p>

<h5>Marketing</h5>
<p>
If you provide us with your email address or mailing address, you may receive marketing messages and materials from us or our affiliates. You have choices on what communications you want to receive from us. If you choose not to receive marketing communications, we will honor your request. However, we will continue to communicate with you as needed to provide the Services, respond to your inquiries or otherwise relay service related messages.
</p>
<p>
You can stop receiving promotional email or postal communications from us by following the instructions included in each communication, <a href="/subscribe/">by changing your preferences</a>, or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe.nonmember@lifelock.com">unsubscribe.nonmember@lifelock.com</a> or by regular mail at Attn.: Marketing, 60 East Rio Salado Parkway, Suite 400, Tempe, AZ.
</p>

<h5>Tracking and Behavioral or Interest-based Advertising</h5>
<p>
Currently, we do not honor browser requests not to be tracked online. You may opt-out, however, of being tracked for purposes of online advertising as discussed in this section.
</p>
<p>
We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. For example, we use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our websites and other websites you may visit. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to advertise more effectively by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use some of the technologies described in this policy, such as cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), and Flash Local Storage Objects (Flash LSOs) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. This helps us, and them, provide advertising content to you that is more relevant and tailored to your interests. As with links to other websites that may be found on our Site, these Tracking Technologies are governed by each third party's privacy policy, not this one.
</p>
<p>We may provide these third-party advertisers with non-personally identifiable information about your usage of our Site and our Services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our Services. We do not provide these third parties with your Personal Information. If you don't want us to show you interest-based ads or share interest-based behavioral data with third parties, you can opt out (see below). Understand that even after opting out you will still see online ads. Opting out only means that network members from whose ad networks you have opted out will no longer deliver targeted content to you. You may continue to see interest-based advertisements from other parties from whom you have not opted out, or from companies that have not adopted the self-regulatory standards for Online Behavioral Advertising that we follow. You will also continue to receive generic ads that aren’t targeted based on your visits to multiple websites.
</p>
<p>
You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"). For more information and available choices for third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>
    (NAI) and <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> (DAA).
</p>
<p>
As noted, we also participate in third party ad networks and use cookies to improve the performance of our advertising on third-party websites, including to display ads about LifeLock products on these sites. You may control our use of the General Information we collect about your activities on our Site to display targeted LifeLock advertising during your visits to third party websites. To opt out of receiving these targeted LifeLock ads, click <a href="/advertising-choices/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note: If your browser is configured to reject cookies when you visit the opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on TRUSTe’s, NAI's and DAA's websites accessible by the above links.

<p><strong>Web Beacons / Gifs.</strong> We employ (either directly or through one of our third party advertising partners) a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our Site by educating us on what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
