<h3>How We Use Your Data</h3>
<p>We use your data to provide you our services.&nbsp; We may share your information with third parties, but it will only be in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>we’ve told you in advance, for example, if we’ve disclosed it in our Privacy Policy;</li>

<li>we’ve aggregated it and removed any information that may identify you; or</li>
<li>when legal rights are affected.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How We Use Your Data with Third Party Apps</h3>
<p>As described above, you can authorize Lemon to share your stored payment credentials to complete transactions with third-party developers and merchants who have developed apps that utilize Lemon’s check-out services, , in which case we may share your data with such third parties.&nbsp; Please note that if you do not want this data shared with these apps at the time of a transaction, you would simply not consent to sharing the information.&nbsp; These third parties may request additional information directly from you.&nbsp; If you provide any data directly to these third parties, please note that we are not responsible for the security of any data you provide directly to these third parties, which would be governed by those parties’ policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How We Use Your Data with Third Party Partners</h3>
<p>As part of providing you with our service, we have written agreements with third parties pursuant to which we are able to offer you additional functionality as part of the Lemon service. Because the additional services provided by these parties form part of the Lemon service, you may not opt-out of receiving them. If you do not wish to receive these additional services, you would need to stop using the Lemon service and our mobile apps and delete your account. In this section, we describe those parties and how your data is used in providing the Lemon service.&nbsp; Our written agreement with these parties require that they protect the confidentiality and security of your data, and to use your data only on our behalf and only in the way we permit in the written agreement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Womply:&nbsp; The Lemon service incorporates the services of Womply, which allows you to receive rewards from participating Womply merchants.&nbsp; These rewards are automatically applied to your credit or debit card.&nbsp; When you add a credit or debit card to your Lemon account, Womply will automatically check to see if you’ve transacted at a Womply merchant.&nbsp; If you have transacted at a Womply merchant and you earn a reward, Womply will notify Lemon, and we will let you know when you have earned a reward.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section will be updated from time to time to reflect the parties with whom we have these relationships.&nbsp; Please note that we may make changes, replace or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) these services at any time for any reason with or without notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How We Protect Your Data</h3>
<p>The security of your data is a top priority for us.&nbsp; We use reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the personal information that we obtain from you from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. &nbsp;These are a few of the ways we are safeguarding your information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>SSL and Password Encryption</em></strong>.&nbsp; You log in to the dashboard on our website using SSL (secure sockets layer), the standard in Internet security for authentication and encryption.&nbsp; This encrypts data transmitted between your device and our servers, including passwords.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>PIN-Entry Required for Payment Card Data</em></strong>.&nbsp; We grant you access to the payment card data you store using our mobile apps only upon your entry of the PIN number that you select.&nbsp; That PIN number is not know to us or stored anywhere in our system.&nbsp; We use your PIN as part of our data encryption process.&nbsp; Be sure to select your PIN carefully–because we don’t store your PIN, if you lose or forget it, you will not be able to retrieve your PIN (although we do offer a process for you to reset your PIN).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Discrete, Authenticated Sessions</em></strong>.&nbsp; Once you have logged in to your Lemon account (on your mobile phone or in the dashboard on our website), you can end that session by logging out.&nbsp; After you have ended your session, your data cannot be accessed on your mobile phone or the dashboard on our website without your re-entering your password (and PIN, if applicable).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Restricted Access</em></strong>.&nbsp; We protect centralized databases and storage systems by preventing access from the public internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that we are not responsible for the security of any data you are transmitting over the internet, or any data you are storing, posting or providing directly to a third party’s website, which is governed by that party’s policies. Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. If you have further questions about security, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:%73up%70%6frt@lem%6fn%68%71%2e%63%6fm.">support@lemonhq.com.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>&nbsp;How You Can Update or Delete Your Data</h3>
<p>You can update or delete data and images stored in Lemon by using the edit feature in our mobile app or the dashboard on our website.&nbsp; If you wish to close your Lemon account altogether, you can do so in the dashboard on our website.&nbsp; If there is other information that you have provided to us other than through our mobile app that you wish to change or delete, please let us know by submitting a request to <a href="mailto:suppo%72t%40%6ce%6d%6fn%68q%2ecom.">support@lemonhq.com.</a>&nbsp; Note that we may retain your personal information in our databases for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, in accordance with our applicable data retention policies and applicable laws. Our retention and use of your information will be as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. &nbsp;The retention period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later. &nbsp;For example, we may need or be required to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity, protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain, or if we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.&nbsp; Your personal information will be stored in secured locations and on servers controlled by us. &nbsp;In all cases, we reserve the right to use data obtained previously to verify your identity or take other actions that we believe are appropriate. We will respond to your request for access within 30 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sharing Your Data When Legal Rights are Affected</h3>
<p>We may be required to share your information where legal rights are affected.&nbsp; These are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will share your data if this is required by law or to respond to requests from law enforcement officials and regulatory agencies and in connection with certain court proceedings.</li>
<li>We may share your data where this is in the interest of protecting or exercising our or others’ legal rights, for example, in connection with court proceedings, or to detect or prevent criminal activity, fraud, material misrepresentation, or to establish our rights or defend against legal claims.</li>
<li>We may sell your data in connection with selling, merging, transferring or reorganizing all or parts of our business.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</li>
