    <p>
    	<strong>Disclosure in accordance with section 2804(b) of the Insurance Law</strong>
    </p>
    <h3>If you are a first time user please read the following disclosure:</h3>
    <p>
        In connection with this insurance, we may review your credit report or obtain or use a credit-based insurance score, based on information
        contained in that report. We will not review your credit report or obtain or use a credit-based insurance score in states where this is
        prohibited. An insurance score uses information from your credit report to help predict how often you are likely to file claims and how
        expensive those claims will be. Typical items from a credit report that could affect a score include, but are not limited to, the
        following: payment history, number of revolving accounts, number of new accounts, the presence of collection accounts, bankruptcies and
        foreclosures. The information used to develop the insurance score comes from TransUnion.
    </p>

    <h3>If you used our services before and you wish to renew your policy please read the following:</h3>
        

    <p>
        In connection with this insurance, we may have previously used a credit report or obtained or used a credit-based insurance score based on
        information contained in that report. We may obtain or use credit information provided again, however, upon renewal of policy, such
        information may only be used to reduce premiums. We will not review your credit report or obtain or use a credit-based insurance score in
        states where this is prohibited. An insurance score uses information from your credit report to help predict how often you are likely to
        file claims and how expensive those claims will be. Typical items from a credit report that could affect a score include, but are not
        limited to, the following: payment history, number of revolving accounts, number of new accounts, the presence of collection accounts,
        bankruptcies and foreclosures. The information used to develop the insurance score comes from TransUnion.

<h3>Location information and other information from devices:</h3>
<p>
    When you use the services through the App on a device, we will collect and use information about you in generally similar ways and for similar purposes as
    when you use the Lemonade website. In addition, we may collect information about your location. We may use the location information collected from your
    device to enhance your use of the Lemonade services by providing you with relevant content and contextual advertising. You can change the privacy settings
    of your device at any time, in order to turn off the functionality to share location information through the App and/or the website. Please note that
    turning off location sharing may affect certain features of our services. Though we may identify your geographic location, we do not receive your personal
    information. We identify your location only to provide a more tailored experience for you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<h3>Does Lemonade share my information with others?</h3>
<p>
    We will not share or sell your information for marketing purposes. We will share certain personal information with our partners and providers in order run
    our service and to resolve an incident. For example, we may share your name, address, and phone number with a plumber in order to deal with a burst pipe.
    We may also share non-personally identifiable information in order to improve our modeling and perform aggregate reporting,

<h3>How do you protect my information?</h3>
<p>
    We restrict access to your information to our employees and others who we feel must use it to provide our products and services. We also maintain
    electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>If I designate a cause for Giveback, what does that cause learn about me?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    First off, thanks for giving to a cause! You will have an opportunity to share whatever information about yourself that you wish. If you have given
    permission to a cause to give third parties information about you, such as your name, address or email, then we may be a recipient of that information.
</p>
<h3>What information about me is shared with members of my cause?</h3>
<p>
    We believe that insurance is all about <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/blog/time-to-giveback/">supporting causes</a>. In some causes, such a local community organization, the internal rules of the organization may
    permit its members to learn the identity of other members. You can choose to share additional information about your claims and <a href="/giveback">Giveback</a> to the other
    members if you wish to. However, we will never share your personal information or claims information in an identifiable manner with the cause you have
    selected. That decision is yours to make.
</p>
<h3>How does Lemonade communicate with its policyholders?</h3>
<p>
    We primarily message our policyholders through email and the Lemonade App. Certain email communication related to your account and claims must be delivered
    and do not include an unsubscribe option. Please ensure that the email we have on record is accurate. You can manage app notifications through your device
    settings.
</p>
<h3>Who should use Lemonadeâ€™s website and App?</h3>
<p>
    Our products and services are intended for anyone 18 years of age and old; we do not market any products or services to children under the age of thirteen
    or knowingly collect any information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that information is or has been submitted by or collected
    from a child under the age of thirteen, we will delete this information.
</p>
<h3>Will Lemonade ever change this Privacy Policy?</h3>
<p>
    As Lemonade evolves, we may need to update this policy. No matter what we change, we will always maintain our commitment to protecting your privacy. We
    will post all revisions, along with their effective dates. We recommend that you check this page every so often to make sure youâ€™re familiar with the
    latest policy. We will ask for your consent to policy changes if required by applicable law; in other cases, please note that your continued use of the
    Service after any change means that you agree with, and consent to be bound by, the new Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>General, Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>
    We reserve the right to discontinue or modify any aspect of the Services at any time. This Policy, together with our Terms of Service and any other legal
    notices published by us on our website and in the App, shall constitute the entire agreement between us concerning the Services. If any provision of this
    Policy is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions
    of this Policy, which shall remain in full force and effect, provided, however, that in such event this Policy shall be interpreted so as to give effect,
    to the greatest extent consistent with, and permitted by, applicable law, to the meaning and intention of the excluded provision as determined by such
    court of competent jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
    This Policy shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. We each agree to submit to the
    personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the State where the policy was issued, and waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum
    objections to such courts.
