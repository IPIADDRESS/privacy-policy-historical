                        receiving communications concerning Learning.com, updates to its

                        The term "opt out" refers to the user's ability to provide an electronic

                        not limited to promotional and general informational email. This is done

                        with such selection made by the user at the user's sole discretion. The

                        regarding communications from Learning.com by updating the User's 
                        information on Learning.com's "My Settings" link. The "opt in" and "opt

                        written to your computer. They make our Website easier for you to use 
                        because they save your preferences while you're at our sites (although 
                        we do not save passwords in cookies). Cookies also help us know which 
                        areas are your favorites, which may need improvement and what 
                        technologies and Internet services our Users like. Knowing this

                        we track with cookies is anonymous and is not used to identify, or lead 
                        us back to, any particular User. Users may have the option of disabling 
                        cookies via their browser preferences (most browsers are initially set 
                        up to accept cookies). However, some features of our Website will not

                        An IP address is a number that has been automatically assigned to your

                        system administration, to report aggregate information to our 
                        advertisers, sponsors, and partners, and to audit the use of our site. 
                        When Users request Web pages from our services, our servers log the

                        compliance with our rules or terms of service or to protect our service,
