A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by lead411. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location data:</span></p>

Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use the information we collect or receive, such as your email address, to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions, and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related emails. You may also be able to be “found” on lead411 based on information that you provide (see “Find friends on lead411”) above.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instances where we are required to share your information:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead411 will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use or to protect the security, quality or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of lead411, our Users, or others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage and Processing:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which lead411 or its subsidiaries, affiliates, or service providers maintain facilities. lead411 may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which lead411 or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping your information safe:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event you are provided with an opportunity to establish and account or profile on our site, you may be able to access your Personally Identifiable Information with your password and username. This password is encrypted. We advise against sharing your password with anyone.&nbsp; If you access your account via a third-party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-in protections via that third-party site or service. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-in mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer, browser, or mobile device by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. If we believe that the security of your information may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are committed to taking all reasonable precautions to safeguard the privacy of personal information which has been provided by its users. We use technical, contractual, administrative and physical security steps to protect your personal information. Security measures such as restricted access and the use of passwords and encryption have been adopted to protect your personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. Our employees have been trained to respect your privacy at all times and those employees with access to your personal information shall use your personal information strictly in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet or via e-mail is completely secure and therefore we cannot guarantee protection of all personal information in all cases. For example, we cannot guarantee protection against interception, misappropriation, misuse, or alteration, or that your information will not be disclosed or accessed by the unauthorized acts of others. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compromise of information:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, lead411 will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We make every effort to promptly process all unsubscribe requests. As noted above, you may not opt out of Service-related communications (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). If you have any questions about reviewing or modifying your account information, you can contact us directly at support@lead411.io.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opting out of collection of your information for Tracking / Advertising:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please refer to your mobile device or browser’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools. Depending on your type of device, it may not be possible to delete or disable tracking mechanisms on your mobile device. Note that disabling cookies and/or other tracking tools prevents lead411 or its business partners from tracking your browser’s activities in relation to the Service, and for use in targeted advertising activities by third parties. However, doing so may disable many of the features available through the Service. If you have any questions about opting out of the collection of cookies and other tracking/recording tools, you can contact us directly at support@lead411.io.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long we keep your private profile information:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following termination of your User account, lead411 may retain your private profile information for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, any information that you choose to make public on the service may not be removable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information for Users in Europe and Elsewhere Outside the U.S.:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use our site or services outside of the United States, you agree that we may collect, process, and store your personal information in the United States and other countries. The laws in the U.S. regarding personal information may be different from the laws of your country. Any such transfers will comply with safeguards as required by relevant law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes to this Policy:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead411 reserves the right to modify this privacy policy from time to time, so please review it regularly.
