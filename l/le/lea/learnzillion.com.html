<h4>Effective November 5, 2015</h4>
<p class="pvs">
We know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy (and the privacy of students) seriously. We’ve updated our privacy policy and
<a href="/terms">terms of use</a>
to be more accurate with our practices and clearer to read.
<a href="/contact">Let us know</a>
if you have any questions.

<p class="pvs">
LearnZillion, Inc. ("LearnZillion") is committed to protecting the privacy of students, parents, and educators, while providing students and schools with a dynamic learning and teaching environment made possible by the Internet. This privacy policy addresses the online privacy practices of LearnZillion. LearnZillion's products and services are intended for ultimate use by parents, teachers and students, but only school districts, teachers, or parents may sign up for LearnZillion. This policy is applicable to all LearnZillion products and services available online (the “Site”).
</p>
<h3 id="consent">Consent by School Districts, Teachers and Parents</h3>
<p class="pvs">
LearnZillion is not offered directly to students on any basis, and school districts, teachers, or parents must first sign up for primary accounts, and then invite students to use LearnZillion through student accounts. If LearnZillion learns that a student of any age has created a primary account, that account will be deleted. School districts, teachers and parents consent to LearnZillion collecting and using the student data described in this Privacy Policy by creating or providing enrollment codes for students to create student accounts. This policy applies to students of all ages, including those under the age of 13.
</p>
<h3 id="primary_holders_control_data">Primary Account Holders Control Data</h3>
<p class="pvs">
When school districts or teachers create primary accounts and invite students to create student accounts, they are acting on behalf of parents to give LearnZillion permission to collect the information described in this Privacy Policy, and LearnZillion is acting as a service provider to the school district or teacher. For these types of primary account, all requests to review, delete or edit student information must come from the school district or teacher, and parents should make use of the school’s policies with respect to reviewing, deleting or editing such information. When parents are the primary account holders, they may delete or edit student information through the LearnZillion user interface or by contacting LearnZillion at
<a href="/contact">https://learnzillion.com/contact</a>
. Primary account holders can also review, delete or edit information associated with their account.
</p>
<p class="pvs">
Note that even follow such deletion requests, we may store secure backups until they are deleted in accordance with our document retention policy. We may also preserve information as part of an investigation into violations the law or our terms of use.
</p>
<h3 id="student_acct_creation">How Are Student Accounts Created?</h3>
<p class="pvs">
When the primary account belongs to a school district, student accounts will be populated in coordination with that district. Students will then be provided login information in a manner specific to that district and in accordance with district policy, which may in some cases be through a district-wide “single sign-on” or by communicating an initial login and password to the student.
</p>
<p class="pvs">
When the primary account belongs to a teacher or a parent, students are added using a name, nickname or pseudonym by the teacher or parent. LearnZillion then generates enrollment codes that students can use to register student accounts.
</p>
<h3 id="info_students_teachers">What Information Does LearnZillion Collect About Students and Teachers?</h3>
<p class="pvs">
We maintain records for each student account of assignments that have been given (and results that have been submitted) and records of any online assessments taken by the students.
</p>
<p class="pvs">
When the primary account belongs to a teacher or a parent, we collect the student name information provided by the teacher or a parent, and then collect a username and password when the student registers. Student records are linked to teacher or parent records, which may include the teacher’s or parent’s name, email address, grade levels taught, self-reported school and school district information, and geographic information about the district such as its zip code. We also collect information about teacher’s title, subject interests and teaching experience.
</p>
<p class="pvs">
When the primary account belongs to a school district, initial information about students, teachers and schools is provided from the district’s records, and may include unique identifiers that link these records to other records in the district’s database system as well as teachers’ names and titles and the name of the teacher’s school. Districts also may provide information about a student’s grade level, the student’s username, password and email address, a statewide student identifier and information about the school that the student attends.
</p>
<p class="pvs">
In every case we also log certain detailed technical information about all users’ interactions with our Site that could be linked with users (including students). This includes the IP addresses that we get when users connect to our Site, information that is sent by web browsers automatically when they connect to our Site (such as the type of web browser, the operating system used and the time zone set on the user’s computer), the timing and frequency of how users interact with different content and different areas of our Site.
</p>
<h3 id="how_we_collect_information">How We Collect Information</h3>
<p class="pvs">
We set cookies so that we are able to recognize when someone is connecting to our Site who is currently logged in or who has visited before. A cookie is a data file sent to a browser from a web server and stored on the user’s computer's hard drive that allows us to recognize that browser when the user returns to our Site. To learn more about browser cookies, including how to manage or delete them, look in the Tools, Help or similar section of your browser, or visit
<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</a>
</p>
<p class="pvs">
Additionally, our video player may store local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, on users’ computers. Local shared objects cannot be managed in the same way as browser cookies. For information on managing Flash cookies, visit

</p>
<p class="pvs">
We (or our email service providers) may place a tiny image, also known as a pixel tag, in the emails we send, to tell us when you have opened the email. Our team uses this information to improve emails we send to you, and best tailor them to the needs of school districts, teachers and students.
</p>
<p class="pvs">
Like most online services, when you use the Site, we automatically collect and store details of how you used our service, such as your activity on the Site, and the frequency and duration of your visits.
</p>
<p class="pvs">
By using our Site you agree to our use of these information collection technologies.
</p>
<p class="pvs">
We do not track our users across third party websites, nor do we use targeted advertising. As a result, we do not currently honor “do not track” signals transmitted by users' web browsers.
</p>
<h3 id="student_info_others_see">What Student Information Can Other Users See?</h3>
<p class="pvs">
When the primary account belongs to a school district, the account administrator designated by the district can access all information we collect about students that we make available through our web-based user interface. District administrators can delegate the right to view student information in accordance with district policy. Each teacher within that school district can see only information relating to students’ participation in classes taught by that teacher (unless granted additional access by the district account administrator).
</p>
<p class="pvs">
Primary account holders who register as teachers or parents can access all information available through our user interface relating to students’ interactions with assignments created by that teacher or parent. They cannot see information that we collect in connection with a student’s interactions with assignments created by another teacher or parent.
</p>
<h3 id="other_personal_info_use">What Else Does LearnZillion Do With Personal Information?</h3>
<p class="pvs">
We will not share personal information we collect in any way not described by this Privacy Policy. Except as noted below, we do not share any personal information with third parties for advertising, marketing or other purposes. There is no third-party advertising on LearnZillion.
</p>
<p class="pvs">
We use all data we collect to improve the design, content and performance of our Site and to analyze site usage and the popularity of our Web pages.
</p>
<p class="pvs">
We may from time to time use parent and teacher email addresses for marketing purposes relating to the Site, e.g., sending emails about new features.
</p>
<p class="pvs">
We use third-party service providers to provide a variety of services, such as assisting us with providing customer support, hosting the Site, providing us with analytics about how people use our Site, assisting us with marketing the Site to school districts and teachers, sending and tracking responses to email, providing a framework for the delivery of assessment questions and helping us identify and track bugs and errors in the Site. All of our service providers have agreed to confidentiality and data security provisions consistent with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p class="pvs">
When a school district is the primary account holder, we share information with third parties at the direction of the school district, and it is the school district’s responsibility to make such requests in a manner that is consistent with their internal policies and the law. We also will provide information:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="pvs">where required by law or in response to legal process (for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena)</li>
<li class="pvs">if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or</li>
<li class="pvs">to investigate and act upon violations of our terms of use.</li>
</ul>
<p class="pvs">
Student and teacher information may be included in the sale of LearnZillion’s assets or a merger of LearnZillion with another company. The personal information we have collected will continue to be covered by the then-applicable Privacy Policy. If there are changes to this Privacy Policy in the future, school districts, teachers and parents may agree to those changes or choose to stop using LearnZillion and we will delete their information and the information about their students. We will not agree to include the personal information we collect in a sale to a buyer who does not agree to comply with pre-existing commitments concerning such information.
</p>
<h3 id="third_parties">Third Party Web Sites</h3>
<p class="pvs">
Our site includes some links to other sites. We are not responsible for the data collection practices on those other sites. We advise you to carefully review those sites' privacy policies before submitting personal information there.
</p>
<h3 id="security_practices">Security Practices</h3>
<p class="pvs">
We strive to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of the personal information we collect from children and adults. We have put in place physical, electronic and administrative procedures to safeguard and to help prevent unauthorized access to and maintain the security of personally identifiable information collected through this site.
</p>
<p class="pvs">
Primary accounts and student accounts are protected by passwords. Please keep these passwords secret to prevent unauthorized access to these accounts. If you think someone has gained unauthorized access to an account, please contact us immediately.
</p>
<p class="pvs">
We take reasonable, industry-standard measures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information collected on our Site. This includes the use of encryption, firewalls and other security technologies to prevent access to the data from unauthorized parties. All connections between users and our Site are secured via encryption communication technology (SSL/TLS). All passwords are salted and hashed using the practices recommended by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). We use highly rated application hosting providers who agree to perform frequent diagnostics, operating system updates, and network security monitoring. Our engineering team is committed to creating and maintaining systems to protect personal information.
</p>
<p class="pvs">
Only employees who need to access user information in order to perform their job (for example, customer service) are granted access to student information.
</p>
<p class="pvs">
While we have taken all steps to protect the personal information we collect, and we work to keep our systems in line with industry standards, no system is 100% fail proof and secure. If we believe that the security of your personal information have been compromised, we will seek to notify you as soon as possible, and you consent to our use of email as a means of such notification.
</p>
<h3 id="notice_of_changes">Notice of Changes to This Policy</h3>
<p class="pvs">
If we make changes to this Policy, we will post the changes here with a new effective date at the top. If we intend to use or disclose members' personal information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you by email.
</p>
