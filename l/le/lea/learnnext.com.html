	<p><b>What Information Do we Collect?</b></p>
	<p>When you visit our Web site you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web site usage information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site.</p>
	<div class="abhead">Personal Information You Choose to Provide</div>
			<div class="twoCols">
                <h5>Registration Information.</h5>
                <p>You will provide us information about yourself that will enable us to verify whether you are entitled to access and use certain information, materials and services available from the Web site <a href="http://www.learnnext.com">LearnNext</a> This information may also be used to enable us to enhance your Site visit, to assist you with customer service or technical support issues, or to follow up with you after your visit, or to otherwise support your relationship with <a href="http://www.nexteducation.in">Next Education</a> It is completely optional for you to participate. However, failure to participate may mean that you cannot access and use certain information, materials and services.<br>
For example, we request information from you when you:</p>
				
                    <ul class="privSt">
                        <li>Log-on to certain areas of the Web site <a href="http://www.learnnext.com">LearnNext</a> where you may be prompted to provide us with your Log in Name and Password as a condition to gaining access to certain information, materials or services.</li>
                        <li>Register or sign-up to use a service.</li>
                        <li>Subscribe to a newsletter or desire to be added to our mailing lists for other products and services.</li>
                        <li>Place an order.</li>
                        <li>Provide feedback in an online survey.</li>
                    </ul>
             
	            <p>In each of the instances above, we typically ask for your name, e-mail address, phone number, address, Log in Name and Password, as well as, other similar personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers. On occasion, we may ask for additional information to enable us to provide you with access to and use of certain information, materials and services. In the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailers at any time.</p>
	            <p>Wherever <a href="http://www.nexteducation.in">Next Education</a> collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.</p>
				<h5>How we use information</h5>
	            <p><a href="http://www.nexteducation.in">Next Education</a> uses your personal information for specific purposes only. The personal information you provide to us when using the Web site, such as your name, postal, e-mail address or telephone number will be kept confidential and used to support your relationship with <a href="http://www.nexteducation.in">Next Education</a> to notify you of special offers, updated information and new products and services from <a href="http://www.nexteducation.in">Next Education</a>, or offers from third parties that we think may be of interest to you. Agents or contractors of <a href="http://www.nexteducation.in">Next Education</a> who are given access to your personal information will be required to keep the information confidential and not use it  for any other purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for  <a href="http://www.nexteducation.in">LearnNext.</a></p>
				<h5>Sharing information with Third Parties</h5>
                <p><a href="http://www.nexteducation.in">Next Education</a> may enhance or merge your information collected at its Web site with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you.
With respect to network advertising companies (companies that manage and provide advertising for numerous unrelated companies), to the extent that <a href="http://www.nexteducation.in">Next Education</a> utilizes such advertising companies to provide advertisements on the Web site, may provide them with your Sign in Name and any demographic information about you that we collect. Those advertising companies may combine that data with non-personally identifiable data collected by the advertising company from your computer, solely for the purpose of delivering on our Web site, advertisements that are targeted to you.</p>
				<p>Circumstances may arise where we are required to disclose your personal information to third parties for purposes other than to support your customer relationship with <a href="http://www.nexteducation.in">Next Education</a>, such as in connection with a corporate divestiture or dissolution where we sell all or a portion of our business or assets (including our associated customer lists containing your personal information), or if disclosure is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings.</p>
               <p>We will send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you.
