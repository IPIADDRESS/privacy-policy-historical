<h3 id="information-collection-and-use">Information Collection and Use</h3>

<p>Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the products and services made available through the Site, including, but not limited, to the Service, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one. In general, Leanpub collects Personal Data when you register with Leanpub, when you use Leanpub services and when you visit Leanpub pages or pages related to the Content posted on Leanpub pages. That information is used to fulfill your requests for products and services, to conduct research, to contact you, to contact those who purchase your Content and to improve Leanpub services.</p>

<h3 id="information-collected-upon-registration">Information Collected Upon Registration</h3>

<p>If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Ruboss. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Service, or if you desire to receive marketing materials and information. Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your IP address, full user name, password, email address, city, time zone, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in your public profile.</p>

<h3 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h3>

<p>Your full user name and your photo, if you decide to upload one, are displayed to people on the Leanpub site to enable you to connect with people on Leanpub, as specified in your privacy settings. Once a member, you may provide additional information in the profile section, including but not limited to your bio, your location, as well as your personal web site, if you have one. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find new friends and opportunities in the Leanpub system. If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you.</p>

<h3 id="use-of-contact-information">Use of Contact Information</h3>

<p>In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about, our products and services, including but not limited to our Service. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.</p>

<h3 id="log-data">Log Data</h3>

<p>When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For many users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and of our Service, and for the Site’s technical administration. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of Service.</p>

<h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>

<p>Like many websites, we also use “cookie” technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site and our service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. Leanpub may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and our Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our services. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p>

<h3 id="information-sharing-and-disclosure">Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

<h4 id="service-providers">Service Providers</h4>

<p>We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.</p>

<h4 id="compliance-with-laws-and-law-enforcement">Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h4>

<p>Ruboss cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law.
