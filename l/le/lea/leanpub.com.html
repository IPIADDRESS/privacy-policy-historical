<p>Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the products and services made available through the Site, including, but not limited, to the Service, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one.

<h3 id="information-collected-upon-registration">Information Collected Upon Registration</h3>

<p>If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Ruboss. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Service, or if you desire to receive marketing materials and information.

Once a member, you may provide additional information in the profile section, including but not limited to your bio, your location, as well as your personal web site, if you have one.

This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For many users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on.
