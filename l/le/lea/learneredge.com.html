            <br>
            <b>Information Collection</b><br>
            SpryMediaOnline is the sole owner of the information collected on the Site. SpryMediaOnline
            collects information from its users at several different points on our Site.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Registration</b><br>
            In order to use SpryMediaOnline services which are a pre-pay service, a user must
            first complete the registration process. During registration a user is required
            to give contact information (such as name, email address, telephone number, home
            address, etc), a unique identifier, and financial information (such as credit card
            information, billing address, etc.). We use this information to contact the user
            about services on our Site for which the user has expressed interest and to provide
            those services and bill user for the services.

            <b>Profile</b><br>
            We store information that we collect through cookies, log files and third parties
            to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on
            individual users that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected
            information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information to provide
            offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to
            tailor a user's visit to our Site, and to potentially direct pertinent marketing
            promotions to them. We do not share personally identifiable elements of your profile
            with other third parties. Your profile is shared in aggregate form only.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Cookies</b><br>
            A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about
            the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information
            while on our site. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For
            the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.
            A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an
            extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet
            browser help file directions.
            <br>
            By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more
            than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they
            may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user might be limited
            in some areas of our site. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the
            interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. See the "Profile"
            section, above.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Log Files</b><br>
            Like most Web sites, our servers use log files to analyze trends, administer the
            site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information
            for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable
            information.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Clear Gifs</b><br>
            Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies,
            and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between
            the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about
            the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users'
            personally identifiable information.<br>
            We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails
            have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of
            certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users
            would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section.<br>
            <br>
            <b><span class="medium">Communications from the Site</span></b><br>
            <br>
            <b>Special Offers and Updates</b><br>
            We send all new registered users a welcoming email to verify a new user’s contact
            information and PIN or password. Existing registered users will occasionally receive
            emails containing information about us, service related announcements, information
            about third party services that are likely to be of interest to our members, and
            member satisfaction questions.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Service Announcements</b><br>
            On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement.
            For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send
            users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though
            they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional
            in nature.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Customer Service</b><br>
            We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and regarding
            issues relating to their accounts. We reply via email or phone, in accordance with
            the users wishes.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Sharing</b><br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketing Partners<br>
            We may from time to time share your personal information with third party marketing
            partners who may send you offers for goods and services which you may find of interest.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal Disclaimer<br>
            Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal
            information when required by law or where we have a good-faith belief that such
            action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding or administrative hearing,
            or other legal process served on our Site. For example, SpryMediaOnline may disclose
            personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or third parties
            in response to criminal or civil subpoenas. If we do receive a request to disclose
            a registered user’s personal information, we will notify user of such request
            at the email or telephone number recorded in our database at that time. Users are
            advised to keep current their contact information on file with us and update it
            accordingly.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aggregate Information
            (non-personally identifiable)<br>
            We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers.
            This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third Party Intermediaries<br>
            We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for services. These
            companies have contracted with us not to retain, share, store or use personally
            identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business Transitions<br>
            In the event SpryMediaOnline goes through a business transition, such as a merger,
            being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal
            information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will
            be notified prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information.
            If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information
            will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they
            will be given a choice not to have their information used in this different manner,
            as described in the notification of changes section, below.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Choice/Opt-out</b><br>
            If at any time you decide you no longer wish to receive communications from us or
            third parties you can unsubscribe here: <a href="unsubscribe.aspx">
                http://learneredge.com/unsubscribe.aspx</a>. Please note that third parties
            with whom we have already shared your information will not receive this request
            and you may unsubscribe from those sites using the mechanism in the emails they
            send.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Links</b><br>
            This Site may contain links to other web sites. Please be aware that SpryMediaOnline
            is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our
            users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of
            each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This
            Statement applies solely to information collected by this Site. SpryMediaOnline may
            enter into advertising and affiliate relationships with third party web sites which
            drive interested parties to our Site. Information that is collected on these third
            party sites are not controlled by this Policy, and users are advised to read the
            separate privacy policies of these web sites.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Surveys</b><br>
            Periodically, our Site might request information from users via surveys. Participation
            in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether
            or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes
            contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such
            as zip code). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving
            the use and satisfaction of SpryMediaOnline's services. Users' personally identifiable
            information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and a choice
            to opt-out. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys, they may
            not use customers' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Security</b><br>
            SpryMediaOnline takes precaution to protect its users' information. When users submit
            sensitive information via the SpryMediaOnline's Web Site, their information is protected
            both online and off-line.<br>
            When our registration/order forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such
            as credit card number, billing information, etc.), that information is encrypted
            and is protected using industry standard encryption software (128 bit secure socket
            layers protocols).
            <br>
            While we use SSL encryption protocols to protect sensitive information online, we
            also employ security measures to protect user-information off-line. All of our users'
            information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in
            our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for
            example, our billing clerks or a customer service representative) are granted access
            to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally
            identifiable information are in a secure environment.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Supplementation of Information</b>
            <br>
            In order for SpryMediaOnline to properly fulfill its obligations to users it is necessary
            for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party
            sources. SpryMediaOnline may verify the billing address on all credit card transactions
            and may obtain credit reports for some customers. The information obtained from
            these third party sources is maintained in a manner consistent with SpryMediaOnline's
            privacy Policy.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</b><br>
            If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone,
            email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide
            a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information.
            Users may login in to their account and then access the profile page to change any
            personal information, or they may contact us by email using the "Contact Us"
            page.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
            If we decide to change our Policy, we will post those changes in this Policy, and
            other places we deem appropriate, so our users are always aware of what information
            we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
            We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information
            was collected.
            <br>
            If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a
            manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users
            via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information
            in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication
            with the Site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted,
            nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if
            we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information
            already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Site notifying
            users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users,
            who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes
            in our privacy practices.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Contact Information</b><br>
