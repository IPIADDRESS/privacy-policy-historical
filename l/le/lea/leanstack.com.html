      <article dir="ltr"><p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Effective: May 25, 2018</b></p>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Introduction</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect at LEANSTACK, how LEANSTACK uses it, and what choices you have.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">When we talk about “LEANSTACK,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this policy, we are referring to LEANSTACK, Inc., the company which provides the Services. When we talk about the “Services” in this policy, we are referring to our online workplace productivity tools and platform. Our Services are currently available for use via a web browser or applications specific to your desktop or mobile device.</p>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Information we collect and receive</h4>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">1. Customer Data</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Content and information submitted by users to the Services is referred to in this policy as &nbsp;<b>“Customer Data.”</b> As further explained below, Customer Data is controlled by the organization or other third party that created the account (the <b>“Customer”</b>). Where LEANSTACK collects or processes Customer Data, it does so on behalf of the Customer. Here are some examples of Customer Data: lean canvases, experiment reports, and validation plans. A user may also choose to enter information into their profile, such as first and last name, job, a photo and a phone number.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">If you join an organization and create a user account, you are a “user,” as further described in the &nbsp;<a href="/leanstack-terms-and-policies/terms/user-terms-of-service">User Terms of Service</a>. If you are using the Services by invitation of a Customer, whether that Customer is your employer, another organization, or an individual, that Customer determines its own policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of Customer Data which may apply to your use of the Services. Please check with the Customer about the policies and settings it has in place.</p>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">2. Other information</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">LEANSTACK may also collect and receive the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account creation information. Users provide information such as an email address and password to create an account.</li>
<li>Organization setup information. When a Customer creates an account using the Services, we collect an email address, a company name, domain details (such as leanstack.com/organization-name), and password.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Billing and other information. For Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services, our corporate affiliates and our third party payment processors may collect and store billing address and credit card information on our behalf or we may do this ourselves.</li>
<li>Services usage information. This is information about how you are accessing and using the Services, which may include administrative and support communications with us and information about the teams, people, features, content, and links you interact with, and what third party integrations you use (if any).</li>
<li>Log data. When you use the Services our servers automatically record information, including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you are using it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you visited before using the Services, your browser type and settings, the date and time of your use of the Services, information about your browser configuration and plug-ins, language preferences, and cookie data.</li>
<li>Device information. We may collect information about the device you are using the Services on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings.</li>
<li>Geo-location information. Precise GPS location from mobile devices is collected only with your permission. WiFi and IP addresses received from your browser or device may be used to determine approximate location.</li>
<li>Services integrations. If, when using the Services, you integrate with a third party service, we will connect that service to ours. The third party provider of the integration may share certain information about your account with LEANSTACK. However, we do not receive or store your passwords for any of these third party services.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Third party data. LEANSTACK may also receive information from affiliates in our corporate group, our partners, or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This might be aggregate level information, such as which IP addresses go with which zip codes, or it might be more specific information, such as about how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Our Cookie Policy</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">LEANSTACK uses cookies and similar technologies like single-pixel gifs and web beacons, to record log data. We use both session-based and persistent cookies.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer and from your computer or mobile device to us each time you visit our website or use our desktop application. They are unique to your account or your browser. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Some cookies are associated with your account and personal information in order to remember that you are logged in and which teams you are logged into. Other cookies are not tied to your account but are unique and allow us to carry out site analytics and customization, among other similar things. If you access the Services through your browser, you can manage your cookie settings there but if you disable some or all cookies you may not be able to use the Services.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">LEANSTACK sets and accesses our own cookies on the domains operated by LEANSTACK. In addition, we use third parties like Google Analytics for website analytics. You may opt-out of third party cookies from Google Analytics on its website.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">What can you do if you don't want cookies to be set or want them to be removed, or if you want to opt out of interest-based targeting?</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Some people prefer not to allow cookies, which is why most browsers give you the ability to manage cookies to suit you. In some browsers you can set up rules to manage cookies on a site-by-site basis, giving you more fine-grained control over your privacy. What this means is that you can disallow cookies from all sites except those that you trust.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Browser manufacturers provide help pages relating to cookie management in their products. Please see below for more information.</p>

In addition, on your iPhone, iPad or Android, you can change your device settings to control whether you see online interest-based ads.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">If you limit the ability of websites and applications to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience and/or lose the ability to access the services, since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings, like login information.</p>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Does LEANSTACK respond to Do Not Track Signals?</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Our Sites and Services do not collect personal information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. Therefore, “do not track” signals transmitted from web browsers do not apply to our Sites or Services, and we do not alter any of our data collection and use practices upon receipt of such a signal.</p>
