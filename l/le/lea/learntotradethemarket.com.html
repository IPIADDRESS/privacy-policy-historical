				<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>This Policy applies to Learn to trade the Market Pty Ltd (ABN: 68&nbsp;137&nbsp;007&nbsp;062 ) and any holding companies, other subsidiaries or related entities of Learn To Trade The Market, all of which are referred to as ” LTTTM”, “we”, “our”, or “us”. The Policy extends to and covers all operations and functions of LTTTM.</p>
<p>At LTTTM, we are committed to ensuring the confidentiality and security of the personal information supplied by individuals. LTTTM is bound by the National Privacy Principles (‘NPPs’) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (‘Privacy Act’). LTTTM has appointed a Privacy Officer, who oversees the Privacy Policy, and ensures that LTTTM’s management of personal information is in accordance with this Policy and with the Privacy Act.</p>
<p>LTTTM ‘s Privacy Policy Statement will be reviewed from time to time to take account of new laws and technology, changes to our operations and practices and to make sure it remains appropriate to the changing environment.</p>
<p>The word “individual” refers to a customer, client, trustee or any other person with whom we come into contact. All contractors, sub-contractors, vendors, service providers, customers, agents or any other third parties that have access to and/or utilise personal information collected and/or held by LTTTM must abide by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>“Personal information” is information or an opinion relating to an individual, which can be used to identify that individual. Some personal information, which we collect, is “sensitive information”. “Sensitive information” includes information relating to a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, trade union or other professional or trade association membership, sexual preferences and criminal record, which is also personal information, and also includes health information about an individual.</p>
<p>1. How we collect personal information</p>
<p>As the provider of financial services, including stock market and options trading education, we may collect sensitive information about an individual’s personal circumstances and financial details such as their bank account details, and credit history, which may potentially identify the individual and/or contains an opinion about the individual.</p>
<p>Our ability to provide individuals with our products and services is sometimes dependent on us obtaining certain personal information about the individual. Typically, the type of personal information we collect about the individual includes his or her name, age, date of birth, occupation, mailing address, phone numbers, email address and other information that is relevant to the products and services we provide.</p>
<p>The personal information may also include information about the form of identification used in relation to an individual to send or receive a transaction (required by law in some instances), and information about a transaction in relation to an individual, including details of the amounts paid in or out of an individual’s account as well as delivery instructions.</p>
<p>We generally collect personal and/or sensitive information from individuals by the following methods:</p>
<p>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directly from applications, questionnaires and/or forms completed by individuals (via our websites), which include surveys or special offers, when individuals wish to use our services, purchase our products or apply for a position in our organisation;</p>
<p>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from information disclosed to us by an individual on the phone, or by sending us correspondence (by letter, fax or email) or contact us in person; and</p>
<p>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from a variety of third party sources, including our business contacts credit reference and credit checking agencies, and financial institutions.</p>
<p>The above list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may be provided with personal information about an individual from somebody else, for example a referral from another person. We will take reasonable steps to inform the individual that it holds the personal information and the purpose for which it holds the personal information.</p>
<p>We must not collect sensitive information unless the individual has consented, or it is required by law, or in other special specified circumstances.</p>
<p>If the personal information we request is not provided, we may not be able to provide individuals with the benefit of our services, or meet an individual’s needs appropriately.</p>

Safeguarding the privacy of your information is important to us, whether you interact with us personally, by phone, mail, over the internet or other electronic medium. We hold personal information in a combination of secure computer storage facilities and paperbased files and other records, and take steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.</p>

All employees must be provided with opportunities to attend appropriate and periodic Privacy awareness training and must ensure that they understand the Privacy related issues that could adversely affect LTTTM ’s position if not properly adhered to.</p>
