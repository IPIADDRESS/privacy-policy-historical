      <h1 class="h1 downsized">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Welcome to <a href="http://www.leadid.com/">www.leadid.com</a> (the "Site"), a  website owned and controlled by Lead Intelligence, Inc. ("Lead  Intel", "we", "us", or "our"). We operate  the Site and Lead Intel software products and services made available through  the Site (collectively the "Services"), as well as our platform (the  "LeadiD Platform"), all of which allow for creation of a unique lead  identifier ("LeadiD") to be created for each unique online or  software event (“Event” or “Events”), as well as capabilities to audit LeadiDs,  in real-time or in batch. We provide this privacy policy to let you know what  information we collect and how we use it, share it, and protect it.</p>
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>As a general rule, there are these categories of users of the  Site and Services, and some users may belong to more than one category:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span>"Publishers"  who are individuals or organizations who are accessing and using the LeadiD  Platform to create LeadiDs (collectively the "Publisher Sites"), and </span></li>
        <li><span>"LeadiD  Auditors" and "LeadiD Pre-Auditors" who are individuals or  organizations who are accessing and using the LeadiD Platform to query LeadiDs,  and related lead information, against a set of rules, flags and/or actions  (these rules, flags and/or actions are defined as a "LeadiD  Audit").&nbsp; The LeadiD Audit's rules,  flags and/or actions are predefined by the owner of the LeadiD Audit.&nbsp; LeadiD Audit owners may authorize other  parties to query their LeadiD Audits.&nbsp;  Parties who query their own LeadiD Audits are referred to as LeadiD  Auditors; Parties who query a LeadiD Audit that another party owns are referred  to as LeadiD Pre-Auditors.&nbsp; For the sake  of simplicity, we may use LeadiD Auditors to refer to any party who queries a  LeadiD Audit, regardless of whether or not the querying party owns that  particular LeadiD Audit. </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are also individuals who may visit the Site and/or who may  visit Publisher Sites and enter information into forms on those sites  ("End Users").</p>
      <p>        This Privacy Policy applies to data that may be volunteered by  End Users of Publisher Sites and also applies in some cases to Publishers and  LeadiD Auditors. By visiting the Site or utilizing the Services, you are  accepting the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Privacy Practices for Visitors to LeadiD.com Site </h2>
      <ol class=" last">
        <li><span>The  information we gather and how we use it: The Site is primarily directed to  Publishers, LeadiD Auditors and LeadiD Pre-Auditors, although we welcome End  Users who want to know more about our Services. When you access the Site, we  may collect information that may be used to identify or locate an individual,  like a person’s full name, postal address, e-mail address, phone number,  Facebook ID, Twitter ID, or billing information, as well as other non-public  information that is associated with this information (“Personally Identifiable  Information” or “PII”). We will not collect PII except when you knowingly  provide it, including when you register for the Site, provide feedback, or  request information. We use your PII to administer your account and provide you  services, to send communications and administrative emails, to respond to your  inquiries, and to send marketing and product update messages to those who ask  for such messages. Typically, Publishers and LeadiD Auditors, rather than End  Users, visit the Site in order to access and register for the Services. For  example, Publishers may provide their email address when they register on the  Site and create a user name and password.</span></li>
        <li><span>Controlling  our use of your PII: If you have provided PII such as your email address when  registering for our Site, you may modify that information at any time by  visiting your account settings (<a href="http://app.leadid.com/users/edit">http://app.leadid.com/users/edit</a>). While we  would be sorry to see you go, you can delete your account at any time. You can  opt out of receiving certain email communications from the Site by clicking the  "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of each email, or similar opt out  links may be provided.</span></li>
        <li><span>Information  Sharing: We share PII collected via the Site with other companies or  individuals as follows:
<ul>
        <li><span>With  third parties if we have a good faith belief that access, use, or disclosure of  such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy applicable law,  regulation, legal process, or an enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce  the applicable Terms of Use of the Services, including but not limited to  investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or  otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues, or (d) protect against  harm to the rights, property, or safety of Lead Intel, its users, or the public  as required or permitted by law. </span></li>
        <li><span>In  the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by  another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your PII may be  among the assets transferred. </span></li>
      <li><span>Within  the use of the LeadiD Audit service, some of the requested information may  include PII that is associated with the information within your account, such  as your company's name. </span></li></ul></span></li>
</ol>
      <h2> Privacy Practices for End Users Who Visit Publisher Sites that have Services Installed</h2>
      <p>We operate the Services, as well as the “LeadiD Platform”, all  of which allow for a unique LeadiD to be created for each unique online form  event, as well as capabilities to query LeadiDs, in real-time or in batch. When  you, an End User, enter information into a form on a Publisher Site, the  Services that have been installed on the Publisher Site automatically create  and return to the Publisher a LeadiD. We associate certain non-personally  identifiable information (“Non-PII”) automatically for use on the LeadiD  Platform. Certain LeadiD Services capture data that you, an End User, enter  into a form on a Publisher Site. In these cases, any personally identifiable  information (“PII”) that an End User volunteers is encrypted using a  Cryptographic hash function which makes it infeasible for anyone, including us,  to store, retrieve, reverse-engineer, or utilize the PII that was volunteered  by the End User. We enable LeadiD Auditors, as well as Publishers, to use this  Non-PII information via the LeadiD Platform for analytics purposes, as  described below.</p>
      <p> The information we gather and how we use it:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><span>PII:&nbsp; We will not store PII that is volunteered by  End Users on a Publisher’s Site. As described above, any PII that is entered by  an End User on a Publisher’s site who is utilizing LeadiD Services, will not be  stored as PII, and may only be stored as Non-PII in the form of encrypted  values.</span></li>
        <li><span>Non-PII:&nbsp; We collect Non-PII through the provision of  Services for use on the LeadiD Platform. For example, when you visit a  Publisher Site, our server logs may collect your Internet Protocol address,  browser type, browser language, and the date and time that that web page was  visited, as well as other Non-PII.</span></li>
        <li><span>Controlling  our use of your Non-PII: If you don't want us to store your Non-PII, you can  opt-out by not filling out online forms that utilize the Services.</span></li>
        <li><span>Information  Sharing: We share Non-PII with other companies or individuals as follows:
       <ul>
        <li><span>To  enable us to provide our Services to LeadiD Auditors who wish to certify that  an Event took place in which an End User legitimately participated, as well as  other associated information, including but not limited to when, where, and by  whom that Event took place. </span></li>
        <li><span>We  share any information we have with third parties if we have a good faith belief  that disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy  applicable law, regulation, legal process, or an enforceable governmental  request, (b) enforce the applicable Terms of Service, including investigation  of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address  fraud, security, or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the  rights, property, or safety of Lead Intel, its End Users, or the public as  required or permitted by law. </span></li>
        <li><span>In  the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by  another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, we expect that any  and all information that we have will be among the assets transferred. </span></li>
        <li><span>In addition, we may aggregate your Non-PII with the  Non-PII of others and share that aggregated information with third parties  without restriction. </span></li>
      </ul></span></li>
      </ol>
      <ol class="alpha last">
      </ol>
      <h2>Information Security and Retention</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable security measures to protect against  unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction  of data. These include firewalls and encryption, internal reviews of our data  collection, storage and processing practices, and security measures, as well as  physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems.</p>
      <p>        We restrict access to PII to Lead Intel employees, contractors,  and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or  improve our Services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality  obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, if they  fail to meet these obligations. However, we are unable to guarantee that the  security measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that your  information will remain secure under all circumstances.</p>
      <p>        We retain individual records of PII and Non-PII indefinitely,  with End User PII remaining in its encrypted format, as described herein.</p>
<h2>Children</h2>
      <p>We do not knowingly collect or maintain PII from individuals  who are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site or Services are designed  to attract people under the age of 13. Protecting the privacy of children is  very important to us. If we obtain knowledge that a user is under the age of  13, we will take steps to remove that user's PII from our databases.</p>
      <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
      <p>Our Site and Services provide services to third party websites  and services. The fact that we provide services to these entities is not an  endorsement, authorization, or representation that we are affiliated with that  third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security  policies or practices. This privacy policy applies only as provided in the  "Scope" section above. Other websites and services follow different  rules regarding the use or disclosure of personal information. We encourage you  to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit and  especially those where you provide your PII to them.</p>
      <h2>International Users</h2>
      <p>The Site and Services are hosted in the United States. If you  access the Site or Services from the European Union, Asia, or any other region  with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and  disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through  your continued use of the Site or Services, you are transferring your PII to  the United States and you consent to that transfer. Additionally, you  understand that your PII may be processed in countries (including the United  States) where laws regarding processing PII may be less stringent than in your  country.</p>
      <h2>Questions or Comments?</h2>
      <p>Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding  this Privacy Policy by contacting us through this Site, by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@leadid.com">support@leadid.com</a>,  or writing to us at:</p>
