    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This Leap Motion privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is intended to inform you of Leap Motion Inc.’s (“we,” “us,” or “our”) policies and practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information through the Leap Motion Site and Leap Motion Services. We define Personal Information as information that allows someone to identify or contact you, including for example your name, address, telephone number, and email address.</p>

<p>By registering with us or using our website, you expressly consent to the information handling practices in this privacy policy. If you reside outside the United States, you understand that your personal information may be processed in countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing personal information may be less stringent than in your country.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is a part of our Terms of Use. If any term of this Privacy Policy is inconsistent or conflicts with any term of the Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy will control. Capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Use.</p>

<h3>Personal Information You Provide to us</h3>

<p>When you register to use Leap Motion Services, we may collect your name, e-mail address and e-mail preferences, and password for your account. We may also ask you to provide additional information on an optional basis in connection with setting up your account. You may also register by using your log-in credentials from social networking websites, including Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. When you register in this way, we may collect Personal Information from the social networking websites that you have given us permission to collect or made publicly available. The information Leap Motion obtains may depend on your privacy settings with the social networking website. When you purchase any Materials or services from the Leap Motion Site, we may collect your name, phone number, e-mail address, mailing address, billing address, complete credit card information that enables us to receive your payment (however we do not retain your credit card number unless requested) and federal tax identification number or European Union VAT number as applicable. When you give us feedback, we may collect any information that is contained in your feedback. When you contact us by sending us an e-mail, fax, or letter, we collect your e-mail address, fax number, or mailing address, and any information contained in the e-mail, fax, or letter you send us.</p>

<h3>Personal Information Collected via Technology</h3>

<p>As you use the Leap Motion Site or any Leap Motion Service, some information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, access time, mobile phone model, and telecom carrier. We may also store a small text file called a “Cookie” on your computer or phone to store certain information about your use of the Leap Motion Site or Leap Motion Services. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer or phone until you delete them). We may collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage and application data caches.</p>

<p>So that Leap Motion can provide services, such as version upgrades and app recommendations, we may passively collect information that identifies your mobile device, such as the International Mobile Equipment Identity, IP address, and Android ID. Leap Motion may also automatically collect data about apps you have installed and the frequency of their use. We may collect details of how you used the Leap Motion Services, such as your browsing behaviors and search queries.</p>

<p>We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information. We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information at our discretion. “Anonymous Information” means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information.</p>

<p>Any feedback you provide will be governed by the Terms of Use.</p>

<h3>Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>

<p>We will not share any Personal Information with any of our app developer partners.</p>

<p>If we or our assets related to this Privacy Policy are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Law Enforcement Compliance</h3>
