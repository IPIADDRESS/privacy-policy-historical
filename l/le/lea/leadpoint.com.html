collects personally identifiable information from all Lead Originators and Lead
Buyers (collectively "Clients") wishing to work with us. The
collection of this information is a part of our normal business practices.
Clients or their representatives will be asked to provide personally
identifiable data through the host sign up and registration process. Examples
of personally identifiable data that may be requested include name, address,
phone number, email address, social security number, tax ID number, credit card
number, etc. LeadPoint will never request or collect data from a Client on
subject areas including medical/health conditions; racial or ethnic origin;
political, religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliations; trade union
membership or sex life.</span></p>

such data are required.</span></p>

identifiable information of third parties that Clients have collected for
transmittal to other Clients. Each Client has agreed that it has provided
notice to, and obtained consent from, any third party individuals whose
personal data it supplies to LeadPoint with regard to: (a) the purposes for
which such third party's personal data has been collected; (b) the intended
recipients or categories of recipients of the third party's personal data; (c)
which of the third party's data are obligatory and which data, if any, are
voluntary; and (d) how the third party can access and, if necessary, rectify
the data held about them. LeadPoint may transmit such third party personally
identifiable information to the intended recipients or categories of recipients
as requested by such third party.</span></p>

to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, LeadPoint is not
responsible for the information practices of Clients or their partners. The
collection, use, and disclosure of information by Clients and partners are
subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from LeadPoint's
policy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:11.25pt;line-height:14.25pt;background:

personally identifiable information in order to communicate via email
newsletters or other avenues to offer information and other communications to
assist in business related activities. In the event that a Client wishes not to
have their personally identifiable information used for these purposes, they
may elect to opt-out from future communications. For more information on
opting-out please see the "Client Choice And Access" section below.</span></p>

and a Client, all personally identifiable information data provided by
individual Clients will be kept in strict confidence by LeadPoint and will be
treated with the same level of respect and care that they treat other
proprietary information and trade secrets. LeadPoint will never sell, rent,
exchange or barter any personally identifiable Client information to or with
any third party for financial gain or marketing purposes. LeadPoint may, from
time to time, provide such information to certain third-party administrative
vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative or program
management services such as billing, delivery and payouts. Any third-party
vendor so used has agreed to protect the confidentiality of information
provided by LeadPoint.</span></p>

companies and organizations for fraud protection.</span></p>

LeadPoint, personally identifiable information is required as a part of doing
business. LeadPoint's primary intent in collecting personally identifiable
information is for administrative purposes including accounting and payouts.
However, LeadPoint may periodically use personally identifiable information for
marketing and communication purposes targeted to our Clients. Clients wishing
not to receive such communications from LeadPoint may do so by
"opting-out" during the registration and application procedure
process. A Client may change their "opt" status at anytime during
their tenure with LeadPoint by accessing their online account.</span></p>

LeadPoint reporting system, a "Cookie" is placed within their
computer. The purpose of the Cookie is to allow LeadPoint to validate the
identity of the Client and maintain the security and privacy of the Client's
account data. This Cookie is required to log into LeadPoint's reporting systems
and there is no method to opt-out of this Cookie.</span></p>

to the confidentiality of Client data, allowing access only to those employees
or third parties who have a need to know such information. LeadPoint routinely
evaluates its data security practices to identify security threats or
opportunities for improvement.</span></p>
