<p>We at HubSpot (HubSpot, Inc. and our affiliates, including Leadin) are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to both our leadin.com website (Website) and your use of our installable Leadin WordPress plugin (Plugin). This Privacy Policy governs our data collection, processing and usage practices. By using the Website or the Plugin, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the data practices described in this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Website or Plugin.<br>
We periodically update this Privacy Policy. If you have the Plugin installed on your WordPress.org site, you will receive notice when this Privacy Policy is modified. The notice will be delivered to the email address we collected when you installed the Plugin. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy Periodically.</p>
<h3>1. Important Information</h3>
<p><strong> 1.1. Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting a new version online. You should check this page occasionally to review any changes. If we make any material changes we will notify you by posting the revised Privacy Policy on our Website and, if you have the Plugin installed on your WordPress.org site, providing notice to the email address we have collected when you installed the Plugin. This helps you to always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, it is disclosed. Your continued use of the Website, Plugin, and/or continued provision of Personal Information to us will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>1.2. Contact Us</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our treatment of the information you provide us, please write to us by email at privacy@hubspot.com or by mail to HubSpot, Inc., 25 First Street, 2nd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA, Attn: Privacy.</p>
<h3>2. Use of the Plugin</h3>
<p><strong>2.1. The Plugin</strong></p>
<p>Our Plugin allows users to keep track of visitors to their websites, including information those visitors submit via forms on their websites. This information, which is stored and managed on our users’ own servers, is then used so that the visitors can be contacted about their interest in the company’s goods or services and interact with the company. We provide the Plugin to our customers for their own marketing and lead generation, and we use it on our Website for our own marketing and lead generation.</p>
<p><strong>2.2. Use by HubSpot</strong></p>
<p>We use our own Plugin to track visitors to our Website. Information that we collect and manage using the Plugin for our own marketing belongs to us and is used, disclosed and protected according to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>2.3. Use by our Customers</strong></p>
<p>Our customers use the Plugin to keep track of visitors to their websites. We do not control the content of our users’ webpages or the types of information that our customers may choose to collect or manage using the Plugin. That information belongs to them and is used, disclosed and protected by them according to their privacy policies and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. We have no direct relationship with individuals who provide Personal Information to our customers. Our customers control and are responsible for correcting, deleting or updating information they have collected from you using the Plugin. We are not responsible for our customers’ use of information they collect in the Plugin.</p>
<h3>3. Information We Collect</h3>
<p><strong>3.1. When You Visit our Website</strong></p>
<p>You are free to explore the Website without providing any information about yourself. When you visit the Website or register for the Plugin, we request that you provide Personal Information about yourself, and we collect Navigational Information.</p>
<p><strong>3.2. “Personal Information”</strong></p>
<p>This refers to any information that you voluntarily submit to us and that identifies you personally, including contact information, such as your name, e-mail address, company name, address, phone number, and other information about yourself or your business. Personal Information can also include information about any transactions, both free and paid, that you enter into on the Website, and information about you that is available on the internet, such as from Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Google, or publicly available information that we acquire from service providers.</p>
<p><strong>3.3. “Navigational Information”</strong></p>
<p>This refers to information about your computer and your visits to this website such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and pages viewed. Please see the “Navigation Information” section below.</p>
<p><strong>3.4. Information About Children</strong></p>
<p>The Website is not intended for or targeted at children under 13, and we do not knowingly or intentionally collect information about children under 13. If you believe that we have collected information about a child under 13, please contact us at privacy@hubspot.com, so that we may delete the information.</p>
<h3>4. How We Use Information We Collect</h3>
<p><strong>4.1. Compliance with Our Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we collect only in compliance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>4.2. We Never Sell Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We will never sell your Personal Information to any third party.</p>
<p><strong>4.3. Use of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may use your Personal Information to: (a) improve your browsing experience by personalizing the Website and to improve the Plugin; (b) send information to you which we think may be of interest to you by post, email, or other means; (c) send you marketing communications relating to our business or the businesses of carefully-selected third parties which we think may be of interest to you, and (d) provide other companies with statistical information about our users — but this information will not be used to identify any individual user. We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, we do not transfer your unique Personal Information to the third party. In addition, we may share data with trusted partners to contact you based on your request to receive such communications, help us perform statistical analysis, or provide customer support. Such third parties are prohibited from using your Personal Information except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p>
<p><strong>4.4. Use of Navigational Information</strong></p>
<p>We use Navigational Information to operate and improve the Website and the Plugin. We may also use Navigational Information alone or in combination with Personal Information to provide you with personalized information about HubSpot.</p>
<p><strong>4.5. Customer Testimonials and Comments</strong></p>
<p>We post customer testimonials and comments on our Website, which may contain Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>4.6. Service Providers</strong></p>
<p>We employ other companies and people to provide services to visitors to our Website, our customers, and users of the Plugin and may need to share your information with them to provide information, products or services to you. Examples may include removing repetitive information from prospect lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, supplementing the information you provide us in order to provide you with better service, and providing customer service. In all cases where we share your information with such agents, we explicitly require the agent to acknowledge and adhere to our privacy and customer data handling policies.</p>
<p><strong>4.7. Security of your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We secure the Personal Information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>4.8. Social Media Features</strong></p>
<p>Our Website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button, and Widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these features. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy and other policies of the companies providing them.</p>
<p><strong>4.9. External Websites</strong></p>
<p>Our Website provides links to other websites. We do not control, and are not responsible for, the content or practices of these other websites. Our provision of such links does not constitute our endorsement of these other websites, their content, their owners, or their practices. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these other websites, which are subject to any privacy and other policies they may have.</p>
<p><strong>4.10. Public Forums</strong></p>
<p>We offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose any information through our public message boards, blogs, or forums, this information may be collected and used by others. We will correct or delete any information you have posted on the Website if you so request, as described in “Opting Out and Unsubscribing” below.</p>
<p><strong>4.11. Retention of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We retain Personal Information that you provide us as long as we consider it potentially useful in contacting you about the Plugin or our other services, and then we securely delete the information. We will delete this information from the servers at an earlier date if you so request, as described in “Opting Out and Unsubscribing” below. If you provide information to our customers as part of their use of the Plugin, our customers decide how long to retain the personal information they collect from you.</p>
<p><strong>4.12. International Transfer of Information</strong></p>
<p>To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access Personal Information from around the world, including the United States. This Privacy Policy shall apply even if we transfer Personal Information to other countries.</p>
<p><strong>4.13. Corporate Events</strong></p>
<p>If we (or our assets) are acquired by another company, whether by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or otherwise, that company would receive all information gathered by HubSpot on the Website.</p>
<p><strong>4.15. Compelled Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to use or disclose your Personal Information if required by law or if we reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to comply with a law, court order, or legal process.</p>
<h3>5. Navigational Information</h3>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">5.1. Cookies</span></strong></p>
<p>We use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages on our Website, or register for the Plugin, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. When you return to the same Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the customized features.</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Plugin or Website you visit. HubSpot keeps track of the Website and pages you visit within the Plugin, in order to determine what portion of the Website or Plugin is the most popular or most used. This data is used to deliver customized content and promotions within the Website and Plugin to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>
<p><strong>5.2. Log Files</strong></p>
<p>There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by us. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by us for the operation of the Plugin, to maintain quality of the Plugin, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Website. For these purposes, we do link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information such as name, email address, address, and phone number.</p>
<p><strong>5.3. Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong></p>
<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage the Website and Plugin by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs in emails to our customers’ Personal Information. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Opting Out and Unsubscribing”.</p>
<p><strong>5.4. Navigational Information Collected by Our Customers</strong></p>
<p>Our customers can use the tools we provide, as well as tools provided by third parties, to collect Navigational Information when you visit their webpages. HubSpot does not control our customers’ use of these tools, nor do we control the information they collect or how they use it.</p>
<p><strong>5.5. Flash Cookies and Other Third Party Tracking Technologies</strong></p>
<p>The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your Web browser. This technology creates locally stored objects that are often referred to as “Flash cookies.” HubSpot does not use Flash cookies. However, customers of our Plugin may create pages that employ Adobe Flash cookies. HubSpot does not have access or control over our customers’ Flash cookies, but you may access your Flash management tools from Adobe’s web site directly. Similarly, our customers may create pages that use technology from tracking utility companies, such as cookies and web beacons. The use of these technologies by our customers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies.</p>
<p><strong>5.6. Third Party Tracking Technologies</strong></p>
<p>The use of cookies and web beacons by any tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies</p>
<h3>6. Opting Out and Unsubscribing</h3>
<p><strong>6.1. Reviewing, Correcting and Removing Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>If you provide us with your Personal Information, you have the following rights with respect to that information:<br>
To review the user information that you have supplied to us<br>
To request that we correct any errors, outdated information, or omissions in user information that you have supplied to us<br>
To request that your user information not be used to contact you<br>
To request that your user information be removed from any solicitation list that we use<br>
To request that your user information be deleted from our records<br>
To opt out of being solicited by HubSpot or third parties<br>
To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@hubspot.com or by mail to HubSpot, Inc., 25 First Street, 2nd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA, Attention: Privacy. We will promptly change, correct, or delete your information and notify you of the action we have taken.</p>
<p><strong>6.2. To Unsubscribe From Our Communications</strong></p>
<p>You may unsubscribe from our marketing communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of our e-mails, or by sending us email us at privacy@hubspot.com, or by sending us postal mail to HubSpot, Inc., 25 First Street, 2nd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA, Attention: Privacy. Customers cannot opt out of receiving transactional emails related to their account with us or the Plugin.</p>
<p><strong>6.3. To Unsubscribe from Our Customers’ Communications</strong></p>
<p>Our customers are solely responsible for their own marketing emails and other communications; we cannot unsubscribe you from their communications. You can unsubscribe from our customers’ marketing communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of their emails, or by contacting them directly.</p>
