If you do not agree to any of these terms, you should not use the Service. This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both users who are simply viewing content available via the Service and users who have registered as members of LearnSocial.</p><p>We may, at our sole discretion, modify this Privacy Policy at any time. This Privacy Policy was last modified as of March 2, 2012.</p><p>Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Privacy Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.</p><br><br><h4>Usage of User Personal Information</h4><hr><ul><li>When your register with us and become a LearnSocial Member, when you choose to teach or attend a class, we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address and Location.</li><li>If you decide to host a class on LearnSocial, we would ask you to provide your Bank Account details. These details (Account Number, Bank Branch etc) will be used only for the express purpose of transferring money to your account after you have hosted a class and we receive payments from learners. The platform doesn’t store or handle the Credit/Debit card details that are entered during online payments for classes. All payments are routed to a highly secure Payment Gateway that is governed by strict norms for handling and encrypting secure data.</li><li>We will protect personal information by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.</li><li>For effective communication from LearnSocial, we need your e-mail address. To provide you with additional services, we may also request your name, zipcode, and telephone number. We may give some or all of this information to the teachers for classes that you sign up for so that they can better coordinate their classes. We will not give your name, email, or other personal information to unaffiliated third parties except with your consent or as otherwise set forth in this privacy policy. In addition, we may provide personal information to employees, consultants or other business or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. In such circumstances, we require that these parties agree to protect the confidentiality of such information and to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</li><li>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Service, and to analyze traffic patterns on the Service. We use cookies, web beacons and similar technology to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit. We may also use web beacons and similar technology in emails that we send to you in order to track whether the emails have been opened. In addition, our web servers track information about the visits to the Service. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to the Service, the daily requests we receive for particular files on the Service, and what geographical areas those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others.</li><li>For example, if you choose to sign up for a free LearnSocial account, you may have a Profile page on the site, containing your Full Name and some basic information including your location and bio. You may also add additional optional information to your Profile. You may control what type of Profile information is shown to other through your Account Settings. Any information you choose to provide as part of your profile should reflect how much you want other LearnSocial users to know about you.

You can review and revise your profile information at any time.</li><li>You must be at least 16 years old to register to use the Service. </li><li>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Service.
