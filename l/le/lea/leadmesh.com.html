    <td colspan="2"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Leadmesh, a Division of Sound Advertising Group (SAG),  complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S.  Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal  information from European Union member countries.&nbsp; SAG has certified that it adheres to the Safe  Harbor Privacy Principals of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data  integrity, access, and enforcement.&nbsp; To  learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification page,  please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a><br>
      <br>
      We have prepared this  Privacy Policy to enable you to understand which personal information of yours  is collected, how and when we might use your information, how we protect your  information, who has access to your information, and how you can correct any  inaccuracies in the information. This Privacy Policy is not intended to and  does not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any  party.<br>
  <strong><br>
    Personal Information</strong><br>
      On some pages of our clients’  websites, users can register to purchase products or services, receive  personalized content and participate in surveys or forums. When you register, you  may be asked for some “Personal Information” which may include, but may not be  limited to, your full name, postal address, phone number and email address. You  may be contacted with information about the company’s products and services.<br>
      If you purchase  products or services, we may also request financial information such as credit  card or bank account information. Any financial information collected is used  only to bill you for the products and services you purchased. If you purchase  by credit card, this information may be forwarded to your credit card provider.<br>
  <strong><br>
    How data is  transmitted to Leadmesh</strong><br>
      Leadmesh is proprietary hosted software developed by Sound  Advertising Group in Seattle, Washington, USA.&nbsp;  This product/service is essentially a portal or conduit that allows  companies who provide a variety of offers (auto loans, education inquiries,  Payday Loans for example) on the Internet to post the data they collect to  potential 3rd party buyers or providers of such services.&nbsp; Leadmesh facilitates the distribution of  collected data.&nbsp; Leadmesh respects the  privacy of the data that is collected, and as a result, we have developed this  website privacy policy.&nbsp; The website  privacy applies only to the operation of websites and clients that post data  directly in to us for real-time distribution.<br>
      <br>
      When a form, survey or application is completed on one of  our clients websites the information is posted to Leadmesh automatically.&nbsp; And, based on pre-set filters and  intelligence that are established by or for our clients in advance, that information  posts OUT to one or more potential buyers almost instantly.&nbsp; The systems receiving the information make a  determination (based on pre-set criteria and possible validation) of whether or  not they find the information credible.&nbsp;  Within seconds, their systems respond back to Leadmesh with an  electronic Success or Fail message.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      A  successful response means they will “act” upon the information provided on the  web page by agreeing to provide the service to the applicant.&nbsp;&nbsp; A fail response means something in the  application is incorrect or the applicant may not qualify for the particular  loan or offer.&nbsp; For example, in the case  of a short term loan, a person finds a website that offers the service.&nbsp; They complete the application and click  “submit.”&nbsp; The data posts IN to Leadmesh  then out to a potential lender/buyer with the “lead.”&nbsp; If you qualify, their system responds to our  system with a unique code (URL) where we provide you (on the original website  partner’s behalf) with the opportunity to complete the transaction via an  e-signature page.&nbsp; Once that is complete,  the lender wires the funds to your bank account.&nbsp; If it fails, we try another lender or provide  a page that informs the client they didn’t qualify for the loan.<br>
  <strong><br>
    Client adherence to  regulations</strong><br>
      Prior to accepting any new clients, we provide them with an  Agreement to our Terms and Conditions which must be signed by an agent  authorized to enter into such agreements.&nbsp;&nbsp;  We place an emphasis on the legality of solicitation of information as  it pertains to the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.&nbsp;  It reads as follows:<br>
      <br>
  <strong>“Partner Data” </strong>shall mean information  input into the Software interface by Partner. </font></p>
      
  <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>PARTNER AND AFFILIATE POLICY  REQUIREMENTS. </strong><br>
          Each party and its Affiliates  must meet the minimum basic requirements listed below to qualify to participate  using the Leadmesh Service: </font>
  
    
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No violations of the federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended form time  to time (the “CAN-SPAM Act”). </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No racial, ethnic, political, hate-mongering or otherwise objectionable  content. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No Software Pirating (e.g., Warez) or Hacking. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No use of Leadmesh URLs in emails. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No activity in violation of applicable Federal law. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You may contact Leadmesh to arrange for Leadmesh to review  questionable campaigns for compliance prior to campaign launch. Campaigns will  be deemed acceptable to Leadmesh on a case by case basis. Partner shall comply  with the CAN-SPAM Act when sending Leadmesh URLs (code) to Partner’s  subscribers or, if Partner’s Affiliates are sending newsletters or mailing list  emails, then the Affiliate must comply with the CAN-SPAM Act when sending such  newsletters or emails with Leadmesh code in the email. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Leadmesh does not permit non-compliance with the CAN-SPAM  Act. If Partner’s domain is listed on SpamHaus, and SpamHaus will not remove  the Partner’s domain, Leadmesh will take appropriate steps to assist the  Partner in finding a resolution. If a resolution cannot be found by the  parties, Partner must be removed from Leadmesh’s IP space within 2 weeks from  the date that written notice is provided to Partner by Leadmesh. If Partner  does not remove itself from Leadmesh’s IP space within such 2-week time period,  then Leadmesh reserves the right to terminate the Agreement (and Partner's use  of the Site and/or the Services) immediately, without liability to Leadmesh and  within 30 days of termination Leadmesh will transfer all Partner Data to  Partner. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You and your Affiliates must be in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act.  Unless otherwise stated in this section 1, Leadmesh reserves the right to ask  Partner to cure the violation or it may provide Partner with 14 days notice of  termination. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to the above, we require all of our clients to adhere to a  Suppression List and Opt-out notification on all unsolicited emails.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Additional  Information</strong><br>
        As a security measure  and to ensure that our website and computer network remain available to all  customers, SAG and Leadmesh may use software programs to monitor network  traffic or to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information,  or otherwise cause damage. These software programs may also collect information  regarding your use of our website and computer network. <br>
        You may also be asked  to disclose Personal Information to us so that we can provide technical support  assistance and information to you. For example, we may collect Personal  Information from you (such as an e-mail address, system information and problem  descriptions) in order to provide online technical support and troubleshooting.  If you choose to correspond with us through electronic communication (e.g.  email, online chat or instant messaging), we may retain a copy of the  electronic communication together with your email address and our responses. We  provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ  in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone. <br>
  <strong><br>
    Server Hosting Data  Collection</strong><br>
        As a server hosting  service provider, SAG provides access to servers (which are located in the  United States) for customers around the globe to store and manage their data  and applications. Neither SAG nor Leadmesh owns this specific data and is not a  “controller” as outlined in the EU Directive. To the extent that any of our  customers or our client’s customers are exposed to customer or user data, SAG  and Leadmesh adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.<br>
  <strong><br>
    Information  Released</strong><br>
        SAG and Leadmesh may  release some customer Non-Personally Identifiable information, the website’s  traffic patterns, and related website usage information to our affiliates and  reputable third parties on an aggregated basis. We take measures to select  product or service providers that are responsible and afford similar privacy  protections to their customers. However, we do not make any representations  about the practices and policies of these companies.<br>
        Leadmesh may share or  disclose Personal Information with Agents (“Agents” are persons or companies  who act on behalf of or under the instructions of Leadmesh) in connection with  administering or delivering Leadmesh products and services. Prior to disclosing  Personal Information to its Agents, Leadmesh will either: (a) ensure that the  Agent subscribes to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, (b) assess whether the  Agent is subject to the EU Directive, (c) determine that the Agent complies  with another “adequacy” finding or (d) execute a written agreement with the  Agent requiring the Agent to provide at least the same level of privacy  protection as the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. Leadmesh will not otherwise  disclose your personally information to third parties without first obtaining  your consent pursuant to the Opt-In and Opt-Out Provisions below.<br>
  <strong><br>
    SPECIAL CASES OF  RELEASE</strong><br>
        Both Personal Information and Non-Personally Identifiable information may be  transferred to a third party:</font></p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As required by law, in a matter of       public safety or policy, or as compelled by a court of law</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the event of a change of       ownership or assets; and</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To affiliated entities of common       control, such as subsidiaries and parent companies. The use of your       information by these affiliates of common control will comply with this       Privacy Policy.</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
        SAG websites as well  as most of the Leadmesh client websites uses cookies (i.e., small bits of text  that our servers place into a file on your computer’s hard drive).&nbsp; &nbsp;Cookies  are used to save your preferences and login information, and provide  personalized functionality. Cookies may also store Personal Information  (defined below) you have entered so that you do not have to continually reenter  the same information. You can reject cookies by changing your browser settings,  but be aware that this will disable some of the functionality on the website  you would be accessing.<br>
        SAG and Leadmesh may  also allow third party advertisers on our website to send cookies, but these  advertisers do not have access to read SAG or Leadmesh cookies. Other company’s  use of their cookies are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.<br>
  <strong><br>
    Contacting  You Directly</strong><br>
        Leadmesh customers may  contact you directly through the email address or other information you provide  to confirm information or purchases we have successfully received from you. Leadmesh  customers may also contact you to respond to your questions, to provide the  services you request, to manage your account, and/or to inform you of any  service announcements.<br>
  <strong><br>
    Opt-Out  Provision </strong><br>
        If you don’t want to  receive promotional materials from our marketing partners, you may opt out at  any time. You may “opt out” by clicking on the box marked “I DO NOT WISH TO  RECEIVE SPECIAL COMMUNICATIONS FROM (Name and address of company)” when you  register for an account or at any time afterwards by contacting them  directly.&nbsp; If you don’t get a timely  response from them, please contact us at <a href="mailto:.info@leadmesh.com">info@leadmesh.com</a> . &nbsp;When properly opting-out, our clients  should take reasonable efforts to delete a user’s Personal Information from its  database. However, please note that it may be impossible to entirely delete a  user’s Personal Information because some residual information may reside on  backups or records of deletions.<br>
        Leadmesh customers  should always offer you the opportunity to opt out before your Personal  Information is:</font></p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">disclosed to a third party that is       not an Agent of Leadmesh; or</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">used for a purpose that is       inconsistent with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected (as       we have explicitly described to you in this Privacy Policy or at the time       you provided such information) or as you subsequently authorized.</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        Additionally, if a user’s Personal Information to be disclosed or used in the  above situations is “Sensitive Information” (i.e. Personal Information specifying  medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,  religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information  specifying the sex life of the individual), Leadmesh customers should first  obtain your explicit consent by requiring you to “opt in” prior to such uses or  disclosures of Sensitive Information.<br>
  <strong><br>
    Third  Party Sites</strong><br>
        Leadmesh client’s websites  may include links, ad banners, etc. to other websites which may or may not be  affiliated with them. Notwithstanding any affiliation, Leadmesh does NOT  control and is NOT responsible for the information and/or content you provide  to and transactions you engage in with such third party sites. Please be aware  that the operators of these other websites may collect and use different  information about you that is not consistent with Leadmesh Privacy Policy. For  any concerns as to the privacy of your information on these websites, please  refer to their respective privacy policies.<br>
  <strong><br>
    Children</strong><br>
        In accordance with  the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), Leadmesh does not  knowingly collect or solicit any Personal Information from children under the  age of thirteen (13).<br>
  <strong><br>
    How  We Protect Your Information </strong><br>
        SAG has employed the  use of electronic security measures to protect against the loss, theft, misuse,  alteration, or unauthorized disclosure of your information submitted to our  website. These measures include firewalls, use of passwords, anti-virus and  detection software.<br>
        When we ask customers  or users to provide financial information (such as a credit card number) that  data is protected using Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) technology. However,  please note that electronic communication (e.g. email, online chat or instant  messaging) that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you in  advance that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the  information. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential  information such as financial information, social security numbers or passwords  to us through unsecured electronic communication. <br>
  <strong><br>
    Content  Placed In Public</strong><br>
        Some pages of Leadmesh  customers websites may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups or  instant messaging available to you. Please remember that any information  disclosed in these areas is public. You should exercise caution when disclosing  Personal Information in these areas. Don’t disclose information in these public  forums that might be considered confidential and such as financial information,  social security numbers, passwords or email addresses. Users should be aware  that when they voluntarily disclose Personal Information on the bulletin boards  or in the chat areas, that information and any substantive information  disclosed in the communication can be collected and used by third parties. This  could result in unsolicited messages from others who post on such sites and are  beyond the control of Leadmesh.<br>
        You represent and  warrant that posting content to any public area of Leadmesh clients’ websites  will not infringe or violate the rights, including but not limited to  intellectual property rights, such as copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade  secrets and rights of privacy and publicity of any third party.<br>
  <strong><br>
    Transfer  of Data Abroad</strong><br>
        If you are visiting the  website of a Leadmesh customer from a country other than the countries in which  our servers are located (currently the United States), the various  communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across  international boundaries. By visiting their website and communicating  electronically with them, you consent to the processing and transfer of your  data as set out in this Privacy Policy.<br>
  <strong><br>
    Access  to Your Personal Information and Correction of Inaccuracies</strong><br>
        If you wish to access  and/or update the Personal Information that has been collected from you, you  may either a) as a registered user, log onto the Leadmesh client website and  view or change your information online or b) contact them directly at the  address they provide on their site or c) contact us at <a href="mailto:info@leadmesh.com">info@leadmesh.com</a>.&nbsp; Personal information may reside on our  servers for up to seven years and no less than two years.<br>
  <strong><br>
    Modifications  to the Privacy Policy</strong><br>
        Leadmesh hereby  reserves the right to amend, alter, modify, replace or suspend this Privacy  Policy, from time to time, in its sole discretion. All such changes to this Privacy  Policy will be effective when posted on the Leadmesh website and noted with the  most recent date of the amendment to the policy.<br>
  <strong><br>

        Sound Advertising  Group uses a self-assessment approach to ensure compliance with this Privacy  Policy and periodically verifies that the Privacy Policy is accurate,  comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently  displayed, completely implemented and accessible and in conformity with the  Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. </font></p>
