					<li>in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;</li>
					<li>if LR or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets;</li>
					<li>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use or terms and conditions of supply and other agreements; or</li>
					<li>to protect the rights, property, or safety of LR, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
