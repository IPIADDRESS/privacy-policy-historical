            <b>LeagueSafe.com Privacy Policy</b><br>
            LeagueSafe has created this privacy statement to help you (hereafter, "Members")
            understand the ways in which Members' personal information is gathered and used.
            At LeagueSafe, we recognize the importance of the confidentiality of the information
            we receive. This statement describes the information Members provide to LeagueSafe,
            LLC including our affiliates, partners, and agencies (collectively, "LeagueSafe").
            This privacy policy outlines the manner in which we collect information, how we
            use it, and any circumstances in which we may disclose it. By accepting the privacy
            policy and Terms of Service during registration, Members expressly consent to LeagueSafe's
            use and disclosure of Member's personal information as described in the Privacy
            Statement. If this document is updated, Members are notified on their Member Home
            Page for 30 days after the revision has taken effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Information Collection</b><br>
            LeagueSafe requests only the information needed to administer our business, and
            to provide customers with products and services. LeagueSafe will not give, sell,
            rent, or share this information to other parties, except as described in this privacy
            policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>How We Gather Your Personal Information</b><br>
            When Members visit the LeagueSafe site, we collect standard web logging information,
            such as Members' browser type, IP address, and a record of the pages Members access.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Members choose to register for the LeagueSafe Membership, they are asked to
            provide their name, address, email and other similar information. Financial information
            that is used for transaction processing, such as credit card information and/or
            bank information, is not stored by LeagueSafe. In order to comply with federal and
            state laws, banking regulations, and other guidelines to minimize risk and authenticate
            Member identity, Members may be required to offer additional information in order
            to verify identity or address. This may include Members' social security number
            or other personal information. LeagueSafe may also obtain information about Members
            from third parties such as identity verification services. LeagueSafe interacts
            with its Members via surveys and other means, and in these processes, information
            may be collected.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Session Information</b><br>
            LeagueSafe gathers IP addresses, browser types, and session information in order
            to administer the site, improve performance, and evaluate Member trends. The information
            is gathered and aggregated for broad analysis, and is stored for less than three
            years from the date collected.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>How We Use Cookies</b><br>
            In many parts of the LeagueSafe website, "cookies" are placed on Members' computer.
            These help LeagueSafe provide an improved user experience in many situations. Many
            cookies are used only during a Member's contiguous session; others may expire in
            24 hours. Many browsers have controls that limit the use of cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Customer Service Correspondence</b><br>
            Correspondence with Members, including emails and faxes, may be retained. We retain
            these records in order to improve customer service, investigate possible fraud or
            criminal activities, monitor violations of LeagueSafe's Terms of Service, and to
            otherwise protect LeagueSafe's legal interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Information Sharing</b><br>
            LeagueSafe will not give, sell, rent, or share this information to other parties
            for their marketing purposes. In an effort to maintain validate the authenticity
            of each Member transaction, LeagueSafe may validate personal information Members
            provide, or request additional information from credit bureaus or other third parties,
            to assist us in establishing and authenticating a Member's account, and verifying
            the accuracy of the information that Members provide. Information obtained from
            third parties and linked with your personal information is safeguarded by confidentiality
            agreements and to the extent required by law.
        </p>
        <p>
            When LeagueSafe Members sign up for a third-party service, we share only the contact
            information that is necessary for the third party to provide such services. For
            example, if a Member applies for a LeagueSafe prepaid card, the Member is authorizing
            LeagueSafe and the issuer of the LeagueSafe card to exchange information the Member
            provides in the online application form. If the member is approved, the member's
            account will be governed by the issuing bank's privacy policy. Third parties are
            not authorized to use personal information except for the purpose of providing those
            services. Otherwise, LeagueSafe will not share or give Members' personal information
            to others unless in the rare case that LeagueSafe believes it is necessary to cooperate
            with regulators or law enforcement authorities or similar legal request including
            the protection of our rights or the rights of others. If a Member objects to personal
            information being transferred or used as described in this Privacy Statement, please
            do not register to use the LeagueSafe service or use this website.
        </p>
        <p>

            <br>
            The LeagueSafe site may contain links to other sites, including links left by other
            Members in your league, on the league message board. Message board entries are not

            username and password, to access account information and transaction reporting,
            and to initiate or process transactions directly from the Website. LeagueSafe does
            not store Member's personal financial information.
        </p>
        <p>
            We make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. Despite our efforts,
            we cannot guarantee that personal information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered
            or destroyed by breach of our administrative, managerial and technical safeguards.
            If a Member believes that to have been involved in an unauthorized transaction,
            contact LeagueSafe by sending an email to customerservice@leaguesafe.com.
        </p>
        <p>
            If LeagueSafe learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify affected
            Members electronically so they can take appropriate protective steps. By using the
            LeagueSafe service, Members agree that LeagueSafe may communicate with Members electronically.
            LeagueSafe may post a notice on this Website if a security breach occurs. If this
            happens, Members will need a web browser enabling Members to view the LeagueSafe.com
            website. LeagueSafe may also send Members an email at the email address you have
            provided to us. Depending on where each Member lives, Members may have a legal right
            to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice
            of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice
            of a security breach) Members should notify us at customerservice@leaguesafe.com.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>International Use</b><br>
            As described in the LeagueSafe Terms of Service, LeagueSafe is available only to
            residents of the United States. By using the LeagueSafe service, Members expressly
            consent to the transfer and processing of personal information in the United States

            strives to meet the laws and practices of the United States. Residents from other
            countries should not use the service, and should not expect that laws and practices
            from their country will be adhered to.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Merger or Sale</b><br>
            In the event of a change of ownership control over LeagueSafe, information collected
            by LeagueSafe will be treated as an asset, and may be transferred except to the
            extent the law may prohibit such transfers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
            This document may change occasionally. When changes are made we will revise the
            effective date on the privacy policy. In the event that a change may be materially
            less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information, notification
            of the change will be made on Members' league home page for 30 days. A Member's
            continued use of the LeagueSafe web site and services constitutes an agreement to
