	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		
<p>Merriam-Webster is committed to respecting the privacy of visitors to
its Web sites. The guidelines below explain some of the steps we have
taken to protect the privacy of visitors to Merriam-Webster's LearnersDictionary.com and
its features.</p>

<p><b>Privacy and Personal Information </b><br>
Merriam-Webster protects the identity of visitors to Merriam-Webster's LearnersDictionary.com by limiting the collection of personal information. For certain
promotions and to access certain features, such as to receive a Word of
the Day subscription, we may request a voluntary submission of
information such as name, e-mail address, city, state, and age.</p>

<p>Merriam-Webster does not knowingly collect or solicit personally
identifying information from or about children under 13, except as
permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from
a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that
information immediately. If you believe Merriam-Webster has any
information from or about anyone under 13, please e-mail us at the
Comments and Suggestions address listed on our <a href="/contact.htm">Contact Us</a> page.</p>

<p>All personally identifying information collected through
Merriam-Webster's LearnersDictionary.com is used by Merriam-Webster and its staff to
process and manage subscriptions, track site usage patterns and
statistics, or to deliver services through the site; such information
may also be used by the company for market research or for prize or
information-request fulfillment unless otherwise indicated. Such
information will not be posted or published by us, and, except as
specified below in this privacy policy regarding anonymous aggregated
data, or to provide services to you on behalf of Merriam-Webster's LearnersDictionary.com, it will not be provided to third-party providers without
consent.</p>

<p>
If you choose to provide personally identifying information to us, you may receive the following types of e-mails from us:
</p><ul>
<li>E-mails related to subscription-maintenance activities. 
</li><li>Periodic e-mail newsletters highlighting new features, content, and usage tips for Merriam-Webster's LearnersDictionary.com. 
</li><li>Periodic special offers for additional Merriam-Webster and
Encyclopædia Britannica (Merriam-Webster's parent company) products and
services. </li><li>Periodic special offers from Merriam-Webster approved partners if you
"opt-in" or give us your permission to send them.</li></ul>
When you provide personally identifying information to us, you can let
us know that you do not wish to receive special Merriam-Webster or
partner offers. Each offer will also have information available to
allow you to "opt out" if you wish to receive no further offers.<p></p>

<p>Anonymous aggregated data may be provided to other companies we do
business with for statistical or market research purposes. For example,
we may report to advertisers that a certain percentage of our site's
users are adults between the ages of 25 and 35.</p>

<p>This site, Merriam-Webster's LearnersDictionary.com, may use the services of an
advertising agency for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions
and other marketing messages. To do this, the agency may collect
anonymous data through the use of cookies or by other means.</p>

<p>Merriam-Webster's LearnersDictionary.com may also use other third-party providers to
facilitate the delivery of the services described above, and these
third-party providers may be supplied with or have access to personally
identifying information for the sole purpose of providing these
services to you on behalf of Merriam-Webster's LearnersDictionary.com.</p>

<p>Merriam-Webster may also disclose personally identifying information in
special legal circumstances. For instance, such information may be used
where it is necessary to protect our copyright or intellectual property
rights, or if the law requires us to do so.</p>

<p>
