</p>
<ul>
    <li>us process all their personal data; and
    </li>
    <li>you receive any data protection notices for them.

</p>
<ul>
    <li>which data they must give;
    </li>
    <li>which information is voluntary; and
    </li>
    <li>how they can access and, if necessary, correct the data we hold about
    them.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>

    <li>where you heard about us;

</ul>
<p>
    We also request other information including your title, middle name, email

    provide this information, but if you do not, you may not get the most out
    of your learning. However, we ask you to tell us whether you have achieved
    Level 2 in English and Maths.
</p>
<p>
    Before you enrol, we will give you a username and ask you for a password.
    You will also be given a learner reference number and asked to give the
    answer to a question you choose which will identify you.

    funding.&nbsp; If you are not eligible then this information will be
    destroyed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>At enrolment</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We will call you at a time of your choice and check all the above details
    with you and may request additional information, such as where you heard
    about us and if you have done any learning in the last three
    years,&nbsp;other information we&nbsp;may collect is set out in this
    Privacy Statement. You will need a user name and password to access your
    course materials. Your user name is your email address and you can either
    choose your own password or we will give you one which you must change when
    you first log in. If you are already registered on the
    <strong>learndirect</strong> community you will use the&nbsp;same user name
    and password to access your learning.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Please note that when you enrol on a <strong>learndirect</strong> course
    that leads to a qualification such as an NVQ, we send non-sensitive
    personal information to the relevant awarding bodies so that they can
    undertake the administration associated with your qualification.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="3" name="3"></a>Other information we collect, if you enrol at a learning
        centre,&nbsp;to see if you can have government funding
</h3>
<p>
    If government funding is available for any of our courses, you need to
    answer some other questions to see if you are eligible for funding. If you
    wish to take advantage of any such funding, you will be asked about :
</p>
<ul>
    <li>your age;
    </li>
    <li>your education so far;
    </li>
    <li>your citizenship status; and
    </li>
    <li>where you live and how long you have lived there.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We, or our approved&nbsp;service providers, may require additional
    information from you in order to support an application for funding. If you
    do not want to provide us with this information, we will not be able to
    offer you the course at the reduced price.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="learner" name="learner"></a>Learner File
</h3>
<p>
    When you start your learning your we or&nbsp;Service Provider will create a
    Learner File to hold the documents which relate to your learning and
    evidence of proof of identity and funding eligibility. As you progress
    through your learning other documents, including some of your course work,
    may be held on this file.
</p>

        materials

    We collect information about how you use course materials to monitor your
    learning and improve our users' learning experience.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="5" name="5"></a>The information we collect when you enter competitions
</h3>
<p>
    From time to time we may run competitions and promotions on the website. If
    you enter these, we may ask for your name, address, email address and
    username so that we can administer and control the competition and, of
    course, notify the winners.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="6" name="6"></a>Other information we collect
</h3>
<p>

    <strong>learndirect</strong> centres are;
    </li>
    <li>Where you heard about us.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can also decide to give us your home and mobile telephone numbers and
    your email address but you only need to do this if you want us and/or our
    approved&nbsp;service providers to contact you about
    <strong>learndirect</strong> developments and offers in this way.
</p>
<p>
    If you are not registered as a <strong>learndirect</strong> learner but use
    one of our online tests to test your skills, we ask you to provide your
    full name and email address. This information is not retained by us but is
    used only when sending you your test results.<br>

    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    * We may record calls to helplines and communications via online tools for
    quality and training purposes only. We will store calls for about&nbsp;six

<h3>
    <a id="9" name="9"></a>Third parties and sponsors
</h3>
<p>
    To achieve the purposes set out in this privacy statement we may need to
    share your information and Learner File with our service providers
    (including our approved learning providers), agents, professional advisors
    and auditors and to your tutor(s). When you enrol on a course with a
    service provider in a <strong>learndirect</strong> centre, the service
    provider will be delivering and supporting your learning. Following
    enrolment via a centre or online, all of our approved service providers
    will have access to your name, date of birth, address, username, learner
    reference number and which <strong>learndirect</strong> courses you have
    enrolled on in the past as well as details relating to these
    <strong>learndirect</strong> courses to help us deliver our services to
    you. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    We may also give your information to third parties who may take over part
    or all of the <strong>learndirect</strong> business in the future, but only
    for the purposes outlined in this privacy statement. If your employer,
    trade organisation or other organisation is sponsoring or supporting you,
    we may give the personal information we have collected to your sponsor to
    monitor your learning.
</p>
<p>
    Communications between you and your tutor using any of the tools or
    functions we make available to you (including unopened messages sent via
    our messaging system) may be monitored by <strong>learndirect</strong>
    staff to check the quality of tutor support. <strong>learndirect</strong>
    staff and auditors may also access these communications when we want to
    investigate or audit learner funding arrangements.

    Referral Partners
</h3>
<p>
    If we have received your details as a referral from one of our partners we

    following areas:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Attendance

<h3>
    <a id="jcp" name="jcp"></a>Job Centre Plus Referrals
</h3>
<p>
    If we or our Service Providers receive your details via a Skills
    Conditionality Referral from Job Centre Plus we are obliged to keep them
    informed of your progress.&nbsp; We will complete a Starter/Leaver
    notification form that contains details of the course being taken, when
    started and an anticipated end date.&nbsp; You will be asked to sign this
    to confirm you have started the learning prior to it being sent to Job
    Centre Plus for processing.
</p>
<p>
    When you stop learning for whatever reason the remaining boxes of the
    Starter/Leaver notification form are completed and returned to Job Centre
    Plus.&nbsp; In certain circumstances this may result in sanctions being
    applied by Job Centre Plus, details of these are available from
    <a title="Direct Gov" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk&#10;">www.direct.gov.uk.</a>
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="10" name="10"></a>Keeping you informed
</h3>
<p>
    We, and our approved&nbsp;service providers, will use your information to
    send you regular updates about :
</p>
<ul>
    <li>our services and materials;
    </li>
    <li>additions to the website; and
    </li>
    <li>specific activities such as customer feedback surveys and competitions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you enrol on a <strong>learndirect</strong> course you will periodically
    be sent customer feedback surveys. If you&nbsp;do not wish to&nbsp;be
    contacted for marketing&nbsp;purposes untick the relevant boxes on the
    'contact permissions' page. If at any time, you change your mind about
    receiving updates, you can change your preferences using 'edit your
    details' on your learner home page.
</p>
<p>
    If you are simply requesting a free information pack, you can invite us to
    send you updates by ticking the appropriate boxes on the "request more
    information" page. If you change your mind about us contacting you for this
    purpose, please ring us on <strong>0800&nbsp;101&nbsp;901</strong> or
    <a href="mailto:enquiries@learndirect.net?Subject=Privacy%20Statement%20query">

</p>
<p>
    We will never use your sensitive personal data for marketing
    purposes&nbsp;without your express consent.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="11" name="11"></a>Funding
</h3>
<p>
    We, and our approved service providers, may use your personal data to
    process or to support any application made for funding associated with your
    learning. For these purposes we, or our approved service providers, will
    share the information you supply with the
    <a href="http://skillsfundingagency.bis.gov.uk/">Skills Funding Agency
    (SFA)</a> in England. The SFA may in turn share it with the European Social
    Fund, or other government agencies that may provide funding for your
    course, including the <a href="http://www.wales.gov.uk/">Welsh Assembly
    Government</a>&nbsp;for learners who enrol in Welsh centres. We may use a
    third party service to verify your identity for funding
    eligibility.&nbsp;If you are a learner between the ages of 16-19 years of
    age (or up to 25 years of age for learners with learning difficulties or
    disabilities), we are required by the Skills Funding Agency to notify
    Connexions when you leave, or intend to leave learning. We, or our
    approved&nbsp;service providers, may also share it with the Office for
    Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) so that it
    can check our use of public monies. If you do not want us to use your
    personal data for these purposes, we will not be able to offer you the
    course at the reduced price.
</p>
<p>
    At the point this information is collected you will be asked to indicate if
    you do not wish to be contacted by the SFA or its partners in respect of
    courses, surveys and research. Please read the&nbsp;SFA Data Protection
    Statement.
</p>
<p>
    We, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may use
    your personal data and Learner File to investigate a suspected misuse of
    public monies or other fraudulent activity by any person relating to your
    learning activity. In doing so, we, or the government agency providing
    funding for your course, may disclose your information to other government
    agencies (e.g. the <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/">Department for Work and
    Pensions</a>) to establish whether there has been any duplication of
    funding for your course. We may also contact you for the purposes of any
    such investigation.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>SFA Privacy Notice</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The SFA requires that we also tell you about its own privacy notice so that
    you understand how the SFA will use the information that we give
    them.&nbsp; It says:
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>How We Use Your Personal Information</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <em>The personal information you provide is passed to the Chief Executive
    of Skills Funding (“the Agency”) and, when needed, the Young People’s

    Agency’s Learning Records Service (LRS) to create and maintain a unique
    learner number (ULN). The information you provide may be shared with other
    partner organisations for purposes relating to education or training.</em>

<h3>
    <a id="12" name="12"></a>Statistics
</h3>
<p>
    We and/or the approved&nbsp;service providers delivering and supporting
    your learning are also required to provide statistics to all of the
    government agencies mentioned under the heading 'Funding' and to the
    <a title="" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/">Department for
       Business, Innovation and Skills</a>, in order that they can carry out
       checks on our funding arrangements and our performance and for research
       and statistical purposes. This helps us, and our approved service
       providers, to maintain our funding. Where such information is supplied,
       it is provided in an aggregated manner so that whilst such authorities
       may be aware of, for example, the number, geographic location and sex of
       persons using <strong>learndirect,</strong> you cannot be personally
       identified from this information.<br>
    However, we may provide information that identifies you (your name, date of
    birth, address and postcode) to the Department of Work and Pensions so that
    they can check whether <strong>learndirect</strong> learners have
    progressed into employment and compile statistical information about such
    progression. You will not be identifiable from the statistical information
    compiled.
</p>
<p>
    The information collected on Welsh speakers is passed in an aggregate
    manner to the Welsh Assembly. You cannot be personally identified from this
    information.
