<h3>8. How does learndirect use the information collected ?</h3>

<p><b>learndirect</b> uses your personal information for the purpose of responding to your queries or complaints, supporting your learning experience through our partners, providing <b>learndirect</b> Course Materials and any associated administration, for general statistical and research sampling purposes and for obtaining any relevant professional advice.  This may include disclosing your information to our service providers and agents for these purposes and to our auditors. The more information you provide, the more focused and customised we can make your learning experience. Personal data about you will be processed in accordance with this Privacy Statement. When you submit information to <b>learndirect</b> using any of the tools or functions <b>learndirect</b> makes available to you to support your learning, this information may be viewed by third parties such as <b>learndirect</b> staff or tutors.</p>

<p>Netbanx Ltd will use the personal information provided by you for the purposes of processing your online payment and will transmit your credit card details to your issuing bank or credit card company to confirm your payment.</p>

<p>For the purposes of administering the provision of learning to you, <b>learndirect</b> will share your personal information with <b>learndirect</b> providers who will be delivering and supporting your learning.  You will be informed of the identity of your <b>learndirect</b> provider when you enrol on a course.  We may also disclose your information to third parties who acquire the <b>learndirect</b> business in the future but only for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement.  If you are a <b>learndirect</b> member or learner taking part in training through or as a result of a scheme sponsored or organised by your employer, trade organisation or other group ("your Sponsor"), <b>learndirect</b> may disclose the personal information collected to your Sponsor in order to monitor your learning.</p>

<p><b>learndirect</b> and/or the <b>learndirect</b> providers delivering or supporting your learning will also send you regular updates on the <b>learndirect</b> service, up-to-date information about <b>learndirect</b> Materials, additions to the Website and information about specific activities such as customer feedback surveys and competitions, except to the extent you untick the boxes on the 'join us' page.  If at any time subsequently you do not wish to receive such updates, you can change you preferences from the 'my details' menu item on your learner home page. Sensitive data will not be used for marketing purposes without your further express consent.</p>

<p><b>learndirect</b> and/or the <b>learndirect</b> providers delivering or supporting your learning may use your personal data, including sensitive personal data, to process or to support any application which you have made for funding to help you pay for the costs of any full time or part time learning.  For these purposes, <b>learndirect</b> and/or the <b>learndirect</b> providers delivering or supporting your learning will share the information supplied by you with the <a href="http://www.lsc.gov.uk" title="visit the LSC website">Learning and Skills Council</a>, the <a href="http://www.ali.gov.uk" title="visit the Adult Learning Inspectorate website">Adult Learning Inspectorate</a> or other government agencies (as appropriate) for the purposes of funding you for your course.  In the event that you do not wish to provide the necessary information or consent to it being used for these purposes, we will not be able to offer you the course at the reduced price.</p>

<p><b>learndirect</b> and/or the <b>learndirect</b> providers delivering and supporting your learning are also required to provide statistics about persons enrolling for learning courses through <b>learndirect</b> to the <a href="http://www.lsc.gov.uk" title="visit the Learning and Skills Council website"> Learning and Skills Council</a> and to other appropriate government agencies in order that they can carry out checks on our funding arrangements and our performance.  This helps <b>learndirect</b> and <b>learndirect</b> providers to maintain their funding.  Where such information is supplied, it is provided in an aggregated manner so that whilst such authorities may be aware of the number, geographic location, ethnic origin and sex of persons using <b>learndirect,</b> you cannot be personally identified from this information.</p>

<p>Please note that if you do not access any of the courses you have enrolled on for over six months, <b>learndirect</b> and/or the <b>learndirect</b> learning provider may withdraw you from the course. You will be able to ask your <b>learndirect</b> provider to re-instate the course if you would like to start learning again.</p>

<p>If you have not registered as a learner or member but are simply making a general enquiry using the email facility or other <b>learndirect</b> contact details provided on the website, your personal information will be used for the purposes of responding to your enquiry. If we wish to use your information for other purposes, for example where you are responding to a particular promotion or marketing campaign, we will tell you so and obtain your consent where appropriate.</p>

<h3>9. How does learndirect protect your personal information?</h3>
<p>As a registered data controller, <b>learndirect</b> is required to take appropriate technical measures to protect your personal information including making a regular backup of the <b>learndirect</b> system and data. <b>learndirect</b> implements a number of sophisticated authentication services and security measures to ensure the safety of any personal information it collects.  Your account is password protected and all information is contained on a secure server which is accessible only by a limited number of employees who have authorised access rights to such information. If your password has been compromised in any way you should immediately notify <b>learndirect</b> and change your password. You can change your password at any time using the "change my password" option on the "my details" menu item on your learner home page.</p>

<p>Whilst <b>learndirect</b> uses reasonable endeavours to protect your security in the manner described above, <b>learndirect</b> considers that it is only appropriate to advise users that data transmission over the Internet cannot always be guaranteed as 100% secure, and therefore that you use the website at your own risk.</p>

<p>Please refer to the <a href="http://www.learndirect.co.uk/terms/" title="read our Terms and Conditions">Terms and Conditions</a> for the <b>learndirect</b> policy in relation to purging of emails and webspace and the circumstances in which <b>learndirect</b> may deactivate your account and delete all records, files and associated information.</p>

<p>When you make a payment online, personal data is collected by Netbanx Limited using industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you input. For further details relating to the security of this information, please refer to <a href="http://www.netinvest.co.uk/ncr/netbanx/information.html" title="visit the Netbanx website">Netbanx</a>. Netbanx will use the information provided by you to refund any monies due to you if you cancel your Enrolment in accordance with the <b>learndirect</b> <a href="http://www.learndirect.co.uk/terms/" title="read our Terms and Conditions">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

<h3>10. How long does learndirect keep your personal data ?</h3>
<p>Personal data will be retained only for so long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information was collected, as required by law or to enforce or defend legal claims. In some circumstances, we will retain information which you may have deleted, for example, messages sent by you to your tutor, as evidence of your support, achievement or completion of a learning experience. Such information will be retained for a reasonable time.</p>

<h3>11. Does learndirect use cookies?</h3>
<p>Cookies are small text files which are sent to your browser by a web server and stored on your personal computer's hard disk. The use of cookies has increased dramatically in recent years. <b>learndirect</b> uses cookies for several purposes listed below :<br>

</p><ul>
<li>to minimise the amount of times you have to type in data. This means, for example, that you will not have to log in for a second time if you want to check your e-mail; </li>
<li>to record the answers that you give to the online questionnaire on the Website about your funding support. This cookie collects the data you enter in your response to the questions asked and stores a record of the answer given by the <b>learndirect</b> system. The cookie expires on your computer after 30 minutes and the data is not kept by <b>learndirect</b> unless you choose to carry on and buy a course at the reduced price in which case it is passed on automatically to the <b>learndirect</b> provider. The cookie still expires after 30 minutes even if you have chosen not to buy a course through the Website;</li>
<li>to record responses to banner advertising and to track website usage. These cookies do not collect your personal information and they are used to target our advertising, to track the success of our advertising and to track visitor usage of the <b>learndirect</b> website. These cookies are not issued by <b>learndirect</b> and may require your browser to connect to sites that are not run by <b>learndirect</b> and</li>
<li>to track responses to regular customer surveys for <b>learndirect.</b> These cookies are used to make sure that you don't see the same customer survey more than once. These cookies are not issued by <b>learndirect.</b></li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>You can always disable cookies via your browser preferences. If you want to know how to do this please look at the 'help' menu on your browser. Most modern browsers have cookies turned on as a default. If you choose to disable cookies you may not be able to use certain <b>learndirect</b> features and you may be required to enter your password more frequently. Please remember that cookies cannot read your hard drive or make any information collected by use of a cookie available to any third party. A cookie can only be read by the website of the organisation that set it.</p>

<p><b>learndirect</b> uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These files are not issued by <b>learndirect</b> but by an advertising provider. These files enable <b>learndirect</b> advertising providers to recognise a unique cookie in your web browser, which in turn enables <b>learndirect</b> to learn which advertisements bring customers to our website. These files are anonymous and not personally identifiable.</p>

<h3>12. The learndirect policy for children</h3>

<p><b>learndirect</b> understands the importance of protecting children's privacy.  The Website is not intentionally designed for or directed at children under the age of 13.  However, <b>learndirect</b> believes that ultimately it is the responsibility of parents to supervise children when on-line and <b>learndirect</b> recommends that parental control tools be put in place.</p>

<p>No one under the age of 16 will be able to register on-line as a learner or member, and users are advised that government funding for courses is not available to persons under the age of 19.</p>

<p>Information collected from persons under the age of 18 will not be used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, as is stated when you register for competitions or promotions.</p>

<p>Although anyone will be able to participate in competitions and promotions, notification of a win or prize will be sent directly to the parent or guardian identified in the initial registration process. Any publication of a competition winner's personal details for visitors under 18 will require parental or guardian consent during registration.</p>

<h3>13. Internet-based Transfers</h3>
<p>Given the global nature of the Internet, use of the Internet to collect and process data necessarily involves personal data being transmitted on an international basis. By using the Website and communicating with learndirect electronically, you acknowledge and agree to the processing of your personal data in this way.</p>

<h3>14. Your Rights</h3>
<p>You have the right to ask for a copy of your information (for which we charge a small fee) and to correct any inaccuracies. You can amend your details on the Website at any time using the "my details" menu item on your learner home page. To obtain a copy of the information we hold about you please ring us on <b>08000 150 450</b> or <a href="mailto:enquiries@learndirect.net?Subject=Privacy Statement query">e-mail us</a>.</p>

<h3>15. Links</h3>
<p>The Website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that <b>learndirect</b> is not responsible for the privacy policies of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware of this when they leave the <b>learndirect</b> Website and to read the privacy statement of each and every website that collects personal information from them.</p>
