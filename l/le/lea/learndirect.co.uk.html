<p><strong>Your Rights and Choices</strong></p>
<p>You can request that:</p>
<ul>
<li>your details not be used for marketing purposes;</li>
<li>we provide you with a copy of the information we hold about you;</li>
<li>we correct inaccuracies in your information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) strengthens your rights over how companies use your data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We ensure Data Subjects rights under the GDPR are protected by ensuring a data subject can request:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table class="table">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The right to be informed<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></td>
<td>The right to be informed encompasses our obligation to provide ‘fair processing information’, typically through a privacy notice. It emphasises the need for transparency over how we use personal data of individuals.<p></p>
<p>The information we supply about the processing of personal data must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible;</li>
<li>written in clear and plain language, particularly if addressed to a child; and</li>
<li>free of charge.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The right of access<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Individuals have the right to access their personal data and supplementary information. This is known as a Subject Access Request (SAR).</li>
<li>The right of access allows individuals to be aware of and verify the lawfulness of the processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the GDPR, individuals will have the right to obtain:</p>
<ul>
<li>confirmation that their data is being processed;</li>
<li>access to their personal data; and</li>
<li>other supplementary information – this largely corresponds to the information that should be provided in a privacy notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>We must provide a copy of the information free of charge. However, we can charge a ‘reasonable fee’ when a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, particularly if it is repetitive.</p>
<p>Information must be provided without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt. We will be able to extend the period of compliance by a further two months where requests are complex or numerous.</p>
<p>Certain data may not be disclosed where a relevant exemption applies. We will provide an explanation and a right of appeal in these circumstances.</p>
<p>Where we are not the Data Controller, we will forward the request to the Data Controller and otherwise assist in answering the request, where appropriate. For example, where we are a Data Processor we will provide information we hold on behalf of the Data Controller to the Data Controller within a reasonable amount of time to allow them to respond to the request within the statutory time limits.</p>
<p>For more information about SAR process, please refer to <span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span> Subject Access Request process.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The right to rectification<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>The GDPR gives individuals the right to have personal data rectified.</li>
<li>Personal data can be rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
<li>We must respond within one month. This can be extended by two months where the request for rectification is complex.</li>
<li>If we cannot take any action in response to a request for rectification, we must explain why to the individual, informing them of their right to complain to the supervisory authority (ICO) and to a judicial remedy.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The right to erasure<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>The right to erasure is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’.</li>
<li>The broad principle behind this right is to enable an individual to request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals have a right to have personal data erased and to prevent processing in specific circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was originally collected/processed;</li>
<li>When the individual withdraws consent;</li>
<li>When the individual objects to the processing and there is no overriding legitimate interest for continuing the processing;</li>
<li>The personal data was unlawfully processed (i.e. otherwise in breach of the GDPR);</li>
<li>The personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can refuse to comply with a request for erasure where the personal data is processed for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;</li>
<li>to comply with a legal obligation for the performance of a public interest task or exercise of official authority;</li>
<li>for public health purposes in the public interest;</li>
<li>archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research historical research or statistical purposes; or</li>
<li>the exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The right to restrict&nbsp;processing<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Individuals have a right to ‘block’ or suppress processing of personal data.</li>
<li>When processing is restricted, we are permitted to store the personal data to comply with legal or contractual obligations, but not further process it.</li>
<li>We can retain just enough information about the individual to ensure that the restriction is respected in future.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be required to restrict the processing of personal data in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where an individual contests the accuracy of the personal data, we should restrict the processing until we have verified the accuracy of the personal data;</li>
<li>Where an individual has objected to the processing (where it was necessary for the performance of a public interest task or purpose of legitimate interests), and we are considering whether our organisation’s legitimate grounds override those of the individual;</li>
<li>When processing is unlawful and the individual opposes erasure and requests restriction instead;</li>
<li>If we no longer need the personal data but the individual requires the data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim;</li>
</ul>
<p>We must inform individuals when we decide to lift a restriction on processing.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The right to data portability<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></td>
<td>The right to data portability allows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services.<p></p>
<p>It allows them to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment to another in a safe and secure way, without hindrance to usability.</p>
<p>The right to data portability only applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>to personal data an individual has provided to a controller;</li>
<li>where the processing is based on the individual’s consent or for the performance of a contract; and</li>
<li>when processing is carried out by automated means;</li>
</ul>
<p>We must provide the personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable form. Open formats include CSV files. Machine readable means that the information is structured so that software can extract specific elements of the data. This enables other organisations to use the data.</p>
<p>We must respond without undue delay, and within one month. This can be extended by two months where the request is complex or we receive a number of requests. We must inform the individual within one month of the receipt of the request and explain why the extension is necessary.</p>
<p>The information must be provided free of charge.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The right to object<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></td>
<td>If a data subject believes that the processing of personal information about them is causing, or is likely to cause, substantial and unwarranted damage or distress to them or another person, they may notify the organisation in writing to request <span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span> to put a stop to the processing of that information.<p></p>
<p>Individuals have the right to object to:</p>
<ul>
<li>processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling);</li>
<li>direct marketing (including profiling); and</li>
<li>processing for purposes of scientific/ historical research and statistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>We must stop processing the personal data unless:</p>
<ul>
<li>we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the individual; or</li>
<li>the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
</ul>
<p>We must inform individuals of their right to object “at the point of first communication” and in our privacy notice. This must be “explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and shall be presented clearly and separately from any other information”.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling</td>
<td>The GDPR applies to all automated individual decision-making and profiling. This may be not applicable to <span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span> if we are not using any automated means to process personal data.<p></p>
<p>Automated individual decision-making (making a decision solely by automated means without any human involvement)</p>
<p>Profiling (automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain things about an individual). Profiling can be part of an automated decision-making process.</p>
<p>We can only carry out this type of decision-making where the decision is:</p>
<ul>
<li>necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract; or</li>
<li>authorised by Union or Member state law applicable to the controller; or</li>
<li>based on the individual’s explicit consent.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Giving information for other people</strong></p>
<p>When you give us information about another person, the other person must have agreed to let :</p>
<ul>
<li>us process all their personal data; and</li>
<li>you receive any data protection notices for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you send information for someone else, you are confirming that you have told them :</p>
<ul>
<li>which data they must give;</li>
<li>which information is voluntary; and</li>
<li>how they can access and, if necessary, correct the data we hold about them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The information we collect during the enrolment process</strong><br>
<strong>&nbsp;in a&nbsp;</strong><span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span><strong>&nbsp;centre</strong></p>
<p>When you enrol with us, you (or the person enrolling you) must tell us:</p>
<ul>
<li>your full name;</li>
<li>your gender</li>
<li>your date of birth;</li>
<li>your address (and correspondence address if different);</li>
<li>primary telephone number;</li>
<li>your employment status;</li>
<li>where you heard about us;</li>
<li>if you have done any learning in the last three years.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also request other information including your title, middle name, email address, National Insurance number and if you are a Welsh speaker, but you don’t have to give us these details. Following enrolment via the website, we, or our approved service providers, may request additional personal data from you in order to further support your learning. You do not have to provide this information, but if you do not, you may not get the most out of your learning. However, we ask you to tell us whether you have achieved Level 2 in English and Maths.</p>
<p>Before you enrol, we will give you a username and ask you for a password. You will also be given a learner reference number and asked to give the answer to a question you choose which will identify you.</p>
<p><em><strong>online</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Before enrolment</em></p>
<ul>
<li>your full name;</li>
<li>your date of birth;</li>
<li>your address (and correspondence address if different);</li>
<li>primary telephone number;</li>
<li>your employment status;</li>
<li>email address;</li>
<li>your education so far;</li>
<li>your citizenship status; and</li>
<li>where you live and how long you have lived there.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use this information to check whether you are eligible for funding. If you are not eligible this information will be destroyed.</p>
<p><em>At enrolment</em></p>
<p>We will call you at the time of your choice to check all the above details with you and may request additional information, such as where you heard about us and if you have done any learning in the last three years, other information we may collect is set out in this Privacy Statement. You will need a user name and password to access your course materials. Your user name is your email address and you can either choose your own password or we will give you one which you must change when you first log in. If you are already registered on the&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;community you will use the same user name and password to access your learning.</p>
<p>Please note that when you enrol on a&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;course that leads to a qualification such as an NVQ, we send non sensitive personal information to the relevant awarding bodies so that they can undertake the administration associated with your qualification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other information we collect, if you enrol in a learning centre, to see if you can have government funding</strong></p>
<p>If government funding is available for any of our courses, you need to answer some other questions to see if you are eligible for funding. If you wish to take advantage of any such funding, you will be asked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>your age;</li>
<li>your education so far;</li>
<li>your citizenship status; and</li>
<li>where you live and how long you have lived there.</li>
</ul>
<p>We, or our approved service providers, may require additional information from you in order to support an application for funding. If you do not want to provide us with this information, we will not be able to offer you the course at the reduced price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learner File</strong></p>
<p>When you start your learning we or your Service Provider will create a Learner File to hold the documents which relate to your learning and evidence of proof of identity and funding eligibility. As you progress through your learning other documents, including some of your course work, may be held on this file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The information we collect when you access course materials</strong></p>
<p>We collect information about how you use course materials to monitor your learning and improve our users’ learning experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The information we collect when you enter competitions</strong></p>
<p>From time to time we may run competitions and promotions on the website. If you enter these, we may ask for your name, address, email address and username so that we can administer and control the competition and, of course, notify the winners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other information we collect</strong></p>
<p>If you require a free information pack, we ask you to provide us with the information on the “request more information” form on the website, including:</p>

<li>Whether you would like to know where your nearest&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>centres are;</li>
<li>Where you heard about us.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also decide to give us your home and mobile telephone numbers and your email address but you only need to do this if you want us and/or our approved service providers to contact you about&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>developments and offers in this way.</p>
<p>If you are not registered as a&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;learner but use one of our online tests to test your skills, we ask you to provide your full name and email address. This information is not retained by us but is used only when sending you your test results.</p>
<p>You may also provide personal data through:</p>
<ul>
<li>calls to our helplines;</li>
<li>letters and email;</li>
<li>customer feedback forms;</li>
<li>the&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>“Community”; or</li>
<li>other learning or communications facility offered by us.</li>
</ul>
<p>* We may record calls to helplines and communications via on-line tools for quality and training purposes only. We will store calls for about six months and we will keep them confidential. In general, if you contact us, we may keep a record of your query or complaint for a reasonable time in case you contact us again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sensitive personal data</strong></p>
<p>Sensitive personal data includes details of your:</p>
<ul>
<li>race or ethnic origin</li>
<li>political opinions</li>
<li>religious or other beliefs</li>
<li>trade-union membership</li>

</ul>
<p>At or before enrolment you may be asked for sensitive personal information but you do not have to provide it. If you decide to provide sensitive personal data we will use it for the purposes described in the section below.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you do not want to provide it, or do not want us to use it for these purposes then when enrolling online please select the “prefer not to say” option or if enrolling in a&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;centre select the “Not Known/Not Provided” option.</p>
<p>You may also volunteer sensitive personal data to us or our approved service providers, for example, when you submit a query or comment to us via the website or some other means of communication. If you do so, you explicitly consent to our using such information as described in this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How we use the information we collect</strong></p>
<p>We use your personal information and your Learner File:</p>
<ul>
<li>to answer your queries or complaints;</li>
<li>to deliver our services, for example on-line tools to test your skills;</li>
<li>to provide the&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>“Community” facility;</li>
<li>to support your learning;</li>
<li>to provide course materials;</li>
<li>to carry out administration;</li>
<li>to improve the quality of services;</li>
<li>to support your application for government funding;</li>

<li>for general statistics and research;</li>
<li>for obtaining any relevant professional advice;</li>
<li>as may be required by law or in connection with legal proceedings (including where we intend to take legal proceedings), or as may be necessary to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Third parties and sponsors</strong></p>
<p>To achieve the purposes set out in this privacy statement we may need to share your information and Learner File with our service providers (including our approved learning providers), agents, professional advisors and auditors and to your tutor(s). When you enrol on a course with a service provider in a&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;centre, the service provider will be delivering and supporting your learning. Following enrolment via a centre or online, all of our approved service providers will have access to your name, date of birth, address, username, learner reference number and which&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;courses you have enrolled on in the past as well as details relating to these&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;courses to help us deliver our services to you. &nbsp;In a limited number of circumstances it may be necessary to allow a new Service Provider access to all your personal information for example if your existing Service Provider no longer provides&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>We may also give your information to third parties who may take over part or all of the&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;business in the future, but only for the purposes outlined in this privacy statement. If your employer, trade organisation or other organisation is sponsoring or supporting you, we may give the personal information we have collected to your sponsor to monitor your learning.</p>
<p>Communications between you and your tutor using any of the tools or functions we make available to you (including unopened messages sent via our messaging system) may be monitored by&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;staff to check the quality of tutor support.&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;staff and auditors may also access these communications when we want to investigate or audit learner funding arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>Referral Partners</strong></p>
<p>If we have received your details as a referral from one of our partners we may be required by the referral partner to provide them with updates on the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attendance</li>
<li>Progress</li>
<li>Achievement/completion</li>
<li>Outcome/destination</li>
<li>Withdrawal</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Job Centre Plus Referrals</strong></p>
<p>If we or our Service Providers receive your details via a Skills Conditionality Referral from Job Centre Plus we are obliged to keep them informed of your progress.&nbsp; We will complete a Starter/Leaver notification form that contains details of the course being taken, when started and an anticipated end date.&nbsp; You will be asked to sign this to confirm you have started the learning prior to it being sent to Job Centre Plus for processing.&nbsp; When you stop learning for whatever reason the remaining boxes of the Starter/Leaver notification form are completed and returned to Job Centre Plus.&nbsp; In certain circumstances this may result in sanctions being applied by Job Centre Plus, details of these are available from www.direct.gov.uk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Keeping you informed</strong></p>
<p>We, and our approved service providers, will use your information to send you regular updates about:</p>
<ul>
<li>our services and materials;</li>
<li>additions to the website; and</li>
<li>specific activities such as customer feedback surveys and competitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you enrol on a&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;course you will periodically be sent customer feedback surveys.&nbsp; If you do not wish to be contacted for marketing purposes untick the relevant boxes on the ’contact permissions’ page. If at any time, you change your mind about receiving updates, you can change your preferences using “edit your details” on your learner home page.</p>
<p>If you are simply requesting a free information pack, you can invite us to send you updates by ticking the appropriate boxes on the “request more information” page. If you change your mind about us contacting you for this purpose, please ring us on 0800&nbsp;101&nbsp;901 or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:enquiries@learndirect.net?Subject=Privacy%20Statement%20query">email us</a>.</p>
<p>We will never use your sensitive personal data for marketing purposes without your express consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong></p>
<p>We, and our approved service providers, may use your personal data to process or to support any application made for funding associated with your learning. For these purposes we, or our approved service providers, will share the information you supply with the Skills Funding Agency in England. The Skills Funding Agency may in turn share it with the European Social Fund, or other government agencies that may provide funding for your course, including the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wales.gov.uk/">Welsh Assembly Government</a>&nbsp;for learners who enrol in Welsh centres. We may use a third party service to verify your identity for funding eligibility.&nbsp;If you are a learner between the ages of 16-19 years of age (or up to 25 years of age for learners with learning difficulties or disabilities), we are required by the Skills Funding Agency to notify Connexions when you leave, or intend to leave learning. We, or our approved service providers, may also share it with the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) so that it can check our use of public monies. If you do not want us to use your personal data for these purposes, we will not be able to offer you the course at the reduced price.</p>
<p>At the point this information is collected you will be asked to indicate if you do not wish to be contacted by the Skills Funding Agency or its partners in respect of courses, surveys and research. You can change your choices at any time by talking to your tutor.&nbsp; Please read the SFA Privacy Notice below.</p>
<p>We, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may use your personal data and Learner File to investigate a suspected misuse of public monies or other fraudulent activity by any person relating to your learning activity. In doing so, we, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may disclose your information to other government agencies (e.g. the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/">Department for Work and Pensions</a>) to establish whether there has been any duplication of funding for your course. We may also contact you for the purposes of any such investigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ESFA Privacy Notice 2017 to 2018</strong></p>
<p>This privacy notice is issued by the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA), on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Department of Education (DfE). It is to inform learners how their personal information will be used by the DfE, the ESFA (an executive agency of the DfE) and any successor bodies to these organisations. For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, the DfE is the data controller for personal data processed by the ESFA..</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Your Personal Information</strong><br>
Your personal information is used by the DfE to exercise its functions and to meet its statutory responsibilities, including under the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 and to create and maintain a unique learner number (ULN) and a personal learning record (PLR).</p>
<p>Your information may be shared with third parties for education, training, employment and well-being related purposes, including for research. This will only take place where the law allows it and the sharing is in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
<p>The English European Social Fund (ESF) Managing Authority (or agents acting on its behalf) may contact you in order for them to carry out research and evaluation to inform the effectiveness of training.</p>
<p>You can opt out from being contacted for other purposes by choosing a relevant option in the ESFA Contact Restriction fields which will be discussed with you when you register with&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>.</p>
<p>Further information about use of and access to your personal data, and details of organisations with whom we regularly share data are available at:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esfa-privacy-notice">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esfa-privacy-notice</a></p>
<p><strong>Statistics</strong></p>
<p>We and/or the approved service providers delivering and supporting your learning are also required to provide statistics to all of the government agencies mentioned under the heading ‘Funding’ and to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/">Department for Business, Innovation and Skills</a>, in order that they can carry out checks on our funding arrangements and our performance and for research and statistical purposes. This helps us, and our approved service providers, to maintain our funding. Where such information is supplied, it is provided in an aggregated manner so that whilst such authorities may be aware of, for example, the number, geographic location and sex of persons using&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>, you cannot be personally identified from this information.</p>
<p>However, we may provide information that identifies you (your name, date of birth, address and postcode) to the Department of Work and Pensions so that they can check whether&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;learners have progressed into employment and compile statistical information about such progression. You will not be identifiable from the statistical information compiled.</p>
<p>The information collected on Welsh speakers is passed in an aggregate manner to the Welsh Assembly. You cannot be personally identified from this information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Requests for information</strong></p>
<p>If you have not registered as a learner but are simply making an enquiry or request for information, we will use your personal information to reply to your enquiry or request. We will not use this information for marketing purposes without your permission or unless you invite us to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Protecting your personal information</strong></p>
<p>We are registered as a data controller (in our registered company name of&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;Limited) in line with the UK Data Protection Act, 1998. As a registered data controller, we are required to take appropriate technical measures to protect your personal information including making a regular backup of our system and data. We have security measures in place to make sure any personal information we collect is secure. Your account is password protected and all information including your password is on a secure server, which only a limited number of employees and sub-contractors can access. All parties with access to your information are subject to confidentiality obligations. If you think someone else knows your password, or is using it, tell us immediately and change your password using the “change my password” option under “your details” on your learner home page.</p>
<p>Even though we take appropriate technical steps to protect your security, you should remember that data transmission over the internet cannot always be guaranteed as 100% secure so you use the website at your own risk.</p>
<p>Please look at the terms and conditions on this website for our policy on purging emails and webspace. The terms and conditions tell you when we may close your account and delete all your records, files and information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Keeping your personal data</strong></p>
<p>We keep personal data and Learner Files:</p>
<ul>
<li>for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for;</li>
<li>as required by law; or</li>
<li>to enforce or defend legal claims.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes we will keep information that you have deleted, for example messages sent by you to your tutor, as a record of your learning experience. We will keep this information for a reasonable time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our policy for children</strong></p>
<p>Our website is not designed for or directed at children under the age of 13. No one whose date of birth indicates that they are under 16 years will be able to register on-line as a learner. We recommend that you put parental controls on your internet browser and supervise your children when they are online.</p>
<p>We will not use information collected from people under 18 for marketing purposes. In general, Government funding is not available to learners under 19 via&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>, although there are some specific exceptions, in particular apprenticeships.&nbsp; This privacy statement will apply to any learner enrolled on an apprenticeship even if you are aged between 16 and 18.</p>
<p>Although anyone can take part in competitions and promotions, we will send notice of a win or prize directly to the parent or guardian identified during registration. Where a winner is under 18, we will not publish his or her personal details unless we have obtained the consent of the parent or guardian during registration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you are a tutor</strong></p>
<p>When you are registered as a tutor by a Service Provider you accept that all activity is undertaken by you for the provision of&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;learning.&nbsp; Any comments or tutor notes placed by you on the&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;system will be retained, are visible to the relevant learner and authorised personnel within&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;Ltd and may be used as evidence of learner support.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment</strong>:</p>
<p>Assessment is an important part of your course. It is the only way to get the qualification that you want when you have finished your learning. It may be the online test for maths and English, or a portfolio if you are doing a vocational qualification.</p>
<p>If you are doing an English or maths course, your service provider will help prepare you for your Skills for Life test, and will arrange with you a suitable time and date to take your test. There is no charge for this service.</p>
<p>If you are doing an NVQ, your&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;assessor will help you prepare and submit your portfolio. Once you have been assessed and passed, you will get your certificate for your qualification.</p>
<p>There is no extra charge for assessment and certification.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Provision of Access</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) If you have purchased online via the&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;website</p>
<p>We will provide you with access to online Course Materials after we have confirmed your order by email. This will immediately follow a successful online transaction.</p>
<p>The online purchase process prompts you to specify whether you are:<br>
a) buying for yourself or<br>
b) buying for others.</p>
<p>Where you have specified that you are buying for yourself, in order to access Course Materials, you will be able to access the Course Materials by logging on the website using your registration details. The Course Materials can be accessed by you through the “my courses” page of the Website.</p>
<p>Where you have specified that you are buying for your business, or if you have purchased multiple copies of the same Course, the website will generate a series of “Enrolment Keys”. An Enrolment Key is a string of numbers and letters which will allow an individual to access the relevant Course Materials through the website after registration. Each Enrolment Key can be used by one person to access a specific Course. You may supply Enrolment Keys that we provide to you to individuals within your organisation (“Enrolment Key Holders”) for the purpose of providing them with access to the Course Materials. Unless otherwise stated, enrolment keys must be activated within 6 months and will provide access to the course for the duration stated on the course description. We cannot extend or replace expired enrolment keys.</p>
<p><strong>(b) If you have purchased by placing an order to be paid by invoice</strong></p>
<p>We will provide you with access to online Course Materials after we have confirmed your order by email. This will immediately follow a successful online transaction. Depending on your purchase and delivery requirements, we will fulfil your order in one of a number of ways.</p>
<p>These may include:<br>
“Enrolment Keys”. An Enrolment Key is a string of numbers and letters which will allow an individual to access the relevant Course Materials through the Website after registration. Each Enrolment Key can be used by one person to access a specific Course. You may supply Enrolment Keys that we provide to you to individuals within your organisation (“Enrolment Key Holders”) for the purpose of providing them with access to the Course Materials. Unless otherwise stated, enrolment keys must be activated within 6 months and will provide access to the course for the duration stated on the course description (typically 3 or 6 months). We cannot extend or replace expired Enrolment Keys.</p>
<p>“Learner Management System” (LMS).” A LMS is an online system that can be used to facilitate and track course enrolments. Depending on your purchase, the access model may include:</p>
<p>“Specific Course Enrolments” If you have purchased a number of enrolments (an enrolment provides access to a single course for one individual learner) from a specific course range, these will be added to your LMS account for you to administer (by registering your learners and providing access to the courses). In this case the enrolments must be accessed by the individuals within 12 months and (once the enrolment has been activated) will provide access to the course for the duration stated on the course description (typically 3 or 6 months). We cannot extend or replace expired enrolments.</p>
<p>“Pre-payment”. If you require the flexibility to select courses from across the range of products on the LMS, then you may make a pre-payment for unspecified course enrolments which will be added as a “starting balance” onto the LMS. The cost of each individual course (as shown on the LMS) is deducted from the pre-paid balance when a learner is enrolled onto that course. Your pre-payment must be used within 12 months and cannot be extended or refunded (meaning that you must “spend” your pre-payment by enrolling learners within the system to the value of the pre-payment).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>c) If you purchased online Course Materials from one of our Resellers, you will be given access to the materials by the Reseller.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that it is your responsibility to check that the computer you plan to use to access your Course Materials is compatible with the minimum specification requirement that relates to the Materials you are ordering. The minimum specification for each course is provided on the Website.<br>
You accept that you will not have a claim for breach of contract (either against&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;or an Agent or Reseller of&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>) or otherwise in respect of any period of downtime/ unavailability of the website in circumstances similar to those outlined in Part A paragraph 1 of these Terms (dealing with the accessibility of the Website</p>
<p><strong>Delivery of offline products (CD Roms, DVD etc)</strong></p>

<p>These periods are called “cooling-off periods” and we will credit the Course Fee to your credit or debit card as appropriate within 28 days of receiving your notice of cancellation.</p>
<p>During the cooling-off period, you may cancel your order by post, telephone, email or fax using the contact details at the end of Paragraph 1.</p>
<p><strong>(a) If you have purchased online from one of our Authorised Resellers</strong></p>
<p>You may cancel your purchase of Course Materials within the following periods:</p>
<p><strong>Online Course Materials:</strong>&nbsp;You may cancel your purchase of Course Materials within a period of 7 working days beginning on the day after the day on which the contract is concluded between you and the Reseller.</p>
<p><strong>Course Materials in CD-ROM or other offline format:</strong>&nbsp;You may cancel your purchase of Offline Course Materials within a period of 7 working days beginning with the day after the day on which you receive the CD-ROM or other offline materials.</p>
<p>These periods are called “cooling-off periods” and during this period you should contact the Reseller who will arrange a refund.</p>
<p><em>Exceptions to the right to cancel during the cooling-off period.</em></p>
<p>You cannot cancel your purchase of Course Materials if you have accessed the Course Materials (as the contract will be deemed to have commenced at the time of access), unless the Course Materials are faulty.</p>
<p>Offline Course Materials must be returned to us in their original condition with the security seals intact. You cannot cancel your purchase of Offline Course Materials comprised of CDs, DVD or tapes with audio or video recordings or computer software if the security seal has been broken, unless such items are faulty.</p>
<p>Your statutory rights in the event of receiving faulty goods are not affected. However, we reserve the right to independently test any returned item. Where the result of such tests proves that the item is not faulty, we will return the item to you and charge you the direct cost of re-delivering such item. For this reason, where possible, we advise you to check the Offline Course Materials on a second machine or alternative equipment before returning them to us. Conversely, where the result of such tests proves that the item is faulty, you will not be charged for the cost of sending any replacement product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Quality of the services</strong></p>
<p>We will provide the Course Materials in accordance with the Course description which is set out on the Website.</p>
<p>We do not make any commitment to you that the Course will meet any specific requirements that you have and we expect you to take reasonable care to verify that the Course in question will meet your needs. We do not make any commitment to you that you will obtain any particular result from your use of the Course Materials or that you will obtain any particular qualification on completion of the Course (unless otherwise stated on the Website).</p>
<p>Other than the stated minimum technical specification, we do not make any commitment that the Course Materials will be compatible with or operate with your software or hardware.</p>
<p>All representations, warranties and/or terms and/or commitments not expressly set out in these Terms (whether implied by law, conduct, statute or otherwise) are hereby excluded to the maximum extent permissible at law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our Rights to Stop Providing the Services to you</strong></p>
<p>If you have purchased online Course Materials via the&nbsp;<span class="learndirect-highlight">learndirect</span>&nbsp;website, we will make the Course Materials available to you for a period of six months after which point we will suspend your access to the course. This six month period starts immediately following the issue of your confirmation email. If you purchased the materials from one of our Resellers the six month period is from the date the Reseller gives you access to the materials. If you wish to access the Course Materials after your access has been terminated, you will need to submit a new order via the Website or contact the Reseller from whom you purchased the Materials. In certain circumstances, for example if you suffer from a disability, we may extend the time period in which you may access the Course Materials. To enquire about such an extension, please contact us via contact details above.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to suspend your access to online Course Materials immediately in the event that:</p>
<ul>
<li>you fail to comply with the clause of these Terms which deals with the manner in which you are permitted to use the Course Materials and the Website; or</li>
<li>you fail to conduct yourself in an appropriate manner when communicating with or receiving support from us. By this we mean that you act in such a way as to threaten, intimidate or otherwise harass our staff.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we exercise this right we will notify you and will then immediately suspend your access to the Course Materials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our Liability to you</strong></p>
<p>Notwithstanding these terms;</p>
<p>The exclusions and limitations of liability contained in these Terms do not apply to:</p>
<ul>
<li>[your statutory rights as a consumer, nor your right to return the Course Materials;]</li>
<li>any other losses which may not be excluded or limited by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>We make every effort to perform our obligations under our contract with you. However, we cannot be held responsible for delays or failure to perform if such delay or failure is caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control. In the event of a delay, we will perform our obligations as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
<p>We are not responsible to you for any data that you lose either (a) as a result of accessing the Course Materials; or (b) during completion of any Course via the Website. It is your responsibility to ensure that you regularly save and back up (i) all data which you hold on the computer from which you are accessing the Course Materials, and (ii) all data that you are inputting when completing the Course.</p>
<p>In the event that we recommend that you either enable cookies or download certain publicly accessible software to ensure that your computer is capable of accessing the Course Materials, you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>Except as set out in these Terms, our maximum aggregate liability to you for any claim that you may have against us, under or in connection with, the provision by us, to you, of the Course Materials and associated technical support which is not otherwise excluded in these Terms (including without limitation where such claim arises as a direct result of any negligent technical advice provided by us) shall be limited to the amount of the Course Fee which has been paid, or is payable, by you or on your behalf.</p>
<p>Each provision of this paragraph shall be construed separately as between you and us. If any part is held by a court to be unreasonable, inapplicable or unenforceable, then the other parts shall still apply.</p>
