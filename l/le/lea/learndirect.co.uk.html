    provide this information, but if you do not, you may not get the most out
    of your learning. However, we ask you to tell us whether you have achieved
    Level 2 in English and Maths.
</p>
<p>
    Before you enrol, we will give you a username and ask you for a password.

    choose your own password or we will give you one which you must change when
    you first log in. If you are already registered on the
    <strong>learndirect</strong> community you will use the&nbsp;same user name
    and password to access your learning.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Please note that when you enrol on a <strong>learndirect</strong> course
    that leads to a qualification such as an NVQ, we send non-sensitive
    personal information to the relevant awarding bodies so that they can

        centre,&nbsp;to see if you can have government funding

</p>
<ul>

<h3>
    <a id="9" name="9"></a>Third parties and sponsors
</h3>
<p>
    To achieve the purposes set out in this privacy statement we may need to
    share your information and Learner File with our service providers
    (including our approved learning providers), agents, professional advisors
    and auditors and to your tutor(s). When you enrol on a course in a
    <strong>learndirect</strong> centre, we will tell you which of our approved
    learning providers will be delivering and supporting your learning.
    Following enrolment via a centre or online, all of our approved learning
    providers will have access to your name, date of birth, address, username,
    learner reference number and which <strong>learndirect</strong> courses you
    have enrolled on in the past as well as details relating to these
    <strong>learndirect</strong> courses to help us deliver our services to
    you.
</p>
<p>
    We may also give your information to third parties who may take over part
    or all of the <strong>learndirect</strong> business in the future, but only
    for the purposes outlined in this privacy statement. If your employer,
    trade organisation or other organisation is sponsoring or supporting you,
    we may give the personal information we have collected to your sponsor to
    monitor your learning.
</p>
<p>
    Communications between you and your tutor using any of the tools or
    functions we make available to you (including unopened messages sent via
    our messaging system) may be monitored by <strong>learndirect</strong>
    staff to check the quality of tutor support. <strong>learndirect</strong>
    staff and auditors may also access these communications when we want to
    investigate or audit learner funding arrangements.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="10" name="10"></a>Keeping you informed
</h3>
<p>
    We, and our approved learning providers, will use your information to send
    you regular updates about :
</p>
<ul>
    <li>our services and materials;
    </li>
    <li>additions to the website; and
    </li>
    <li>specific activities such as customer feedback surveys and competitions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you enrol on a <strong>learndirect</strong> course you will periodically
    be sent customer feedback surveys. If you&nbsp;do not wish to&nbsp;be
    contacted for marketing&nbsp;purposes untick the relevant boxes on the
    'contact permissions' page. If at any time, you change your mind about
    receiving updates, you can change your preferences using 'edit your
    details' on your learner home page.
</p>
<p>
    If you are simply requesting a free information pack, you can invite us to
    send you updates by ticking the appropriate boxes on the "request more
    information" page. If you change your mind about us contacting you for this
    purpose, please ring us on <strong>0800&nbsp;101&nbsp;901</strong> or
    <a href="mailto:enquiries@learndirect.net?Subject=Privacy%20Statement%20query">
    email us</a>.
</p>
<p>
    We will never use your sensitive personal data for marketing
    purposes&nbsp;without your express consent.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="11" name="11"></a>Funding
</h3>
<p>
    We, and our approved learning providers, may use your personal data to
    process or to support any application made for funding associated with your
    learning. For these purposes we, or our approved learning providers, will
    share the information you supply with the
    <a href="http://www.lsc.gov.uk/">Learning and Skills Council (LSC)</a> in
    England. The LSC may in turn share it with the European Social Fund, or
    other government agencies that may provide funding for your course,
    including the <a href="http://www.wales.gov.uk/">Welsh Assembly
    Government</a>&nbsp;for learners who enrol in Welsh centres. We may use a
    third party service to verify your identity for funding
    eligibility.&nbsp;If you are a learner between the ages of 16-19 years of
    age (or up to 25 years of age for learners with learning difficulties or
    disabilities), we are required by the Skills Funding Agency to notify
    Connexions when you leave, or intend to leave learning. We, or our approved
    learning providers, may also share it with the Office for Standards in
    Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) so that it can check our
    use of public monies. If you do not want us to use your personal data for
    these purposes, we will not be able to offer you the course at the reduced
    price.
</p>
<p>
    At the point this information is collected you will be asked to indicate if
    you do not wish to be contacted by the LSC or its partners in respect of
    courses, surveys and research. Please read the&nbsp;SFA Data Protection
    Statement.
</p>
<p>
    We, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may use
    your personal data and Learner File to investigate a suspected misuse of
    public monies or other fraudulent activity by any person relating to your
    learning activity. In doing so, we, or the government agency providing
    funding for your course, may disclose your information to other government
    agencies (e.g. the <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/">Department for Work and
    Pensions</a>) to establish whether there has been any duplication of
    funding for your course. We may also contact you for the purposes of any
    such investigation.

<h3>
    Learner Registration Service (LRS) and the Unique Learner Number (ULN)
    Statement
</h3>
<p>
    The Learner Registration Service (LRS) is operated by the SFA for learners
    aged 14 years and over and learners registering for relevant post-14
    qualifications. LRS is responsible for the operation of the Learner
    Registration Service and also the creation of a Learner Record.
</p>
<p>
    By enrolling with Ufi, you agree to us providing LRS with your personal
    data so that LRS can allocate you a Unique Learner Number (ULN).
</p>
<p>
    The LRS will enable organisations listed in section 537A of the Education
    Act (<a href="http://www.miap.gov.uk/">www.miap.gov.uk</a>) to access your
    ULN and verify the details used to create your ULN, thereby saving you
    having to supply the same information repeatedly to different
    organisations.
</p>
<h3>
    Learner Record
</h3>
<p>
    By enrolling with Ufi, you also agree to us providing your participation
    and achievement data to LRS so that LRS can create and maintain a Learner
    Record. Your ULN will enable you to access the Ufi participation and
    achievement data held in your Learner Record via a website and will allow
    LRS to share this data with those organisations listed in section 537A of
    the Education Act (<a href="http://www.miap.gov.uk/">www.miap.gov.uk</a>.)
    You can decide to opt out of LRS sharing your participation and achievement
    data at any time and current details of how to do so can be found at
    www.miap.gov.uk or by telephoning 0845 6022589. LRS may use and disclose
    anonymised information pulled from Learner Records for statistical
    purposes. Ufi is not responsible for LRS’s privacy practices and you should
    read about such practices at
    <a href="http://www.miap.gov.uk/">www.miap.gov.uk</a>.

<h3>
    SFA Data Protection Statement
</h3>
<p>
    The SFA requires that we also tell you about its own Privacy Statement so
    that you understand how the SFA will use the information that we give it.
    It says:
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>“How we use your Personal Information</em></strong><br>
    The personal information you provide is passed to the Chief Executive of
    Skills Funding and, where required, the Young People's Learning Agency for
    England ("the YPLA") to enable those organisations to fulfil their
    statutory obligations, principally under the Apprenticeships, Skills,
    Children and Learning Act 2009. Both organisations are registered as data
    controllers with the UK Information Commissioner's Office.
</p>
<p>
    The Skills Funding Agency funds adult further education and skills
    training, including apprenticeships, in England. The YPLA is responsible
    for arranging the provision of funding for the education and training of
    young people in England. The Skills Funding Agency processes learner data
    on behalf of the YPLA.
</p>
<p>
    The information you provide may be shared with other organisations for
    purposes of administration, the provision of career and other guidance and
    statistical and research purposes, relating to education or training. Other
    organisations include the Department for Education, the Department for
    Business, Innovation and Skills, Local Authorities, Connexions, Higher
    Education Statistics Agency, Higher Education Funding Council for England,
    educational institutions and organisations performing research and
    statistical work on behalf of the Skills Funding Agency, the YPLA, or
    partners of those organisations.
</p>
<p>
    The Skills Funding Agency also administers the learner registration service
    (LRS) which uses your learner information to create and maintain a unique
    learner number (ULN).
</p>
<p>
    Further information about use of and access to your information is
    available at:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://skillsfundingagency.bis.gov.uk/foi.htm">Skills Funding
        Agency</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.ypla.gov.uk/foi.htm">YPLA</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    At no time will your personal information be passed to organisations for
    marketing or sales purposes. The YPLA, the Chief Executive of Skills
    Funding and their partners may wish to contact you from time to time in
    respect of surveys and research to monitor performance, improve quality and
    plan future provision and to inform you about courses, or learning
    opportunities relevant to you."
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="12" name="12"></a>Statistics
</h3>
<p>
    We and/or the approved learning providers delivering and supporting your
    learning are also required to provide statistics to all of the government
    agencies mentioned under the heading 'Funding' and to the
    <a href="http://www.dius.gov.uk/">Department for Innovation, Universities
    and Skills</a>, in order that they can carry out checks on our funding
    arrangements and our performance and for research and statistical purposes.
    This helps us, and our approved learning providers, to maintain our
    funding. Where such information is supplied, it is provided in an
    aggregated manner so that whilst such authorities may be aware of, for
    example, the number, geographic location and sex of persons using
    <strong>learndirect,</strong> you cannot be personally identified from this
    information.<br>
    However, we may provide information that identifies you (your name, date of
    birth, address and postcode) to the Department of Work and Pensions so that
    they can check whether <strong>learndirect</strong> learners have
    progressed into employment and compile statistical information about such
    progression. You will not be identifiable from the statistical information
    compiled.
</p>
<p>
    The information collected on Welsh speakers is passed in an aggregate
    manner to the Welsh Assembly. You cannot be personally identified from this
    information.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="13" name="13"></a>Requests for information
</h3>
<p>
    If you have not registered as a learner but are simply making an enquiry or
    request for information, we will use your personal information to reply to
    your enquiry or request. We will not use this information for marketing
    purposes without your permission or unless you invite us to do so.
</p>
<h3>
