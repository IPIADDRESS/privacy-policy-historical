<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p class="first">By using this website you accept the terms of this privacy statement, the <a href="/copyright/">copyright</a> 
statement and the <a href="/terms/">terms and conditions</a> on this website.</p>

<h3>Our commitment to privacy</h3>
<p>This privacy statement explains how we (<b>learndirect</b>) collect information from you via the website or in any manner expressly described in the privacy statement and how this information is then used.  When you provide us with your personal data in the manner described, you consent to the processing of all such personal data as set out in the privacy statement.
Please read this privacy statement carefully and revisit this page from time to time to review any changes that we may have made. If you have any questions or comments about how we handle your personal information, please ring us on <b>08000 150 450</b> or <a href="mailto:enquiries@learndirect.net?Subject=Privacy Statement query">e-mail us</a>. You may also use these contacts to tell us about any concerns you may have about our privacy statement.
We have registered as a data controller (in our registered company name of Ufi Limited) in line with the United Kingdom Data Protection Act, 1998.</p>

<h3>Giving information for other people</h3>
<p>When you give us information about another person, the other person must have agreed to let :</p>
<ul>
<li>us process all their personal data; and</li>
<li>you receive any data protection notices for them.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you send information for someone else, you are confirming that you have told them :</p>
<ul>
<li>which data they must give;</li>
<li>which information is voluntary; and</li>
<li>how they can access and, if necessary, correct the data we hold about them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The information we collect during registration or enrolment</h3>
<p>When you register with us, you (or the person registering for you) must tell us :</p>
<ul>
<li>your full name;</li>
<li>your sex;</li>
<li>your date of birth;</li>
<li>your address;</li>
<li>your employment status;</li>
<li>where you heard about us;</li>
<li>if you have done any learning in the last three years.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also request other information including your title, middle name, phone number and email address, but you don't have to give us these details (except that you must provide us with an e-mail address and telephone number where you buy a course online).
Following registration and/or enrolment via the website, we, or our approved learning providers, may request additional personal data from you in order to further support your learning.  You do not have to provide this information, but if you do not, you may not get the most out of your learning.
When you register, we will give you a username and ask you for a password. You will also be asked to give the answer to a question you choose which will identify you.</p>

<h3>Other information we collect to see if you can have government funding</h3>
<p>If government funding is available for any of our courses, you need to answer some other questions to see if you are eligible for funding. If you wish to avail of any such funding, you will be asked about :</p>
<ul>
<li>your age;</li>
<li>your education so far;</li>
<li>your citizenship status; and</li>
<li>where you live and how long you have lived there.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following registration and/or enrolment via the website, we, or our approved learning providers, may require additional information from you in order to support an application for funding.  If you do not want to provide us with this information, we will not be able to offer you the course at the reduced price.</p>

<h3>The information we collect when you access course materials</h3>
<p>We collect information about how you use course materials to monitor your learning and improve our users' learning experience.</p>

<h3>The information we collect when you enter competitions</h3>
<p>From time to time we may run competitions and promotions on the website. If you enter these, we may ask for your name, address, e-mail address and username so that we can administer and control the competition and, of course, notify the winners.</p>

<h3>Other information we collect</h3>
<p> If you require a free information pack, we ask you to provide us with the information on the "request more information" form on the website, including : </p>
<ul>
  <li> Title; </li>
  <li> Full name; </li>
  <li> Full address; </li>
  <li> An indication of courses in which you are interested; </li>
  <li> Whether you would like to know where your nearest <strong>learndirect</strong> centres are; </li>
  <li> Where you heard about us. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can also decide to give us your home and mobile telephone numbers and your email address but you only need to do this if you want us and/or our approved learning providers to contact you about <strong>learndirect</strong> developments and offers. </p>
<p>If you do not register as a member but use one of our online tests to test your skills, we ask you to provide your full name. This information is not retained by us but is used only when sending you your test results. </p>
<p>You may also provide personal data through:</p>
<ul>
  <li>calls to our helplines;</li>
  <li>letters and e-mails;</li>
  <li>customer feedback forms;</li>
  <li>our messaging system; or</li>
  <li>any conference, chatroom, message board, *Paging, web space or other learning or communications facility operated by us. </li>
</ul>
<p> *Please be aware that 'Paging' is where others using <strong>learndirect</strong> 
  forums and chat can send a message direct to your computer whilst you are also 
  in the<strong> learndirect</strong> forums and chat area.</p>
<p>We may record calls to helplines for quality and training purposes only. We will store calls for about three months and we will keep them confidential. In general, if you contact us, we may keep a record of your query or complaint for a reasonable time in case you contact us again. </p>
<h3>Sensitive personal data</h3>
<p>When you register as a member or learner, you do not have to provide us with sensitive personal information.  Where we invite you to provide such information, we will ask you to consent to our proposed uses of such data.</p>

<p>At enrolment you may be asked for sensitive personal information. If you do not wish to provide this information you may select the "Not Known/Not Provided" option.</p>

<p>You may also volunteer sensitive personal data to us or our approved learning providers, for example, when you submit a query or comment to us via the website or some other means of communication.  If you do so, you explicitly consent to our using such information as described in this Privacy Statement.  </p>

<p>Sensitive personal data includes details of your :</p>
<ul>
<li>race or ethnic origin;</li>
<li>political opinions;</li>
<li>religious or other beliefs;</li>
<li>trade-union membership;</li>
<li>physical or mental health;</li>
<li>sexual life; or</li>
<li>criminal records (including information about criminal proceedings and suspected criminal activities).</li>
</ul>

<h3>How we use the information we collect</h3>
<p> We use your personal information : </p>
<ul>
  <li>to answer your queries or complaints; </li>
  <li>to deliver our membership services, for example on-line tools to test your skills, chatrooms, message boards and Paging facilities; </li>
  <li>to support your learning; </li>
  <li>to provide course materials; </li>
  <li>to carry out administration; </li>
  <li>for general statistics and research; </li>
  <li>for obtaining any relevant professional advice; </li>
  <li>as may be required by law or in connection with legal proceedings (including where we intend to take legal proceedings), or as may be necessary to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Third parties and sponsors</h3>
<p>To achieve the purposes set out in this privacy statement we may need to give your information to our service providers (including our approved learning providers), agents, professional advisors and auditors and to your tutor(s). When you enrol on a course, we will tell you which of our approved learning providers will be delivering and supporting your learning. Following registration and/or enrolment via the website, all of our approved learning providers will have access to your name and contact details to help us deliver our services to you.</p>

<p>We may also give your information to third parties who may take over part or all of the <b>learndirect</b> business in the future, but only for the purposes outlined in this privacy statement. If your employer, trade organisation or other group is sponsoring you, we may give the personal information we have collected to your sponsor to monitor your learning.</p>

<p>Communications between you and your tutor using any of the tools or functions we make available to you (including unopened messages sent via our messaging system) may be monitored by <b>learndirect</b> staff to check the quality of tutor support.  <b>learndirect</b> staff and auditors may also access these communications when we want to investigate or audit learner funding arrangements.</p>

<h3>Keeping you informed</h3>
<p>We, and our approved learning providers, will use your information to send you regular updates about :</p>
<ul>
<li>our services and materials;</li>
<li>additions to the website; and</li>
<li>specific activities such as customer feedback surveys and competitions.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to join <b>learndirect</b> but do not wish to receive this information, untick the relevant boxes on the 'join us' page (inviting us to contact you by post and for customer feedback purposes).   If you do wish to receive information about <b>learndirect</b> developments and offers by telephone, email and/or SMS, please invite us to contact you by ticking the appropriate boxes.  If at any time, you change your mind about receiving updates, you can change your preferences using "your details" on your learner home page.</p>

<p>If you have not registered as a member but are simply requesting a free information pack, you can invite us to send you updates by ticking the appropriate boxes on the "request more information" page.   If you change your mind about us contacting you for this purpose, please ring us on <b>08000 150 450</b> or <a href="mailto:enquiries@learndirect.net?Subject=Privacy Statement query">e-mail us</a>.</p>

<p>We will never use your sensitive data for marketing purposes or to target you for customer feedback purposes without your express consent.</p>

<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>We, and our approved learning providers, may use your personal data to process or to support any application made for funding associated with your learning. For these purposes we, or our approved learning providers, will share the information you supply with the <a href="http://www.lsc.gov.uk">Learning and Skills Council (LSC)</a> in England. The LSC may in turn share it with the European Social Fund, or other government agencies that may provide funding for your course, including the <a href="http://www.delni.gov.uk">Department for Employment and Learning</a> in Northern Ireland and the <a href="http://www.elwa.ac.uk">National Council for Education and Learning Wales</a>.  We, or our approved learning providers, may also share it with the <a href="http://www.ali.gov.uk">Adult Learning Inspectorate</a> so that it can check our use of public monies.  If you do not want us to use your personal data for these purposes, we will not be able to offer you the course at the reduced price.</p> 

<p>At the point this information is collected you will be asked to indicate if you do not wish to be contacted by the LSC or its partners in respect of courses, surveys and research. Please read the <a href="/home/ilr/lscdpa/" target="_blank">LSC Data Protection Statement</a></p> 

<p>We, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may use your personal data to investigate a suspected misuse of public monies or other fraudulent activity by any person relating to your learning activity.  In doing so, we, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may disclose your information to other government agencies (e.g. the <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk">Department for Work and Pensions</a>) to establish whether there has been any duplication of funding for your course.  We may also contact you for the purposes of any such investigation.</p>

<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>We and/or the approved learning providers delivering and supporting your learning are also required to provide statistics to all of the government agencies mentioned under the heading 'Funding' and to the <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk">Department for Education and Skills</a>, in order that they can carry out checks on our funding arrangements and our performance and for research and statistical purposes.  This helps us, and our approved learning providers, to maintain our funding.  Where such information is supplied, it is provided in an aggregated manner so that whilst such authorities may be aware of, for example, the number, geographic location and sex of persons using <b>learndirect,</b> you cannot be personally identified from this information.</p>

<h3>Requests for information</h3>
<p>If you have not registered as a learner or member but are simply making an enquiry or request for information, we will use your personal information to reply to your enquiry or request. We will not use this information for marketing purposes without your permission or unless you invite us to do so.</p>

<h3>Protecting your personal information</h3>
<p>As a registered data controller, we are required to take appropriate technical measures to protect your personal information including making a regular backup of our system and data. We have security measures in place to make sure any personal information we collect is secure. Your account is password protected and all information including your password is on a secure server, which only a limited number of employees and sub-contractors can access. All parties with access to your information are subject to confidentiality obligations.  If you think someone else knows your password, or is using it, tell us immediately and change your password using the "change my password" option under "your details" on your learner home page.</p>

<p>Even though we take appropriate technical steps to protect your security, you should remember that data transmission over the internet cannot always be guaranteed as 100% secure so you use the website at your own risk.</p>

<p>Please look at the terms and conditions on this website for our policy on purging emails and webspace.  The terms and conditions tell you when we may close your account and delete all your records, files and information.</p>

<h3>Keeping your personal data</h3>
<p>We keep personal data :</p>
<ul>
  <li>for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for;</li>
<li>as required by law; or</li>
<li>to enforce or defend legal claims.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes we will keep information that you have deleted, for example messages sent by you to your tutor, as a record of your learning experience. We will keep this information for a reasonable time.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies are small text files which are sent to your browser by a web server and stored on your personal computer's hard disk. We use cookies on our site to :</p>
<ul>
  <li>cut down the number of times you have to type in data;</li>
  <li>record the success of advertising, to target advertising and to track visitor 
    usage; and</li>

<p>We will not use information collected from people under 18 for marketing. Government funding is not available to learners under 19.</p>

<p>Although anyone can take part in competitions and promotions, we will send notice of a win or prize directly to the parent or guardian identified during registration.  Where a winner is under 18, we will not publish his or her personal details unless we have obtained the consent of the parent or guardian during registration.</p>
