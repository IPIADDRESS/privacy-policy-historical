    <a id="1" name="1"></a>Giving information for other people
</h3>
<p>
    When you give us information about another person, the other person must
    have agreed to let :
</p>
<ul>
    <li>us process all their personal data; and
    </li>
    <li>you receive any data protection notices for them.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When you send information for someone else, you are confirming that you
    have told them :
</p>
<ul>
    <li>which data they must give;
    </li>
    <li>which information is voluntary; and
    </li>
    <li>how they can access and, if necessary, correct the data we hold about
    them.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <a id="2" name="2"></a>The information we collect during the enrolment process
</h3>
<p>
    When you enrol with us, you (or the person enrolling you) must tell us :

    don't have to give us these details. Following enrolment via the website,
    we, or our approved learning providers, may request additional personal
    data from you in order to further support your learning. You do not have to
    provide this information, but if you do not, you may not get the most out
    of your learning. However, we ask you to tell us whether you have achieved
    Level 2 in English and Maths.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that when you enrol on a <strong>learndirect</strong> course
    that leads to qualification such as an NVQ, we send non sensitive personal
    information to the relevant awarding bodies so that they can undertake the
    administration associated with your qualification.
</p>
<p>
    Before you enrol, we will give you a username and ask you for a password.
    You will also be given a learner reference number and asked to give the
    answer to a question you choose which will identify you.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="3" name="3"></a>Other information we collect to see if you can have
        government funding
</h3>
<p>
    If government funding is available for any of our courses, you need to
    answer some other questions to see if you are eligible for funding. If you
    wish to take advantage of any such funding, you will be asked about :

<ul>
    <li>your age;
    </li>
    <li>your education so far;

    approved learning providers to contact you about
    <strong>learndirect</strong> developments and offers in this way.

    <a id="9" name="9"></a>Third parties and sponsors
</h3>
<p>
    To achieve the purposes set out in this privacy statement we may need to
    give your information to our service providers (including our approved
    learning providers), agents, professional advisors and auditors and to your
    tutor(s). When you enrol on a course, we will tell you which of our
    approved learning providers will be delivering and supporting your
    learning. Following enrolment via the website, all of our approved learning
    providers will have access to your name, date of birth, address, username,
    learner reference number and which <strong>learndirect</strong> courses you
    have enrolled on in the past as well as details relating to these
    <strong>learndirect</strong> courses to help us deliver our services to
    you.
</p>
<p>
    We may also give your information to third parties who may take over part
    or all of the <strong>learndirect</strong> business in the future, but only
    for the purposes outlined in this privacy statement. If your employer,
    trade organisation or other group is sponsoring you, we may give the
    personal information we have collected to your sponsor to monitor your
    learning.
</p>
<p>
    Communications between you and your tutor using any of the tools or
    functions we make available to you (including unopened messages sent via
    our messaging system) may be monitored by <strong>learndirect</strong>
    staff to check the quality of tutor support. <strong>learndirect</strong>
    staff and auditors may also access these communications when we want to
    investigate or audit learner funding arrangements.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="10" name="10"></a>Keeping you informed
</h3>
<p>
    We, and our approved learning providers, will use your information to send
    you regular updates about :
</p>
<ul>
    <li>our services and materials;
    </li>
    <li>additions to the website; and
    </li>
    <li>specific activities such as customer feedback surveys and competitions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you enrol on a <strong>learndirect</strong> course but do not wish to
    receive this information, untick the relevant boxes on the ’contact
    permissions’ page (inviting us to contact you by post and for customer
    feedback purposes). If you do wish to receive information about
    <strong>learndirect</strong> developments and offers by telephone, email
    and/or SMS, please invite us to contact you by ticking the appropriate
    boxes. If at any time, you change your mind about receiving updates, you
    can change your preferences using "your details" on your learner home page.

    send you updates by ticking the appropriate boxes on the "request more
    information" page. If you change your mind about us contacting you for this
    purpose, please ring us on <strong>08000&nbsp;101&nbsp;901</strong> or

    We will never use your sensitive personal data for marketing purposes or to
    target you for customer feedback purposes without your express consent.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="11" name="11"></a>Funding
</h3>
<p>
    We, and our approved learning providers, may use your personal data to
    process or to support any application made for funding associated with your
    learning. For these purposes we, or our approved learning providers, will
    share the information you supply with the
    <a href="http://www.lsc.gov.uk/">Learning and Skills Council (LSC)</a> in
    England. The LSC may in turn share it with the European Social Fund, or
    other government agencies that may provide funding for your course,
    including the <a href="http://www.wales.gov.uk/">Welsh Assembly
    Government</a>&nbsp;for learners who enrol in Welsh centres. If you are a
    learner between the ages of 16-19 years of age (or up to 25 years of age
    for learners with learning difficulties or disabilities), we are required
    by the LSC to notify Connexions when you leave, or intend to leave
    learning. We, or our approved learning providers, may also share it with
    the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills
    (Ofsted) so that it can check our use of public monies. If you do not want
    us to use your personal data for these purposes, we will not be able to
    offer you the course at the reduced price.
</p>
<p>
    At the point this information is collected you will be asked to indicate if
    you do not wish to be contacted by the LSC or its partners in respect of
    courses, surveys and research. Please read the
    <a href="http://www.learndirect.co.uk/home/ilr/lscdpa/" target="_blank">LSC Data Protection Statement</a>
</p>
<p>
    We, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may use
    your personal data to investigate a suspected misuse of public monies or
    other fraudulent activity by any person relating to your learning activity.
    In doing so, we, or the government agency providing funding for your
    course, may disclose your information to other government agencies (e.g.
    the <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/">Department for Work and Pensions</a>)
    to establish whether there has been any duplication of funding for your
    course. We may also contact you for the purposes of any such investigation.

    Managing Information Across Partners (MIAP) and the Unique Learner Number
    (ULN)
</h3>
<p>
    The Managing Information Across Partners (MIAP) service is operated by the
    Learning and Skills Council (LSC) for learners aged 14 years and over and
    learners registering for relevant post-14 qualifications.&nbsp; MIAP is
    responsible for the operation of the Learner Registration Service and also
    the creation of a Learner Record.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Learner Registration Service (LRS)</em>
</p>
<p>
    By enrolling with Ufi, you agree to us providing MIAP with the following
    personal data so that MIAP can allocate you a Unique Learner Number (ULN):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Given Name
    </li>
    <li>Family Name
    </li>
    <li>Gender
    </li>
    <li>Date of birth
    </li>
    <li>Postcode
    </li>
    <li>Details of how your identity was verified
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The LRS will enable organisations listed in section 537A of the Education
    Act (<a href="http://www.miap.gov.uk/">www.miap.gov.uk</a>) to access your

<p>
    By enrolling with Ufi, you also agree to us providing your participation
    and achievement data to MIAP so that MIAP can create and maintain a Learner
    Record.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ULN will enable you to access the Ufi
    participation and achievement data held in your Learner Record via a
    website and will allow MIAP to share this data with those organisations
    listed in section 537A of the Education Act
    (<a href="http://www.miap.gov.uk/">www.miap.gov.uk</a>), if you tell Ufi
    that you are happy for MIAP to do so. You can decide to opt out of MIAP
    sharing your participation and achievement data at any time and current
    details of how to do so can be found at
    <a href="http://www.miap.gov.uk/">www.miap.gov.uk</a> or by telephoning

    <a id="12" name="12"></a>Statistics
</h3>
<p>
    We and/or the approved learning providers delivering and supporting your
    learning are also required to provide statistics to all of the government
    agencies mentioned under the heading 'Funding' and to the
    <a href="http://www.dius.gov.uk/">Department for Innovation, Universities
    and Skills</a>, in order that they can carry out checks on our funding
    arrangements and our performance and for research and statistical purposes.
    This helps us, and our approved learning providers, to maintain our
    funding. Where such information is supplied, it is provided in an
    aggregated manner so that whilst such authorities may be aware of, for
    example, the number, geographic location and sex of persons using
    <strong>learndirect,</strong> you cannot be personally identified from this
    information.<br>
    However, we may provide information that identifies you (your name, date of
    birth, address and postcode) to the Department of Work and Pensions so that
    they can check whether <strong>learndirect</strong> learners have
    progressed into employment and compile statistical information about such
    progression. You will not be identifiable from the statistical information
    compiled.
