If you HAVE enabled "Do Not Track" functionality in your web browser, then LeadLander will only personally identify you in our own LeadLander reports, used by our own employees, and will NOT personally identify you in the LeadLander reports of other LeadLander customers as you visit their websites.
If you HAVE enabled "Do Not Track" fucntionality in your web browser, then your personally identifiable LeadLander cookies will expire within 48 hours.

or delete the information.

Information security

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, 
storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

We restrict access to account information to LeadLander employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf. 
These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

Accessing and updating account information

When you use LeadLander's services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your account information and either to correct any data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data 
at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. 
We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests 
that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical 
(for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction,
we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information, 
residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems. Please review the service Help Centers for more information.


LeadLander regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints, it is LeadLander's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. 
We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot 
be resolved between LeadLander and an individual.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. 
We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification 
of Privacy Policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
