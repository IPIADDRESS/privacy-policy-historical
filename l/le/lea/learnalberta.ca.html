			automatically gather any personal information from you, such as your name, 
			address, phone number or e-mail address. This information is only obtained if 
			you supply it voluntarily, usually through contacting us via e-mail. 
			<p>Any personal information you do provide is managed according to the Alberta 
			Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (see section 6 below). This 
			means that, at the point of collection, you will be informed that your personal 
			information is being collected, the purpose for which it is being collected, and 
			a contact person who can answer any questions you may have regarding the 
			collection activity will be identified.
