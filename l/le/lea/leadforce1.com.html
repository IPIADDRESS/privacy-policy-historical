		<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
		<h5>LeadForce1 Privacy Policy</h5>
		<p>We  help marketers better target their audience and avoid pricing models designed  to increase the volume of communications. While MarketForceOne's (MarketForceOne  Inc. owns LeadForce1) solutions are focused on improving marketing results and  lowering costs, we are also reducing unwanted email, phone, and postal  communications by as much as 50%.</p>

		<p><strong>Anti-Abuse</strong></p>

		<p>If you suspect a client of abusing our services,  please contact us at&nbsp;<u><a href="mailto:abuse@leadforce1.com">abuse@leadforce1.com</a></u>. All complaints are investigated, and you will  receive a response on the action we will take to resolve the issue.	</p>

		<p><strong>This policy describes how LeadForce1  uses and protects your personal information.</strong><strong> </strong><br>

          </p>

		<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>

		This privacy policy describes how we handle the  personal information that you supply to us or concerning your use of our  services available through <a href="https://www.leadforce1.com">www.leadforce1.com</a>,  or any MarketForceOne Inc. web sites (the "Sites") and applies generally to any  affiliated web sites. By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in  registration, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and  disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

		<p>This Privacy Policy is effective on September 5, 2008 for any  current users, and upon acceptance for all new users.<br>
          </p>
		<p><strong>Collection</strong></p>
		You can browse the Sites without telling us who  you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us  your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to  provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage  of that information to our servers located in the United States.<br>

We may collect and store the following personal information:

<ul type="square">

  <li>email address,       physical contact information, and (depending on the service used)       sometimes financial information, such as credit card;</li>

  <li>transactional       information based on your activities on the Sites (such as purchases you       make, purchase content, and searches conducted, all as they relate to your       account or purchases);</li>

  <li>billing and other       information you provide;</li>

  <li>correspondence       through the Sites, and correspondence sent to us;</li>

  <li>computer sign-on data, statistics on page views,  traffic to and from the Sites, and ad data, other information, including IP  address and standard Web log information; and supplemental information from  third parties. </li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>

<p>We don't sell or rent the personal information  we collect from your using our Sites to third parties for their marketing  purposes without your consent. We may combine your information with information  we collect from other companies (such as demographic data) to improve and  personalize our services. If you don't wish to receive marketing communications  from us, simply "unsubscribe" located at the end of any marketing  communication. </p>

<p><strong>Use of Information</strong></p>

<p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal  information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized  experience. You agree that we may use your personal information to:</p>

<ul type="square">

  <li>provide the       services and customer support you request;</li>

  <li>resolve disputes,       collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;</li>

  <li>prevent       potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User       Agreement;</li>

  <li>customize,       measure, and improve our services and the Sitesâ€™ content and layout;</li>

  <li>share service       updates, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences;</li>

  <li>Our Disclosure of       Your Information</li>

  <li>We may disclose       personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our       policies, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety.</li>

  <li>We may also share       your personal information with:</li>

  <li>Employees and       agents of MarketForceOne Inc. in order to help detect and prevent       potentially illegal acts;</li>

  <li>service providers       under contract who help with our business operations;</li>

  <li>other third       parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information;</li>

  <li>those serving       apparently valid subpoenas;</li>

  <li>other business entities, should we plan to merge  with, or be acquired by that business entity. </li>

</ul>

<p>Without  limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy we will not otherwise  disclose your personal information &nbsp;without your consent except when we believe in  good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent  physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>We use "cookies" (small files placed  on your hard drive) on certain pages of the Sites to help analyze our Web page  flow, customize our services, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote  trust and safety. We use cookies to provide services to you.</p>

<p>  A few important things you should know about cookies are that: </p>

<ul type="square">

  <li>We use cookies to       help identify you and maintain your signed-in status.</li>

  <li>Most cookies are       "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted       from your hard drive at the end of a session.</li>

  <li>You are always free to decline our cookies if  your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of the Sites.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cookies allow:</p>

<ul type="square">

  <li>You to enter your       password less frequently during your use of our Sites.</li>

  <li>Us to provide       information that is targeted to your interests.</li>

  <li>Us to promote and       enforce trust and safety.</li>

  <li>Us to offer       certain features that are only available through the use of cookies.</li>

  <li>Us to measure       promotional effectiveness.</li>

</ul>

<p>Us to analyze our Web page flow.</p>

<p>You  are always free to decline cookies if your browser permits. However, if you  decline cookies, you may not be able to use certain features on the Sites, and  you may be required to reenter your password more frequently while using the  Sites.</p>

<p><strong>Account Protection</strong></p>

<p>Your password is the key to your account. Use  unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do not disclose your LeadForce1  password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information  with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the  name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose  substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to  legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been  compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify us and change your  password.</p>

<p><strong>Accessing, Reviewing and  Changing Your Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>You can see, review and change most of your  personal information by logging into the Sites. Generally, we will not manually  modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your  identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it  changes or is inaccurate. Upon your request, we will close your account and  remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible,  based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do  retain personal information from closed accounts in order to comply with law,  prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems,  assist with any investigations, enforce our User Agreement, and take other  actions otherwise permitted by law.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>Your information is stored on our servers  located in the United States.  We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use certain tools  (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal  information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you  probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions  or private communications. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect  your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal  information or private communications will always remain private.</p>

<p><strong>Phishing</strong></p>

<p>In order to protect yourself from email that  appears to be from LeadForce1, but may be from a disreputable third party, you  should never provide any personal information directly in response to an email  you believe you have received from us. Rather, you should always close any such  email, open your browser, log directly in to the Sites and change, update or  modify any such personal information only using our Sites. In the event that  you believe that you have received a request for personal information in an  email message that is made to appear that it was sent by us, please inform us  immediately.</p>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by  posting the amended terms on the Site. All amended terms automatically take  effect immediately after they are initially posted on the Site.
