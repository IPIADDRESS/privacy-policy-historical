						<span id="lblPrivacyPolicy"><h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<p><strong>Welcome</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for visiting NestleUSA.com. This privacy policy tells you how Nestlé USA uses personal information collected at this web site. Please read this privacy policy before submitting any personal information at this site. By using this site you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. We may infrequently change these practices, but any changes will be posted and changes will only apply to activities and information collected on a going forward basis.&nbsp; If we materially change how we use your previously collected personal information, we will notify you by email.&nbsp; You are encouraged to review the privacy policy whenever you visit to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.</p>
<p>The privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Policy pertain only to the on-line collection of information.</p>
<p><strong>Children’s Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We have no intention of collecting information from children at this web site.</p>
<p><strong>What We Collect and How We Use It</strong></p>
<p><em>Personally Identifiable Information</em></p>
<p>We collect the following personally identifiable information: name, postal address, email addresses, birthdate, and phone number. This information is only collected when voluntarily submitted by visitors to help fulfill a specific offer or request. For example: to receive email updates or newsletters about the site, our products and promotions; to send you samples, if offered and requested; to enter a specific sweepstakes or other on-line promotion; when a visitor registers as a member of a web site; to help personalize the web site for you; or to respond to a question or issue in a contact or email section. Note if you choose not to provide this information, certain personalized features of the web site may not be available to you. The information you provide is used to fulfill your specific request, unless you give us permission to use it in another manner, for example when registering for a sweepstakes, you may opt in to receive future information from Nestlé.</p>
<p>Some web sites may ask for a birthday for screening purposes. </p>
<p>We have no intention of collecting information from children at this web site.</p>
<p>To make the registration process easier, Nestlé has a "one time" registration feature, which is used across many of Nestlé's web sites. This means that if you have registered at one Nestlé site, and then enter your email address to register at another site, this new site will recognize you as a returning visitor. Don't worry; you must still opt in to receiving future information from the new Nestlé site or Nestlé product.</p>
<p>If you elect to receive information from us, you may receive information by regular mail or email, depending on the information you provided at registration. From time to time, our outbound communications may feature products/services from other reputable organizations, companies or products that may interest you. Your personally identifiable information is not shared with these other companies. All mailings come from Nestlé or its agents, who are bound to keep information confidential.</p>
<p><span>We do not share personally identifiable information collected at this site with third parties, except for the limited instances noted below. The exceptions are: <!--?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /--><o:p></o:p></span></p>
