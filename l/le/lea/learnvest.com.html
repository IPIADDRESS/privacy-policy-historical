If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.</p><h4>Third-party websites</h4><p>There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the “privacy” link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</p><h4>How you can access your information</h4><p>If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account using the Login link at the upper right side of the page. You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us <a href="mailto:feedback@learnvest.com">feedback@learnvest.com</a> or by contacting us postal mail at the contact information listed below. You may also choose to close your account by emailing us at <a href="mailto:feedback@learnvest.com">feedback@learnvest.com</a>.</p><p>After you close your account, you will not be able to sign in to our website or access any of your personal information.

In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties’ policies.</p><h4>Your choices about collection and use of your information</h4><ul><li>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; rate, review or comment on articles and merchants, or initiate other transactions on our website.</li><li>You will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us.

For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information. We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email, such as bank account numbers, social security numbers, etc.. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p><h4>Blogs, bulletin boards, reviews and chat rooms</h4><p>We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others, as well as post reviews of products, establishments, and the like, or upload content (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.). Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use, found in our Security/Legal section. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. To request removal of your personal information, contact us at <a href="mailto:feedback@learnvest.com" target="_blank">feedback@learnvest.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p><h4>Visiting our websites from outside the United States</h4><p>This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our website from residents of the United States. If you are visiting our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.</p><h4>No Rights of Third Parties</h4><p>This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.</p><h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4><p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the “last updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an email address), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website. We recommend that you check our website from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.</p><h4>How to contact us</h4><p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our information-handling practices, or if you would like to request information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please contact us by e-mail or postal mail as follows:</p><p><strong>Privacy Officer</strong><br> <a href="mailto:legal@learnvest.com">legal@learnvest.com</a><br> LearnVest<br> 740 Broadway, 10th floor<br> New York, NY 10003</p><h4>Linked information</h4><h5>Cookies</h5><p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. For example, when you sign in to our website, we will record your user or member ID and the name on your user or member profile in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of sites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our authorized service providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising. You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click “Help” in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of our website may not function properly. We may allow third-parties, including advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party’s privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a>).</p><h5>Web Beacons</h5><p>Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.</p><p><em>Last Updated: September 22, 2011</em></p></div></div></div></div></div><br class="clear-fix"></div><div class="not-supported"><div class="inner"><h3>UH OH!
