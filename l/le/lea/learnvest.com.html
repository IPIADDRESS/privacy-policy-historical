<h3>How we protect your personal information</h3>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.02em;">We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information (such as credit card number and/or geo-location data) between your system and ours, we encrypt the transmission of that information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, and we also use anti-virus software and firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information. We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure e-mail, such as bank account numbers, social security numbers, etc. Notably, LearnVest does not require, request or otherwise collect users’ social security number under any circumstances and we encourage you not to voluntarily share your social security number to LearnVest whether by e-mail, on the website or on any other media. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at </span><a style="letter-spacing: 0.02em;" href="mailto:feedback@learnvest.com"><span class="s1">feedback@learnvest.com</span></a><span style="letter-spacing: 0.02em;">.</span></p>
<h2>We may share personal information</h2>
<p>We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities on our website or while using our services.</p>
<p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;<b>We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</b></p>
<h3>We may share personal information with:</h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5">Authorized service providers: We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include processing credit card payments, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our website. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.</li>

<li class="li5"><span class="s4">­</span>For our premium members, we may share information with affiliated financial companies with whom we may market products jointly.</li>
<li class="li5"><span class="s4">­</span>In response to a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from law enforcement or other government or regulatory agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.</li>
<li class="li5"><span class="s4">­</span>When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li5">If LearnVest is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via e-mail and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</li>
<li class="li5">To any other third party with your prior consent to do so.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Third Parties</h2>
<p>Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling, and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.</p>
<h3>Third-Party websites</h3>
<p>There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy policies of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the “privacy” link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</p>
<h3>No Rights of Third Parties</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.</p>
<h2>How you can access your information</h2>

If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account (including geo-location data) for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our website or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:feedback@learnvest.com"><span class="s1">feedback@learnvest.com</span></a>. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties’ policies.</p>
<h2>Your choices about collection and use of your information</h2>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5">You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in your being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; rate, review or comment on articles and merchants; or initiate other transactions on our website.</li>
<li class="li5">You will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 business days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional e-mail communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as an event provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change your preferences directly with that third party.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Choice/Opt-Out</h2>
<p>You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing e-mails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these e-mails or you can contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:feedback@learnvest.com"><span class="s1">feedback@learnvest.com</span></a><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<h2>Invite-A-Friend</h2>
<p>You can import contacts from your Outlook or other e-mail account address book to tell a friend about our website using a third party service provider. If you choose to use this feature, we do not store your usernames or passwords.<br>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our website, we will ask you for your friend’s name and e-mail address. We will automatically send your friend an e-mail inviting him or her to visit the website. We will also send a one-time reminder e-mail if he or she has not created an account within 7 days. LearnVest stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail and for tracking the success of our referral program.<br>
Your friend may contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:feedback@learnvest.com"><span class="s1">feedback@learnvest.com</span></a>&nbsp;to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<h2>Job applicants</h2>
<p>If your personal information is submitted through our website when applying for a position with our company, the information will be used solely in connection with considering and acting upon your application. We may retain your personal information for a period of time, but only for the purpose of considering your application for current or future available positions. This information may be shared with third-party service providers retained by us to collect, maintain, and analyze candidate submissions for job postings.<br>
Please refer to “Your choices about collection and use of your information.”</p>
<h2>Blogs, bulletin boards, reviews, and chat rooms</h2>
<p>We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others; communicate with others; post reviews of products, establishments, and the like; and upload content (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.). Our blog is hosted and managed by a third party application called Disqus, which may require you to register to post a comment. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly viewable webpages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your e-mail address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. We do not have access or control of the information posted to the blog. You will need to contact or login into the third-party application if you want the personal information that was posted to the comments section removed. To learn how the third-party application uses your information, please review their privacy policy.</p>
<h2>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</h2>
<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. Visitors under 13 years of age are not permitted to use and/or submit their personal information at any Site. We do not knowingly solicit or collect information from visitors under 13 years of age. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information about an individual under 13 years of age, that information will be immediately deleted from our website. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate and monitor the interactive activities of their children.</p>
<h2>Social Media Widgets</h2>
<p>Our website includes Social Media Features and Widgets, such as the Share button or interactive mini-programs that run on our website. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and&nbsp;may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.

Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>

Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Linked Financial Information</h2>
<h3><b></b>Cookies</h3>
<p><b></b>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. For example, when you sign in to our website, we will record your user or member ID and the name on your user or member profile in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of sites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our authorized service providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our website, content and advertising. You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click “Help” in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of our website may not function properly. We may allow third parties, including advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our website. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party’s privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/"><span class="s1">www.networkadvertising.org</span></a>).</p>
<h3>Web Beacons</h3>
<p>Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in e-mail) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.</p>
<h2>Third party collection and use of your data</h2>
<p>When you use or connect to a LearnVest website or download a LearnVest App by or through a Third Party Platform, such as Facebook or other social networking website, you allow us to access and/or collect certain information from your Third Party Platform profile/account (such as your Facebook account) or via any cookies placed on your device by such Third Party Platform as permitted by the terms of the agreement and your privacy settings with the Third Party Platform. We will share such information with the Third Party Platform for their use as permitted by the terms of the agreement and your privacy setting with the Third Party Platform.</p>
<p>We will share some of the information we collect from you upon install of the App with vendors and other service providers who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the services we provide to you and/or for analytics purposes, which may require the reproduction and display of such information in an aggregated and anonymized manner such that will not identify you in any way.</p>
<p>You may “opt out” of the collection of your information for third party analytics purposes by following the directions provided by our third party analytics vendor located at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mobileapptracking.com/privacy-policy/"><span class="s1">www.mobileapptracking.com/privacy-policy</span></a>. If you “opt out” with our third party analytics provider, that action is specific to the information we collect specifically for that provider and does not limit our ability to collect information from you, under the terms of this privacy policy, for other vendors.</p>
