			In this Privacy Statement, you and your means you the applicant. We, us or our means LeadFlash.com.<br><br>
			<strong>Goal Statement</strong><br>At LeadFlash.com, our goal is to meet the needs of our customers. We respect the privacy of our customers and we believe you have the right to expect that information you entrust to us will be treated with appropriate discretion. As part of our Privacy Policy, we have adopted the following principles to serve as standards.<br><br>
			<strong>Recognition of Customer's Expectations of Privacy</strong><br>Because LeadFlash.com recognizes that you have the right to privacy, we also recognize that you have the right to expect your personal financial information to remain private and secure. While certain information is critical to providing quality service, we cannot overlook the fact that one of our most important assets is our customers' trust. Therefore, the safekeeping of customer information is a priority at LeadFlash.com.<br><br>
			<strong>Our Collection, Our Customers and Use of Information About You</strong><br>Information about our customers is accumulated from a variety of sources. Some of the information is provided to LeadFlash.com directly by you. Other information could be obtained from outside sources. We will limit the use and collection of information about our customers to that which is necessary to administer our business, provide exceptional service, and mitigating potential risks or losses to LeadFlash.com. We will use this information only in accordance with the principles indicated in this policy.<br><br>

These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including look up and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation and email marketing.<br><br>
			USA PATRIOT Act. In order to prevent the United States payment system from being used to finance terrorist activities or for money laundering, federal law now requires that we obtain from you and verify information establishing your identity. We must have your full name, your current address, your social security or other taxpayer identification number and your date of birth. As with other information we collect, this information will be used and transferred only as permitted by law.

			<strong>Security Procedures to Protect Information</strong><br>LeadFlash.com is committed to the security of your financial and personal information. All of our operational and data processing systems are in a secure environment that protects your account information from being accessed by third parties.<br><br>
			<strong>Restrictions on the Disclosure of Account Information</strong><br>Except as otherwise provided in this privacy policy, it is LeadFlash.com policy not to reveal specific information about customer accounts or other personally identifiable data to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use unless: 1) the information is provided to help complete a customer-initiated transaction; 2) the customer requests or authorizes it; 3) The information is provided to a reputable credit bureau or similar information reporting agency; 4) the disclosure is required or allowed by law (e.g. subpoena, investigation of fraudulent activity, requested by regulator, etc.); or 5) the customer has been informed about the possibility of disclosure for marketing purposes through a prior notice and given the opportunity to decline or "opt out", whenever required or as permitted by law.<br><br>
			<strong>Responding to Customer Inquiries</strong><br>Customers who have questions about these Privacy Principles or have a question about the privacy of their customer information can contact us at <a href="mailto:info@LeadFlash.com">info@LeadFlash.com</a>.<br><br>
			<strong>Protection of Customer Information on our Web Site</strong><br>LeadFlash.com protects the privacy or customer information sent to and from our web-sites by utilizing the same security and privacy standards that are applied to traditional financial transactions.
