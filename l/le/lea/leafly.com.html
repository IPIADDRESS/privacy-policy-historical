    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h2>
</hgroup>
<p style="padding-bottom:0;margin-bottom:10px;">At Leafly we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
    <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
    <li>In our product, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
    <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law or protect our rights.</li>   
</ul>
<p>
    It is Leafly’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
</p>
<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p>Like most website operators, Leafly collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Leaf.ly’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Leaf.ly’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Leaf.ly may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Leaf.ly also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Leafly does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Leaf.ly’s websites choose to interact with Leaf.ly in ways that require Leafly to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Leaf.ly gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an username and an optional email address. Leaf.ly collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Leaf.ly. Leaf.ly does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
<p>Leaf.ly may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Leafly may monitor the most popular strains and may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Leafly does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Leaf.ly discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Leaf.ly’s behalf or to provide services available at Leafly’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Leafly’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Leafly will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Leaf.ly discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Leaf.ly believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Leaf.ly, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Leaf.ly website and have supplied your email address, Leafly may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Leafly and our products, and we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Leaf.ly takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Leaf.ly uses cookies to help Leaf.ly identify and track visitors, their usage of Leaf.ly website, and their website access preferences. Leaf.ly visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Leaf.ly’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Leaf.ly’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Leaf.ly may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Leafly’s sole discretion. Leafly encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
