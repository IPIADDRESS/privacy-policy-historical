						Riot Games, Inc. ("us," "we," or "Company") is committed to respecting the privacy 
						rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of our website(s) (each, a "Site") and related subscription 
						service (the "Service"). We created this Privacy Policy (this "Policy") to give you confidence as you visit and 
						use the Site or otherwise subscribe to the Service, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information 
						practices and the protection of privacy. This Policy is only applicable to our Site, and not to any other websites 
						that you may be able to access from our Site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and 
						policies that differ materially from this Policy.
					</p>
					
					<h3>1.2. NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN</h3>
			
					<p>
						PLEASE NOTE: We are a general audience site, and do not direct any of our content specifically at children under 13 
						years of age. We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children�s privacy online. If we 
						learn or have reason to suspect that a Site user is under age 13, we will promptly delete any personal information 
						in that user�s account.

						assigned to computers on the Internet). No personal information about you is revealed in this process. Our Site 
						may also gather anonymous "traffic data" that does not personally identify you, but that may be helpful for 
						marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						(b) COOKIES. From time to time, we may use the standard "cookies" feature of major browser applications that allows 
						us to store a small piece of data on your computer about your visit to our Web site. We do not set any personally 
						identifiable information in cookies, nor do we employ any data capture mechanisms on our website other than cookies. 
						Cookies help us learn which areas of our site are useful and which areas need improvement. You can choose whether to 
						accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to disable this function, your
