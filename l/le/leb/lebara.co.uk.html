Your passwords and the answers to secret questions are your responsibility, and  must not be disclosed to any third party.

In such cases,  if they collect any data on their own behalf it will be covered by this policy  unless they inform you that they provide their own privacy policy. We do  endeavour to ensure that any partners we use apply the same high standards of  privacy and security over your information. However, we advise you to read  their policy carefully.</li>             <li><span dir="ltr"> </span>Security  of Communications<br clear="all">             Please be aware that communications over the Internet, such as e-mails and  Webmails, are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications  may route through a number of countries before being delivered - this is the  nature of the World Wide Web/Internet.

You should therefore ensure that you are familiar with the applicable  third party privacy policy before entering any personal information on a third  party site.</p>         <p><strong>9.4 Non-EEA Use of Information</strong><br clear="all">         The information you provide to us may be passed to third parties located  outside the European Economic Area.

However we will always  take steps to ensure that your information is used by third parties in  accordance with this policy. Additional terms and conditions may be presented  when signing up for specific products and services.</p>         <p><strong>9.5 Marketing Information from Third Parties</strong><br clear="all">         If you choose to receive marketing information from other companies, we will  only disclose your personal information to these companies where they have  undertaken not to use your personal information for any purpose other than to  provide information to you or other uses to which you have agreed. If you  decide that you no longer want to receive information from a particular  company, you should contact that company directly. You should be aware that if  you subsequently give any personal information to another company, the uses to  which that information may be put will be determined by that company's privacy  policy.</p>     </ol> </ol> <p><strong>10. Cookies </strong></p> <ol>     <p>10.1 We  use Cookies on our site and they can help a website to personalise your visit.
