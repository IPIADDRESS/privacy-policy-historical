TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES &amp; COOKIES</h2><p>LEZHIN and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers, may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.

We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings, and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies by adjusting individual browser settings. However, if you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use some features or areas of our websites may be limited.</p><p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.</p><p>We may also use tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain non-personal information that does not directly enable LEZHIN to identify you.</p><h2>4.

However, you hereby agree that LEZHIN may share your personal information with our affiliates to provide you our Service or information about other services and promotional materials. In addition, LEZHIN may share personal information with third party service providers that assist LEZHIN in providing you our Service. As a result, your information may be transferred to countries outside your residence.</p><p>When we share your personal information with third party vendors and suppliers, we require them to adhere to confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations.</p><p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Service or their assets changes, we may transfer your personal information to the new owner.</p><p>Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personal information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose personal information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation.</p><h2>5. SAFEGUARDS</h2><p>LEZHIN maintains appropriate safeguards that ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of the personal information we collect and store about our account holders. Personal information collected by LEZHIN is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and that are only accessible by authorized employees. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control (i.e., maintain data quality). Before we allow users to access their personal information, for example, we verify their identity by requesting that they submit information such as their username and password. We also take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties to whom we transfer personal information provide sufficient protection of such data.</p><p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the country of your residence. It may also be processed by personnel of our affiliates and third party service providers who may operate outside the country of your residence. In such case, we will take reasonable steps to require such third party in possession of your personal information to take commercially reasonable security measures to protect the information.</p><p>However, unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through our Service cannot be guaranteed; and (b) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.</p><h2>6.

LEZHIN is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites or services. If you are concerned about the privacy policy of a certain third party, you should read the privacy policy of the site or service to which you link before you submit any personal information.</p><p>We may also use Google remarketing services, which allow third parties, including Google, to serve advertisements to you on our behalf based on your activity on our Service. This involves placing in certain areas of our Service a small piece of code provided by Google. This code enables third parties, including Google, to place a cookie on your computer that tells them about your use of our Service and allows them to recognize you and display relevant advertisements when you visit other websites within the Google Display Network. We may also use similar remarketing services from other companies.
