We will use the Information you provide for the purpose of conducting the promotion (for example, to contact you if you have won).

The Site and/or third parties may use “cookies,” (which are small data files containing information about you that is stored on your hard drive), “embedded scripts”, and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect Additional Information automatically as you interact with the Site. Some cookies are used to make login to our Site easier (such as by remembering your User ID). Cookies also enable us to track your interaction with the Site and target your interests to enhance your Site experience (e.g., for tracking your sessions and use of the playbar, what videos you have in your playbar, etc.). We may also use Tracking Technologies to collect “clickstream” data, such as the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on our Site, pages viewed, content searched for, access times and other relevant statistics, and assign unique identifiers to the Device you use to access the Site for the same purposes. Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process. However, we may associate the information obtained through these Tracking Technologies with your Personal Information so we can better customize your Site experience and provide tailored advertisements and promotions related to your specific interests. By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site as described in this Privacy Policy.

Such services may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Site and other websites you have visited. Targeting services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.  The advertisements appearing on this Site may be delivered to you by our third party advertising partners. In the course of serving advertisements to this Site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.

<p>
This Site may offer merchandise and/or ticket purchase services, which may be offered by us or by one of our e-commerce partners. To the extent the merchandise and/or ticket purchase services are offered by one of our e-commerce partners, such e-commerce partner will be collecting and using the Personal Information you provide.

Please be aware that at times, at the request of or on behalf of our e-commerce partners, vendors or advertisers, LessThan3 may “pre-populate” forms with your Personal Information for your review, and, if you so choose, for submission to such e-commerce partners, vendors or advertisers.

We will use your billing address to verify your credit card or other payment information, and we will use your credit card or other payment information to allow you to pay for any products, services or downloads you purchase.

<p>
Additionally, we may use personal information that you provide, or that we learn about you to otherwise improve your use of the Site and the LessThan3 service.

<p>
Marketing and Promotional Communications. At times, you may be presented with the option of whether to receive certain marketing and promotional communications from us and others that we think will be of interest to you. Recipients of such communications can unsubscribe by either following the specific instructions included in such communications or you may “opt-out” of receiving marketing and promotional e-mails from us at any time by sending an email to us at info@LessThan3.com detailing your privacy request. Please note, however, that in order to keep you informed about the operation of our Site and related services, we may always send you emails and announcements that are needed for the proper functioning and administration of our Site, including for the purposes described in Section 2 above, in connection with your use of the Site. We may also have features that allow you to submit information, questions or feedback to us.

We will refer to these third parties as “Site service providers”. We use Site service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, activities, services, features and functions we bring you and we disclose your Information to Site service providers for the purpose of providing services to us. These Site service providers may temporarily store some information on their servers, but they may only use your Personal Information to provide LessThan3 with a specific service and not for any other purpose.

Other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not share your Personal Information with other third parties, apart from those acting as our agents in providing our Site to you, and which agree to use it only for that purpose and to keep the information secure and confidential. Also, please be aware that our affiliated companies, including all their respective business units, subsidiaries, affiliates and sites, entities into which our companies may be merged, or entities to which any of our assets, products, sites or operations may be transferred, may obtain from us and be able to use your Personal Information.

You may change your privacy preferences (e.g., choose to cease receiving certain communications or ask us not to share your Personal Information with a particular third party) by sending an email to us at info@LessThan3.com detailing your privacy request. Other privacy preferences (e.g., hiding your user profile or deactivating your user account) may be made by modifying your account settings on the Site.
