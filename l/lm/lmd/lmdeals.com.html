							<p><strong><em>Last revised September 9, 2003</em></strong></p>
							<p>Site59 is owned and operated by Site59.com, LLC 
								(<strong>"Site59," "we," "us"</strong>). We provide travel 
								packages and other goods and services (<strong>"Packages"</strong>) 
								on our web site located at <a href="http://www.Site59.com">http://www.Site59.com</a> 
								(the <strong>"Site"</strong>). Because the success of Site59 
								is dependent on building and maintaining goodwill 
								with our customers, we are committed to implementing 
								measures designed to protect the privacy of those 
								using the Site and the services provided on the 
								Site (<strong>"Services"</strong>).</p>
							<p>Although we respect the privacy of all those who 
								visit our Site and use our Services, we collect 
								information from our visitors and customers. This 
								Privacy Policy governs your interaction with the 
								Site, your purchase of Packages and use of the 
								Services, and your receipt of Site59's email newsletter. 
								Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy 
								and our <a href="tos.html">Terms of Service</a> 
								and other published guidelines, we do not release 
								personally identifiable information you provide 
								us. (Personally identifiable information includes 
								information that can be linked to a specific individual, 
								such as name, address, phone number, e-mail address 
								and, when applicable, credit card information.)</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>This Privacy Policy covers the following areas:</p>
								<ul type="disc">
									<li>What information we gather through the 
										Site</li>
									<li>How we use (and do not use) such information</li>
									<li>How you can change or delete your personal 
										information</li>
									<li>Information about safeguards in place 
										to protect your information</li>
									<li>Other important matters regarding your 
										privacy</li>
								</ul>
							</blockquote>
							<p>Please note that we review our privacy practices 
								from time to time, and that those practices are, 
								therefore, subject to change. We ask that you 
								bookmark and periodically review this page to 
								ensure continuing familiarity with the most current 
								version of our Privacy Policy. To contact us about privacy issues,
									to report a violation  of our Privacy Policy or to raise any
									other issue,	please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@site59.com">privacy@site59.com</a>.</p>
							<p><strong>The Information We Gather</strong></p>
							<p>When browsing the Site, you are not required to 
								provide any personally identifiable information, 
								such as your name, address, phone number or e-mail 
								address, unless and until such time as you choose 
								to make a purchase or sign up for an email newsletter, 
								as described below. We do not collect any personally 
								identifiable information from you unless you provide 
								it to us voluntarily. We do not knowingly collect 
								personally identifiable information from children 
								(meaning minors younger than thirteen years of 
								age). We do not knowingly permit the Site to be 
								used by any person under the age of eighteen (see 
								our <a href="tos.html">Terms of Service</a>), and we 
								require a valid credit card to make a purchase.</p>
							<p><em>Making a Purchase.</em> In order to purchase 
								a Package through the Site, you will have to provide 
								us with your name, your credit card number and 
								expiration date, your credit card billing address, 
								your telephone number, your email address, the 
								name or names of the person(s) traveling (if not 
								you). We may also ask you for other information, 
								such as your frequent traveler numbers. We require 
								this information so that we can process and fulfill 
								your order and keep you informed of your order's 
								status. If you are purchasing a Package for one 
								or more travelers other than yourself, you will 
								need to make sure that each of these other travelers 
								agrees, in advance, that you can disclose their 
								personally identifiable information to us.</p>
							<p><em>Receiving "Opt-in" Email Messages.</em> You may 
								choose to sign up for our departure city-specific 
								email, Site59 Top Picks, which contains news of 
								Site59 deals and discounts. In order to receive 
								the Site59 Top Picks email, you must provide us 
								with your first name, your email address, your 
								zip code and your preferred departure city.</p>
							<p><em>Automatic Logging of Session Data.</em> We do 
								automatically log generic information about your 
								computer's connection to the Internet, which we 
								call "session data", that is anonymous and not 
								linked to any personally identifiable information. 
								Session data consists of things such as your IP 
								address, operating system and browser software 
								and the activities conducted on the Site. Your 
								IP address is a number that lets computers attached 
								to the Internet, such as our web servers, know 
								where to send you data such as the pages of the 
								Site you wish to view. We collect session data 
								because it helps us analyze such thing as the 
								way visitors are clicking through the Site, how 
								many visitors are surfing to various pages on 
								the Site, how long visitors to the Site are staying 
								and how often they are visiting. It also helps 
								us diagnose problems with our servers and lets 
								us better administer our systems. Although such 
								information does not identify any visitor personally, 
								we can determine from an IP address a visitor's 
								Internet Service Provider and the geographic location 
								of his or her point of connectivity.</p>
							<p><em>Use of Cookies. </em> A "cookie" is a small text 
								file containing a unique string of numbers or 
								letters that is placed on an Internet users' computer. 
								One of the ways that we collect session data is 
								through the use of cookies. We also use cookies 
								to process the purchase of Packages through the 
								Site and for other technical reasons. Essentially, 
								cookies are a visitor's identification card for 
								the Site59 computers, or servers, that placed 
								them there. There are many myths circulating about 
								cookies, but you should know that cookies are 
								only read by the server that placed them, and 
								are unable to do such things as run programs on 
								your computer, plant viruses or harvest your personally 
								identifiable information. Cookies allow Site59 
								to serve you better and more efficiently, and 
								to personalize your experience at Site59's web 
								site. Of course, by changing the options on your 
								web browser or using certain software programs 
								you can control how and whether cookies will be 
								accepted by your web browser. However, doing so 
								may disable some features on the Site and make 
								it impossible to purchase Packages from us on 
								the Site. Please note that we do not currently 
								sell advertising of any kind on the Site, nor 
								do we currently have a relationship with a third 
								party ad server.</p>
							<p><em>Forums and Reviews.</em> We can not and do not 
								control the acts of our customers or visitors. 
								All customers and visitors should be aware that, 
								when they disclose personally identifiable information 
								in our reviews section or other forum on the Site, 
								the information may be collected and used by others 
								to send that person unsolicited email. In the 
								event that you encounter any person who you believe 
								is improperly collecting or using information 
								about you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@site59.com">privacy@site59.com</a>.</p>
							<p><strong>How We Use (and Do Not Use) the Information 
								We Gather</strong></p>
							<p>Please take some time to familiarize yourself with 
								the different ways we use the information that 
								we gather. In certain cases we employ other companies 
								and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. 
								Examples include delivering packages, sending 
								postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information 
								from customer lists, analyzing data, providing 
								marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, 
								and providing customer service. Each of these 
								has access to the personally identifiable information 
								necessary to perform their functions, but they 
								are not permitted to use it for other purposes. 
								Keep in mind, however, that we cannot and do not 
								assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions 
								of third parties, including the manner in which 
								they use information received either from us or 
								independently. Nevertheless, in the event that 
								you encounter any third party associated with, 
								or who claims association with, Site59 who you 
								believe is improperly collecting or using information 
								about you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@site59.com">privacy@site59.com</a>; 
								we will be happy to forward your message to the 
								third party.</p>
							<p><em>Personally Identifiable Information.</em> When 
								you purchase a Package through the Site, we communicate 
								with the relevant airline, hotel, car rental company, 
								entertainment venue, restaurant, or other supplier(s) 
								of such goods or services (each, a <strong>"Supplier"</strong>) 
								to book and pay for each element of your Package. 
								We provide such Suppliers with the personally 
								identifiable information you provided to us which 
								is necessary to book and fulfill your order. Ordinarily, 
								we do not need to disclose your credit card number 
								and expiration date to such Suppliers, since we 
								forward payment to them ourselves. We book many 
								elements of our Packages through Worldspan, the 
								leading processor of Internet travel bookings 
								worldwide, and therefore must provide certain 
								of your personally identifiable information to 
								them as well for this purpose. We also use your 
								personally identifiable information to communicate 
								with you, if necessary, during the booking and 
								fulfillment process, and to send you an email 
								to confirm the booking of your Package.</p>
							<p>Also, if you sign up to receive our Site59 Top 
								Picks newsletter, we use the personally identifiable 
								information that you provided at sign up to personalize 
								the email that we send you. Such emails typically 
								are sent on a weekly basis, and they, among other 
								things, will clearly provide you with a method 
								of unsubscribing, if you decide you no longer 
								wish to receive them. In addition, we may on occasion 
								send you an email when we have an important announcement 
								to make or policy change to inform you of.</p>
							<p><em>Non-personally Identifiable Information.</em> 
								We use non-personally identifiable information 
								in aggregate form to build higher quality, more 
								useful online services by performing statistical 
								analyses of the collective characteristics and 
								behavior of our customers and visitors, and by 
								measuring demographics and interests regarding 
								specific areas of the Site. We provide statistical 
								information based on this data to Suppliers, advertisers, 
								affiliates and other current and potential business 
								partners. We may also use the aggregate data to 
								inform these third parties as to the number of 
								people who have seen and clicked on links to their 
								web sites.</p>
							<p><strong>Changing or Deleting Personal Information</strong></p>
							<p>We retain your personally identifiable information 
								indefinitely, together with the details of the 
								Packages you have purchased through us, so that 
								we can provide you with meaningful customer service. 
								Once your trip is completed and paid for, however, 
								we purge your credit card information from our 
								database. If at any time you would like to have 
								the rest of your personally identifiable information 
								removed from Site59's database, please contact 
								us at <a href="mailto:privacy@site59.com">privacy@site59.com</a> 
								and we will use reasonable efforts to comply with 
								your request. Keep in mind, however, that there 
								will be residual information that will remain 
								within our databases, access logs and other records, 
								which may or may not contain such personally identifiable 
								information. The residual information will not 
								be used for commercial purposes; however, we reserve 
								the right, from time to time, to recontact former 
								customers of Site59.</p>
							<p><strong>Safeguards to Protect your Information</strong></p>
							<p>We take reasonable precautions to protect our customers' 
								information from unauthorized third parties. When 
								you are prompted by the Site to enter sensitive 
								information (such as your credit card number), 
								that information is encrypted with the industry-standard 
								encryption technology known as Secure Socket Layer 
								(SSL). While on a secure page, the lock icon on 
								the bottom of web browsers such as Microsoft Internet 
								Explorer or Netscape Navigator becomes locked, 
								as opposed to un-locked, when you are just 'surfing'. 
								In addition, the servers on which we store personally 
								identifiable information are kept in a secure 
								environment. However, no method of encryption 
								or security system is impenetrable. We cannot 
								guarantee the security of our servers, nor can 
								we guarantee that information that customers supply 
								will not be intercepted while being transmitted 
								over the Internet.</p>
							<p><strong>Other Important Matters Regarding your Privacy</strong></p>
							<p><em>Links to Other Web Sites.</em> The Site contains 
								links to other Internet web sites, including affiliated 
								web sites that may or may not be owned or operated 
								by us. We can not and do not review all of the 
								web sites that are linked to the Site, and we 
								have no control over such sites. Unless otherwise 
								explicitly stated, we are not responsible for 
								the privacy or other practices of such sites, 
								and the fact that we offer such links does not 
								indicate any approval or endorsement of any material 
								contained on any linked site. We are providing 
								these links to you only as a convenience. Accordingly, 
								we strongly encourage you to become familiar with 
								the terms of use and practices of any linked site.</p>
							<p><em>Private Label and Co-branded Web Sites.</em> 
								Whenever you are on the Site, this privacy policy 
								applies. However, we sometimes build, host and 
								operate web sites for other companies in the travel 
								or travel services area or other third parties 
								<strong>("Partners")</strong> on or through which we provide 
								our Packages to such Partners' customers and visitors. 
								You will know such web sites by the fact that 
								they either retain the logos, trademarks and style 
								of our PartnerÂ¡s web site, or they use both our 
								PartnerÂ¡s and our logos, trademarks and style 
								as a result of a co-branding arrangement. In most 
								of these cases, the sales we are consummating, 
								and any information we collect from our Partner's 
								customers or visitors during such sale, is collected 
								for our Partner on their behalf and for their 
								benefit. The collection, use and distribution 
								of such information is governed by such Partner's 
								privacy policy and not ours. In other less frequent 
								cases, we may have an agreement to share the information 
								we collect with our Partner on or through our 
								PartnersÂ¡ web site; in such cases each party's 
								privacy policies applies to their respective use 
								of such information. In any case, we take reasonable 
								steps to make clear to customers and visitors 
								to such Partner web sites which privacy policy 
								or policies are applicable to the collection, 
								use and distribution of information on such Partner 
								web sites and we provide a link to such privacy 
								policy or policies in each place any personally 
								identifiable information is collected. </p>
							<p><em>Promotions and Sweepstakes.</em> If and when 
								we sponsor promotions or sweepstakes, or third 
								parties sponsor promotions or sweepstakes in conjunction 
								with us, either we or the third party will post 
								relevant privacy information in the official rules 
								and/or registration area for the promotion or 
								sweepstakes. That privacy information, to the 
								extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, 
								will govern that particular promotion or sweepstakes.</p>
							<p><em>Other Permitted Release of Information.</em> 
								Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy 
								to the contrary, we reserve the right to release 
								information contained within our access logs concerning 
								any visitor or customer when that visitor or customer 
								is in violation of our <a href="tos.html">Terms 
								of Service</a> or other published guidelines, 
								or engages (or is reasonably suspected of engaging) 
								in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, 
								warrant or other court order, and to release such 
								information in response to court and governmental 
								orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests and 
								as otherwise required by law. We cooperate with 
								law enforcement agencies in identifying those 
								who may be using our servers or services for illegal 
								activities. We also reserve the right to report 
								any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement 
								individuals or entities for investigation or prosecution. 
								Please note that if we receive a formal request 
								to disclose your personally identifiable information 
								in connection with legal action, we will attempt 
								to tell you about it before we respond to such 
								request, if permitted by law, via the email address 
								you provided to us. In addition, if Site59 or 
								substantially all of its assets are acquired, 
								our customer information will most likely also 
								be transferred in connection with such acquisition.</p>
