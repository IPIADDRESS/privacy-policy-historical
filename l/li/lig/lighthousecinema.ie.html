To try and bring you offers that are of interest to you, Lighthouse Cinema or its service providers place ads on our webpages. As a result of your visit to our site, or by clicking on these ads, we may collect passive information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information.<br><br>

<h4 style="color:#444;">Your Consent</h4>
<br>
Consent to the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information may be given in various ways. Consent may be express (e.g. orally, electronically or on a form you may sign describing the intended uses and disclosures of Personal Information) or implied (e.g. when you provide information necessary for a service you have requested (such as providing us with your name, phone number and/or email for use by our lost and found services), or in some circumstances where notice has been provided to you about our intentions with respect to your Personal Information and you have not withdrawn your consent for an identified purpose, such as by using an "opt-out" option. Consent may be given by your authorized representative (such as a legal guardian, person having a power of attorney or a mandatary). By providing us with Personal Information, we will deem you to understand this Privacy Policy, and we will deem you to consent to our collection, use and disclosure of such Personal Information for the purposes identified or described in this Privacy Policy, if applicable, or otherwise at the time of collection. You may withdraw your consent to our collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information at any time, subject to contractual and legal restrictions and reasonable notice. Note that if you withdraw your consent to certain uses of your Personal Information, we may no longer be able to provide you with certain of our products or services.<br><br>

Lighthouse Cinema does not disclose your Personal Information except: (i) as permitted by this Privacy Policy; (ii) for which you are deemed to consent under the terms of this Privacy Policy; and/or (iii) as permitted or required by law. However, Lighthouse Cinema may be required or permitted under statute, regulation or as otherwise at law or in equity to collect, use or disclose Personal Information without your consent (for example, in response to a court order or subpoena, or to comply with local or federal regulations, or to collect a debt owed to us).<br><br>

<h4 style="color:#444;">Security</h4>
<br>
We protect your Personal Information using physical, electronic or procedural security measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the information in our custody or control, including safeguards to protect Personal Information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. Lighthouse Cinema and its employees, servants, agents, contractors, legal, accounting or other service providers, partners, representatives and mandataries who require access to your Personal Information in order to fulfill their job requirements will have access to your Personal Information. You transmit or provide all Personal Information entirely at your own risk.<br><br>

<h4 style="color:#444;">Consent to Transfer</h4>
<br>
Lighthouse Cinema's Website is operated on equipment located in Canada. If you are located in the United States of America, European Union or elsewhere outside Canada, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to Canada. By visiting www.lighthousecinema.ie, purchasing our products or services, participating in our online community and/or providing us with your Personal Information, you consent to this transfer. Regardless of your location, we shall protect your Personal Information using physical, electronic or procedural security measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the information in our custody or control, including safeguards to protect Personal Information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. Please note that the Personal Information which you provide to us will be held and used in accordance with such Canadian federal or provincial laws as exist from time to time, and as are applicable.<br><br>

<h4 style="color:#444;">Note to Parents/Children's Privacy</h4>
<br>
Protecting children's privacy is important to us. For that reason, we do not collect information on our website from those children we actually know are under 13 years of age. In addition, no part of our website is targeted to attract anyone under 13 years of age. We request that children under 13 years of age do not disclose or provide any Personal Information. If we discover such information, we will delete the child's Personal Information from our records. If for any reason we believe a user may be under the age of 13 we reserve the right to request proof of age of such user. If such proof is not provided, or if it is discovered a user is under the age of 13 all Personal Information of that user shall be deleted from our servers and associated systems and we reserve the right to limit and/or ban such user from our Website. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lighthouse Cinema may from time to time conduct, sponsor, co-sponsor or participate in contests and/or promotions which may be open to entrants of all ages, including children under the age of 13. During such contests and/or promotions Lighthouse Cinema makes special efforts to encourage children to consult with their parents before providing Personal Information and in each case parental consent must be obtained in order for any such entry or participation to be valid. Lighthouse Cinema also believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools, available from online services and software manufacturers, to help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools may also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other Personal Information without parental permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please visit http://www.icra.org/_en/parents<br><br>

<h4 style="color:#444;">Policy Changes</h4>
<br>
This Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time as Lighthouse Cinema deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion. If we materially change our privacy practices, we shall notify you of such changes on our Website; if necessary, we shall also update our Privacy Policy as it appears on our Website. If our information practices change such that your privacy may be materially affected, we shall notify you of such changes on our Website; if necessary, we shall also update our Privacy Policy as it appears on our Website. You will continue to have the ability to opt out of new non-essential uses or disclosures. If you are concerned with how your Personal Information is used, we encourage you to bookmark this site and to periodically review our Privacy Policy, or contact us as described below to obtain a current copy of our Privacy Policy.<br><br>

<h4 style="color:#444;">Access, Correction and Contacting Us</h4>
