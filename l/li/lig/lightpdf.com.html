This policy covers the processing of personal data by LightPDF, which is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information whilst striving to provide the very best user experience. We want our websites to be safe and enjoyable for everyone.</p><p>The operations of LightPDF are in accordance with the European Union's <strong>General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (GDPR), effective May 25, 2018. LightPDF has made the GDPR a priority, and we are and have always been fully aligned with the regulation's intended result: the protection of your privacy and personal data.</p><h2>1. What data do we collect and how do we use it?</h2><ul><li><strong>Information you provide to us</strong>. When you participate in, access, purchase or sign up to any of our services, activities or online content, such as subscriptions, newsletters, surveys, competitions or events, we receive personal information about you which we use to be able to provide these services.

We collect, and associate with your account, the information you provide to us when you do activities such as signing up for your account or making purchases for our Services (like your full name, email address, and billing address).</li><li><strong>Usage information</strong>. We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take when using our Services (like editing, viewing, and sharing Your Stuff, changing themes, activating software license, and logging in and out of your account).

You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.</li><li><strong>Uploaded Files</strong>. Some of our online/desktop applications provide free web hosting service for you. If you want, you may upload the files generated by these applications to the cloud server of our company and access them at any time as you want.
