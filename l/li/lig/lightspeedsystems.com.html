<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> YOUR DATA: How we collect and use information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information about Schools:</strong>When a School administrator registers a School with Lightspeed Systems, Inc. or corresponds with us online, we ask for certain information including a contact name, school name, school district, school email address and/or account name, phone number, message content, and information relating to the School’s information systems. We may also retain information provided by a School if the School sends us a message, posts content to our website or through our Service, or responds to emails or surveys. Once a School begins using a Lightspeed Systems, Inc. Service, we will keep records of activities related to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of the Service. Including customer service, support, and billing; to analyze our Service offerings and functionality; to communicate with our Schools and website visitors; to exchange information, and to offer related services such as user group membership and event registration.</p>
<p><strong>Student Data:</strong>Lightspeed Systems, Inc. may have access to personally identifiable information about students (“Student Data”) in the course of providing its Services to a School. We recognize Student Data is confidential and do not use such data for any purpose other than to provide the Services on the School’s behalf. In most instances, Lightspeed Systems, Inc. receives Student Data only from the School and never interacts with the Student directly. In some instances, depending on the type of Service used by the School, the Schools may allow Students to interact with a Lightspeed Systems, Inc. Service. In that instance, the School provides each student with login credentials and confirms that it has obtained appropriate parental consents, as needed before the student is permitted to access the Service. Lightspeed Systems, Inc. has access to Student Data only as requested by the School and only for the purposes of performing Services on the School’s behalf.</p>
<p>We may collect the following types of personally identifiable information directly from children: first name, last name, email address, password, IP address, grade level, and school. We may also generate a login ID for the child that is different than the child’s actual name or under the School’s direction, collect login/authentication data via a student information system identification number or other system designated by Customer.</p>
<p>Parents should consult the school’s Acceptable/Responsible Use, Social Media, Personnel, and Instructional Policies for more information about the school’s policies and practices for protecting children on the Internet. Teachers are reminded to also be aware of their obligations under the Ethical Standards for educators in their state and to be conscious of their role as a model for students while interacting with students using Lightspeed Systems, Inc. Services.</p>
<p>See “Student Safety” below for further explanation of our commitment to online student safety.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information from visitors to our sites and users of our Services, such as the date and time of their visit, the type of browser used (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system used (e.g., Windows 7 or Mac OS), the ISP from which the visitor receives Internet access, and aggregate information regarding what pages users of the site access or visit. We may collect data for Schools to monitor and generate reports of their users’ online search queries, websites visited or blocked from visiting recorded web activity, and device geolocation for purpose of asset recovery. In addition, we may monitor Schools’ onboarding tasks completed, search queries on our sites, number of users’ sessions on our websites, city and state/province where last accessing our Services, responses to our survey questions, and content provided on managed devices via customizable fields.</p>
<p>We may also match non-personally identifiable information from registered members with personally identifiable information (such as the member’s name) in our database to track deployment progress, troubleshoot Services issues, analyze usage, and otherwise monitor Services to make improvements.</p>
<p>Lightspeed Systems, Inc. and its third-party service providers use cookies (both session and persistent cookies) and other tracking mechanisms to automatically collect information including IP addresses, session sources, and other data which tracks users’ access to the Services. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third-party service providers may do so on our behalf).</p>
<p><strong>Employment Applications: </strong>In connection with a job application or inquiry, we may collect data about you, including your educational background, résumé or curriculum vitae, and other information, including your ethnicity or criminal background information where required or permitted by law. We may use this information throughout Lightspeed Systems for the purpose of employment consideration. We will keep the information for future consideration unless you direct us not to do so.</p>
