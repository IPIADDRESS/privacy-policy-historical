              LightScribe uses your personal information to provide you with services

              we use your information to communicate with you, to provide service

              (see section 7, "Your privacy preferences and opting out").<br>
              Personal data collected online may also be combined with information 
              you provide LightScribe through other sources such as product registration, 
              call centers or public events such as trade shows or seminars.<br>

              LightScribe contracts with third-party service providers and suppliers 
              to deliver complete products, services and customer solutions described

              on behalf of LightScribe and may not use it for any purpose other 
              than to carry out the services they are performing for LightScribe. 
              These service providers may change or we may contract with additional 
              service providers to better accommodate our customers. LightScribe 
              will not share personal information with any other third parties 
              without your permission, unless required by law enforcement action, 
              subpoena, or local law. <br>
              LightScribe or its related entities could merge with or be acquired 
              by another business entity or some or all of their respective assets 
              could be acquired. If such a combination or acquisition occurs, 
              LightScribe will make every reasonable effort to notify you in the 
              event we share with the merging or acquiring entity some or all

              To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable 
              steps to verify your identity, such as a password and user ID, before

              We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or

              other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned
