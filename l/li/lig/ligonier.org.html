			<h4>Privacy Statement</h4>
		
			<p>Ligonier Ministries is committed to respecting the privacy rights of all visitors to our web site.  The following outlines our privacy policy and details the measures we have taken to safeguard and protect your privacy.  Information you provide to us is understood to be in agreement with the policies detailed below.</p> 

			<h4>What information does Ligonier Ministries collect?</h4>

			<p>Ligonier Ministries collects and stores your personal information when you create an account, sign up to receive our e-newsletter, or sign our guest book.  When creating an account, we ask you for your first and last name, your mailing address, e-mail address, and phone number.  If you are placing an order or making a contribution we will also ask you for payment information and, if applicable, shipping method.</p> 

			<p>Our system may also gather information about the areas you visit on our site as well as the IP address you use to connect to our site.  We would use this information internally only for these reasons: 1) to personalize your experience on ligonier.org and 2) to prevent fraudulent activity on your account.  We will not share any of this information on an individual basis (we may share it in aggregate form without personal identifiers).   Occasionally, we may employ consultants or service providers of Ligonier Ministries who will assist us in serving you better.  We will only share your information with a consultant or service provider if the party agrees to protect your private information by adopting a privacy policy at least as stringent as our own.  We do use navigational information both in the aggregate and on an individual basis to understand how our visitors use ligonier.org so that we can make periodic improvements to our site.  We do not keep track of where you go on the World Wide Web.</p> 

			<h4>What does Ligonier Ministries do with your personal information?</h4>
			
			<p>Your information is used to process orders and accept gifts.  By storing your personal information on a secure server, Ligonier Ministries is able to shorten your checkout process and allow you to check the status of your orders online.</p>

			<h4>Does Ligonier Ministries share any personal information it collects with outside parties?</h4>

			<p>Ligonier Ministries does not sell or share any personal information.</p>

			<h4>Does Ligonier Ministries safeguard my personal information?</h4>

			<p>Ligonier Ministries has implemented a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information.  Your personal information is contained behind a secure network and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights.  When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server.  All sensitive/credit information supplied by you is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and securely stored.</p>
			
			<h4>Does Ligonier Ministries provide a way to update or remove my personal information?</h4>
			
			<p>Ligonier Ministries provides a "Profile" feature on our web site that allows you to modify and/or remove most of your personal information.  This page can be accessed by clicking on the "Profile" button on the "Online Store" page.  All of your information within your profile is secure and accessible only by you or limited personnel.</p>

			<h4>How does Ligonier Ministries use my e-mail address?</h4>
			
			<p>Your e-mail address is used to create and identify your account on ligonier.org.  Your e-mail address is also used by Ligonier Ministries to correspond with you about orders you may have placed or to keep you updated if you opt in to receive e-mails from us.  We may also use your e-mail address to notify you about important functionality changes to the web site.  If you would rather not receive this information or would like to opt-out of receiving e-mail of this kind, simply click on the "Unsubscribe" link that appears on the bottom of any e-mail from ligonier.org and follow the simple instructions to have your e-mail address removed from the list of those who receive updates, e-newsletters, announcements, or notices of new functionality or services.</p>

			<h4>Does Ligonier Ministries use "cookies"?</h4>
			
			<p>Yes.  A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web site that may be saved on your hard disk by your computer's browser.  The cookie holds information a site may need to personalize your experience and to gather statistical data, such as which pages are visited, the Internet provider's domain name and the country of origin from which our visitors come from (e.g., "aol.com" or "msn.com"), and the addresses of the sites visited immediately before coming to  and immediately after leaving ligonier.org.  However, none of this information is associated with you as an individual.  It is measured anonymously and only in the aggregate.  The information in the cookies allows us to trace your "clickstream" activity (i.e., the path taken by visitors to our site as they move from page to page).  Cookies do not capture your individual e-mail address or private information about you.</p>
			
			<p>To browse without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is set.  Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.  Even if you choose to browse without cookies, you can still access most of the features on ligonier.org.</p>
			
			<h4>How can I remove my name from Ligonier Ministries' direct mail or e-mail list?</h4>
			
			<p>To have your e-mail address removed from our list of addresses that receive information about new products, services, sales, and promotions, simply click on the "Unsubscribe" link that appears at the bottom of any e-mail you've received from us and follow the simple instructions.  You may remove your personal information from our direct mail list by contacting us in writing at: Ligonier Ministries, 400 Technology Park, Lake Mary, FL 32746 on the World Wide Web at <a href="mailto:customerservice@ligonier.org">customerservice@ligonier.org</a>, or by calling 800.435.4343.</p>
			
			<h4>Your Consent</h4>
			
			<p>You acknowledge that this privacy policy is part of the terms of service and you agree that using this site signifies your assent to Ligonier Ministries' privacy policy.  Ligonier Ministries reserves the right to change the terms of service, including this privacy policy at any time, without advanced notice.  If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post the changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
			
			<h4>Tell us what you think</h4>
			
			<p>If you have any comments or questions about this privacy statement, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@ligonier.org">webmaster@ligonier.org</a> or refer to our contact information to reach us by phone or postal mail.</p>
