						<p>By using, accessing or participating in the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy<br>
Policy. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings set forth<br>
in the Terms of Use (located at <a title="Terms of Use" href="http://liquidspace.com/terms/">http://liquidspace.com/terms/</a>). We reserve the right<br>
to change our Privacy Policy at any time. If we do this, we will post a notice that we<br>
have made changes to this Privacy Policy on the Site for at least 7 days after the changes<br>
are posted and will indicate at the bottom of the Privacy Policy the date these terms were<br>
last revised. Any revisions to this Privacy Policy will become effective the earlier of (i)<br>
the end of the foregoing 7-day period or (ii) the first time you access or use the Service<br>
after any such changes. If you do not agree to abide by this or any future Privacy Policy,<br>
do not use, access or participate in (or continue to use, access or participate in) the<br>
Service.</p>
<div class="privacy_headings">
<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
</div>
<p>When you use the Service you provide us with two types of information: (i) information<br>
you submit via the Service and (ii) information regarding your use of the Service<br>
collected by us as you interact with the Service.</p>
<p>When you enter the Site, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information<br>
is gathered for all LiquidSpace visitors. In addition, we store certain information from<br>
your browser using “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer<br>
tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are<br>
logged in. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a<br>
simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature;<br>
however, you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you certain features<br>
(e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the Site.</p>
<p>Through the registration process you may provide us with your name, company<br>
affiliation, email address, telephone number, physical address, and other information that<br>
may be requested during the registration process on the Site. If you wish to create an<br>
account that requires payment of a fee, or use services offered via the Site that require<br>
payment of a fee, a valid credit card number or other payment information may be<br>
required. By submitting your payment information, you authorize LiquidSpace to access<br>
and use this information in order to provide you with and accept payment for the Service.</p>
<p>When you use the Service you may submit information and content to your Profile, send<br>
messages, perform searches, submit reviews, and otherwise transmit information to other<br>
Users. We store this information so that we can provide you the service and offer<br>
personalized features.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures<br>
contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies<br>
of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users<br>
have copied or stored your User Content.</p>
<p>If you use the Mobile Software, your location may be tracked on the mobile device on<br>
which the Mobile Software is installed. LiquidSpace will not collect, transmit or<br>
otherwise use this information without your permission. As a Member, you can control<br>
when Venue Owners or other Members can see your location through your privacy<br>
settings.</p>
<div class="privacy_headings">
<h2>Minors</h2>
</div>
<p>LiquidSpace does not knowingly collect or solicit information from anyone under the age<br>
of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 18, please do not<br>
attempt to register for LiquidSpace or send any information about you to us, including<br>
your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 18 may<br>
provide any information to or on LiquidSpace. If you believe that we might have any<br>
information from or about a minor under 18, please contact us at<br>
<span id="privcy_links"><a href="mailto:privacy@liquidspace.com">privacy@liquidspace.com</a></span>.</p>
<div class="privacy_headings">
<h2>Use of Information Obtained by LiquidSpace</h2>
</div>
<p>Once you register with LiquidSpace, you may create your Profile. Your Profile<br>
information, as well as your contact information, are displayed to other Users. We may<br>
occasionally use your contact information to send you notifications regarding new<br>
services offered by LiquidSpace and its partners that we think you may find valuable.<br>
LiquidSpace may also send you service-related announcements from time to time through<br>
the general operation of the Service. Generally, you may opt out of such emails, although<br>
LiquidSpace reserves the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out<br>
of all voluntary email notifications.</p>
<p>Profile information is used by LiquidSpace primarily to be presented back to and edited<br>
by you when you access the Service and to be presented to others. In some cases, other<br>
Users may be able to supplement your Profile, including by submitting comments and<br>
reviews. Information from your Profile may be available to third party search engines.<br>
This is primarily so that potential users may be able to find you.</p>
<p>LiquidSpace may use aggregate data (based partly on IP addresses) collected through the<br>
Service to analyze Service usage and system performance. This data may be used by<br>
LiquidSpace and shared with third parties in any manner.</p>
<div class="privacy_headings">
<h2>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h2>
</div>
<p>You may choose to provide information about you, your company or organization or, if<br>
you are a Venue Owner, your Venue to other Users and to the public by providing such<br>
information on public areas of the Site (“Public Information”). Public Information<br>
consists of information that is posted by you on areas of the Site accessible by other<br>
Users and/or the public, such as Venue descriptions. Public information does not include<br>
information you submit to Us but do not post on areas of the Site accessible by other Users and/or the public, such as billing and payment information (“Non-Public<br>
Information”).</p>
<p>We share your Non-Public Information with third parties only in limited circumstances<br>
where we believe such sharing is reasonably necessary to offer the Service, legally<br>
required or, permitted by you. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may provide Non-Public Information to service providers who help us bring<br>
you the services we offer, such as hosting the service at a co-location facility,<br>
sending email updates about LiquidSpace, removing repetitive information from<br>
our User lists, processing payments, or to provide search results or links. In<br>
connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers<br>
may have access to your Non-Public Information for use for a limited time in<br>
connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the<br>
processing of any of your Non-Public Information, we implement reasonable<br>
contractual protections limiting the use of that Non-Public Information to the<br>
provision of services to LiquidSpace.</li>
<li>We may be required to disclose Non-Public Information pursuant to lawful<br>
requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable<br>
laws. Additionally, we may share account or other Non-Public Information when<br>
we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property,<br>
to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Service or using<br>
the LiquidSpace name, or to prevent imminent harm. This may include sharing<br>
Non-Public Information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government<br>
agencies.</li>
<li>We may offer to provide services jointly with other companies on the Service, and<br>
we may share Non-Public Information with that company in connection with such<br>
offer or your use of that service.</li>
<li>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the LiquidSpace business, or<br>
individual business units or assets owned by LiquidSpace that are related to the<br>
Site, were to change, your Non-Public Information may be transferred to the new<br>
owner. In any such transfer of information, your Non-Public Information would<br>
remain subject to this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you use the Service, certain information you post or share with third parties<br>
(including other Users), such as comments, reviews or other information, may be shared<br>
with other Users in accordance with the privacy settings you select. All such sharing of<br>
information is done at your own risk. Please keep in mind that if you disclose confidential<br>
information in your Profile or when posting comments, reviews or other submissions, this<br>
information may become publicly available.</p>
<p>Your posting of Public Information to public areas of the Site constitutes your consent to<br>
share such Public Information publicly. Please be aware that Public Information will be<br>
accessible by both Users and the general public. Nothing in this Privacy Policy shall<br>
restrict LiquidSpace’s right to use Public Information.</p>
<div class="privacy_headings">
<h2>Links</h2>
</div>
<p>LiquidSpace may contain links to other websites. We are of not responsible for the<br>
privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage Users to be aware when they leave the<br>
Site to read the privacy statements of other web sites that collect personally identifiable<br>
information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by LiquidSpace<br>
via the Site.</p>
<div class="privacy_headings">
<h2>Third Party Advertising</h2>
</div>
<p>Advertisements that appear on LiquidSpace are sometimes delivered (or “served”)<br>
directly to Users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address<br>
when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your<br>
computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and “web beacons” (also known<br>
as “1×1 gifs”) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising<br>
content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time<br>
they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to<br>
personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where<br>
individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine<br>
which advertisements are clicked. LiquidSpace does not have access to or control of the<br>
cookies or other technologies that may be used by the third party advertisers. Third party<br>
advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on LiquidSpace unless you<br>
choose to share it with them.</p>
<p>This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by LiquidSpace and does not cover the use<br>
of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.</p>
<div class="privacy_headings">
<h2>Changing or Removing Information</h2>
</div>
<p>Users may modify or delete their Profile information by logging into their account.<br>
Removed information may persist in backup copies but will not be generally available to<br>
other Users. Where you make use of the communication features of the service to share<br>
information with other Users (e.g., sending a message to another User) you generally<br>
cannot remove such communications from the Site.</p>
<div class="privacy_headings">
<h2>Security</h2>
</div>
<p>LiquidSpace takes reasonable precautions to protect Users’ Non-Public Information.<br>
Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. Because email<br>
and instant messaging are not secure communications, we cannot guarantee the security<br>
of any private information sent to us by email or instant messaging services.</p>
<div class="privacy_headings">
<h2>Data Transfer</h2>
</div>
<p>By using the Service, you are consenting to have the data you submit to or through the<br>
Service transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>
<div class="privacy_headings">
<h2>Contacting LiquidSpace</h2>
</div>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or LiquidSpace’s privacy practices in<br>
general, please contact us at:</p>
