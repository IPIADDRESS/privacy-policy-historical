                        <p>
When you enter the Site, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is
gathered for all LiquidSpace visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your
browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to
information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in.
If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple
procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature;
however, you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you certain features
(e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the Site.
                        </p>
                        <p>Through the registration process you may provide us with your name, company
affiliation, email address, telephone number, physical address, and other information that
may be requested during the registration process on the Site. If you wish to create an
account that requires payment of a fee, or use services offered via the Site that require
payment of a fee, a valid credit card number or other payment information may be
required. By submitting your payment information, you authorize LiquidSpace to access
and use this information in order to provide you with and accept payment for the Service.

Users. We store this information so that we can provide you the service and offer
personalized features.</p>

                      <p>We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures

                       <p>LiquidSpace does not knowingly collect or solicit information from anyone under the age
of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 18, please do not
attempt to register for LiquidSpace or send any information about you to us, including
your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 18 may
provide any information to or on LiquidSpace. If you believe that we might have any
information from or about a minor under 18, please contact us at

                       <p>Once you register with LiquidSpace, you may create your Profile. Your Profile
information, as well as your contact information, are displayed to other Users. We may
occasionally use your contact information to send you notifications regarding new
services offered by LiquidSpace and its partners that we think you may find valuable.
LiquidSpace may also send you service-related announcements from time to time through
the general operation of the Service. Generally, you may opt out of such emails, although
LiquidSpace reserves the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out
of all voluntary email notifications.</p>
                   
                       <p>Profile information is used by LiquidSpace primarily to be presented back to and edited
by you when you access the Service and to be presented to others. In some cases, other
Users may be able to supplement your Profile, including by submitting comments and
reviews. Information from your Profile may be available to third party search engines.
This is primarily so that potential users may be able to find you.</p>

                       <p>LiquidSpace may use aggregate data (based partly on IP addresses) collected through the
Service to analyze Service usage and system performance. This data may be used by
LiquidSpace and shared with third parties in any manner.</p>

                        <p>You may choose to provide information about you, your company or organization or, if
you are a Venue Owner, your Venue to other Users and to the public by providing such
information on public areas of the Site (“Public Information”). Public Information
consists of information that is posted by you on areas of the Site accessible by other
Users and/or the public, such as Venue descriptions. Public information does not include
information you submit to Us but do not post on areas of the Site accessible by other
Users and/or the public, such as billing and payment information (“Non-Public
Information”).</p>

                       <p>We share your Non-Public Information with third parties only in limited circumstances
where we believe such sharing is reasonably necessary to offer the Service, legally
required or, permitted by you. For example:</p>

                     <ul>
                     
                     <li><p>We may provide Non-Public Information to service providers who help us bring
you the services we offer, such as hosting the service at a co-location facility,
sending email updates about LiquidSpace, removing repetitive information from
our User lists, processing payments, or to provide search results or links. In
connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers
may have access to your Non-Public Information for use for a limited time in
connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the
processing of any of your Non-Public Information, we implement reasonable
contractual protections limiting the use of that Non-Public Information to the
provision of services to LiquidSpace.</p></li>

                     <li><p>We may be required to disclose Non-Public Information pursuant to lawful
requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable
laws. Additionally, we may share account or other Non-Public Information when
we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property,
to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Service or using
the LiquidSpace name, or to prevent imminent harm. This may include sharing
Non-Public Information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government
agencies.</p></li>

                     <li><p>We may offer to provide services jointly with other companies on the Service, and
we may share Non-Public Information with that company in connection with such
offer or your use of that service.</p></li>

                     <li><p>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the LiquidSpace business, or
individual business units or assets owned by LiquidSpace that are related to the
Site, were to change, your Non-Public Information may be transferred to the new
owner. In any such transfer of information, your Non-Public Information would
remain subject to this Privacy Policy.</p></li>

                                        
                     </ul>
                     
                     <p>When you use the Service, certain information you post or share with third parties
(including other Users), such as comments, reviews or other information, may be shared
with other Users in accordance with the privacy settings you select. All such sharing of
information is done at your own risk. Please keep in mind that if you disclose confidential
information in your Profile or when posting comments, reviews or other submissions, this
information may become publicly available.</p>
 
                     <p>Your posting of Public Information to public areas of the Site constitutes your consent to
share such Public Information publicly. Please be aware that Public Information will be
accessible by both Users and the general public. Nothing in this Privacy Policy shall
restrict LiquidSpace’s right to use Public Information.</p>
 
                     <div class="privacy_headings"><h2>Links</h2></div>
                     
                     <p>LiquidSpace may contain links to other websites. We are of not responsible for the
privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage Users to be aware when they leave the
Site to read the privacy statements of other web sites that collect personally identifiable
information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by LiquidSpace
via the Site.</p>

                     <div class="privacy_headings"><h2>Third Party Advertising</h2></div>
                     
                     <p>Advertisements that appear on LiquidSpace are sometimes delivered (or "served")
directly to Users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address
when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your
computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as
"1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising
content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time
they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to
personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where
individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine
which advertisements are clicked. LiquidSpace does not have access to or control of the
cookies or other technologies that may be used by the third party advertisers. Third party
advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on LiquidSpace unless you
choose to share it with them.</p>

                     <p>This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by LiquidSpace and does not cover the use
of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.</p>
                            
                                                                             
                     <div class="privacy_headings"><h2>Changing or Removing Information</h2></div>
                     
                     <p>Users may modify or delete their Profile information by logging into their account.
Removed information may persist in backup copies but will not be generally available to
other Users. Where you make use of the communication features of the service to share
information with other Users (e.g., sending a message to another User) you generally
cannot remove such communications from the Site.</p>      
  
                    <div class="privacy_headings"><h2>Security</h2></div>

                    <p>LiquidSpace takes reasonable precautions to protect Users' Non-Public Information.
Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. Because email
and instant messaging are not secure communications, we cannot guarantee the security
of any private information sent to us by email or instant messaging services.</p>
