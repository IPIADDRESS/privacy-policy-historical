However, in the event of circumstances beyond our control (e.g. changes in VAT, inflationary cost increases or currency fluctuations), they may have to be altered up or down. We will inform you of any change to price before you place your order.<br><br>

    <span class="subheader">Discounted offers</span><br>
 	Discounts offered for multiple buys cannot be used in conjunction with any other discounted offer. If you try to use two valid offers together, only the one that gives you the best discount will be applied.<br><br>

	We will repair or replace any item failing to give reasonable wear after purchase due to defective workmanship or materials, within a 12-month period â€“ or longer in some cases (see details with individual products) â€“ providing the item has been reasonably used.<br><br>
	All products are subject to availability. While every care is taken to state the correct sizes and specifications of all items, slight variations may occur within accepted trade tolerances and in exceptional circumstances, if any article is not available, we may send you a carefully selected substitute of equal or greater value.

If we discover such an error after you have submitted an order to us, we will contact you prior to accepting your order with the correct details. You may then either cancel your order or re-confirm it based on the correct information. If we are unable to contact you, we will treat your order as cancelled.<br><br>
	3.3 All prices shown on our website are inclusive of VAT.<br><br>

	<span class="subheader">4. Delivery</span><br>

	<strong>Credit Agreement and moneylending agreement regulated by the consumer credit act 1995</strong><br>
	This agreement is between us, Shop Direct Ireland Limited, whose registered office is Cape House, Westend Office Park, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15 (the creditor) and you.<br><br>
	
    <span class="subheader">Terms of Payment: How your account works</span><br>
	Repayments - You will be sent a statement every 28 days giving details of all transactions on your account during the period since your last statement or, if there has been no previous statement, since the opening of your account.  The first payment will become due 23 days after the date of your first statement and all subsequent payments will become due 23 days after the date of the statement on which they appear.  The due date will be shown on each statement.  You will be required to make at least the minimum payment by the due date shown on your statement.  The minimum payment on current balances over â‚¬100 will be 10% of that current balance, rounded down to the nearest â‚¬1.  The minimum payment on current balances of â‚¬100 or less will be â‚¬10 or the full current balance, if it is less than â‚¬10. You may pay more than the minimum payment if you wish to do so.<br><br>
	The annual percentage rate (APR) for this agreement is variable and is currently 32.77%. This is equivalent to a cost per â‚¬100 borrowed of â‚¬32.77.  We may vary the interest rate at our discretion at any time, and will notify you of the variation, but will not increase it above a maximum of 43.7% APR.  The current annual flat rate of interest is 28.577%.  Interest is charged on the daily current balance for the period covered by your statement at the simple daily variable rate of 0.07851% and is applied on each statement date.<br><br>
	The credit limit on your account will initially be the amount of your first purchase.  We may increase or decrease your credit limit from time to time to reflect factors such as changes in your personal status, shopping requirements or other characteristics and we will notify you of this.<br><br>
	You may charge as many purchases as you like to your account up to your current credit limit.  You must not exceed your credit limit. This agreement will continue until it is terminated by either us or you in accordance with clauses 12 or 13 below.<br><br>
	In addition to our rights to vary the credit limit and interest rates described above, we reserve the right to vary this agreement at any time to reflect changes in relevant laws, changes in our systems capabilities, changes in market conditions affecting our business and new developments in the market place. Where the change is material or is to a fundamental term of this agreement we will give you 28 days prior written notice of the change. You will have the opportunity to terminate this agreement under clause 12 if you are unhappy with the variation.<br><br>
	
	<span class="subheader">Cooling Off Period under the Consumer Credit Act 1995</span><br>
	You have a right to withdraw from this agreement without penalty if you give written notice to us at the address above, within 10 days from the date you are given a copy of this agreement.<br><br>
	You can choose not to exercise your right to this cooling off period by signing a separate statement to this effect.<br><br>

	<span class="subheader">Terms of the Agreement</span><br>

Once the Buy Now Pay Later transaction is charged to your account it will be shown as part of the current balance on which we calculate your minimum payments and interest charges. Any purchases will be taken into account in determining your remaining available credit, even though they may not yet have been charged to the account.<br><br>
	2. Acceleration of payment - You must pay at least the minimum payment due in full by the due date shown on your statement.  If you fail to do so, we have the right to send you a default notice in accordance with section 54 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995.

The outstanding balance for all purposes of this agreement will include all sums then due on the account, together with all payments due to be charged to your account at any time in the future under Buy Now Pay Later promotions.<br><br>
