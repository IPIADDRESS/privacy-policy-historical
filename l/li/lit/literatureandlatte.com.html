                <p>Literature &amp; Latte respect your privacy. The only data we collect is necessary for the features of our software or website to run properly. Wherever we can, we provide the ability to opt-out of features that ask for personal information. The information below provides an overview of the sorts of data our software and website uses.</p>

<h4>Who We Are</h4>

<p>We are Literature &amp; Latte Ltd, and our address is Lowin House, Tregolls Road, Truro, Cornwall, TR1 2NA, United Kingdom.</p>

<h4>Billing Information</h4>

<p>When you purchase software directly from us, your order information is processed by our third-party vendor, eSellerate (which is in turn owned by DigitalRiver -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.digitalriver.com/">www.digitalriver.com</a>). We do not store any of your purchasing information on our web server, and eSellerate does not store your payment details once the transaction has completed.&nbsp;What will be stored is your billing address, e-mail and the user name that you selected when filling out the purchase form. This is used for verification purposes, and so that we can retrieve your serial number should you ever lose it, using the eSellerate systems. Such information is automatically erased from the eSellerate systems after ten years. (<a href="http://cs.mycommerce.com/privacy-policy/esellerate/mcus">View eSellerate's privacy policy</a>.)</p>

<p>If you purchased our software from the one of Apple's App Stores, we have no access to data about your purchase:&nbsp;Apple manages your data and does not share any of it with us. (<a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/legal/privacy/en-ww/">View Apple's privacy policy</a>.)</p>

<h4>Internet Access</h4>

<p>Scrivener and Scapple for macOS and Windows will occasionally use your internet connection to check our site for updates. (On macOS, this only applies if purchased from our store—on the Mac App Store, updates are handled by Apple.) It does so by contacting www.literatureandlatte.com on a secure connection to check for new versions of the software. This is what allows Scrivener and Scapple&nbsp;to notify you that an update is available. This option can be turned off in the app's Preferences or settings. No information is sent to or stored on our web server during this process.</p>

<p>To activate versions of our software purchased from our store, it is necessary to activate the product over the internet. During this process, our software contacts&nbsp;the eSellerate servers (www.esellerate.net) to validate the licence against the information stored there. Additional validation checks are performed periodically, which also contact the eSellerate servers. These operations use your serial number and user name. No other personal data is sent.</p>

<h4 id="cookies">Cookies</h4>

<p>A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your&nbsp;computer to improve the browsing experience by remembering your preferences. Our website uses cookies in several ways.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Our website uses cookies to remember preferences such as which platform you were last viewing.</li>
	<li>If you use our forums, you will receive session cookies, or a permanent cookie if you choose to have the site remember your login information.</li>
	<li>Our blog will use a cookie to remember your login information (if you create an account so that you can post comments).</li>
	<li>Google Analytics is used to track usage of our site.</li>
	<li>AdRoll helps us figure out which promotions work best.</li>
	<li>Our web store may use cookies to remember which items are in your basket.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your browser will have an option to clear all cookies from your machine, and also to block all cookies should you so wish.</p>

<h4>Contacts Information on macOS</h4>

<p>Scrivener for macOS asks for access to your Contacts, which you are free to deny. If granted access, it only uses your personal Contact information to fill in your name and address on title pages. You can alternatively set this information in the Preferences or type it out yourself without needing to grant Scrivener access to your Contacts.</p>

<h4>Support and Contacting Us</h4>

<p>We use the&nbsp;<a href="http://tenderapp.com">Tenderapp</a>&nbsp;system to manage email and support requests. When you email us, your email and email address will stay in our support system, along with anything else you send, which enables us to keep track of the problem and refer to it should you need related help in the future. You can email us at any time to ask us to delete your information from our support system.</p>

<h4>Newsletter</h4>

<p>If you receive our occasional newsletter, it's either because you signed up for it in the Help menu in our software or on our site, or because you ticked the box saying that you were happy to hear from us when you made a purchase from our store. If so, we have the email address and name you provided stored so that we can email you updates. (We use Campaign Monitor for our newsletters.)&nbsp;You can unsubscribe&nbsp;at any time by following the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the newsletter.</p>

<h4>Data Protection</h4>

<p>We hate spam as much as anyone else, and we don't share any data we hold on our users with anyone else.</p>

<p>You have a right to access any data we hold about you, and we will deal with any subject access request within 30 days. Please contact <a href="mailto:data@literatureandlatte.com">data@literatureandlatte.com</a> or write to the Data Protection Officer, Literature &amp; Latte Ltd, Lowin House, Tregolls Road, Truro, TR1 2NA, marking your request “subject access request” and giving us your name, address and the email address you registered your software under.</p>

<p>If you have any complaints about your data and how this is held, you can contact us and we’ll do our utmost to get to the bottom of things. If, after contacting our Data Protection Officer you feel your complaint has not been dealt with satisfactorily, the supervisory authority for data protection in the UK is the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) which you can contact on 0303 123 1113 or via their website at <a href="http://ico.org.uk/">ico.org.uk</a>.</p>
