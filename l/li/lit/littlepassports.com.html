                                      <p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Non-personally identifiable information is information that, by itself, cannot be tracked to a specific individual.

                                      <p><strong>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information. </strong>We may use the non-personally identifiable information to generate user statistics that we may provide to prospective advertisers or partners, and that we may use to enhance your experience using and generally improve the Site. If we provide any such information to others, we will provide such information in the aggregate only and will not include any personally identifiable information about any individual users.  We may also use the non-personally identifiable information to generate statistics that we may provide to you and to other Users of the Site.  We also may provide non-personally identifiable information to contractors so that they can perform services related to the Site for us. </p>
                                      <p>We may use different types of technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information, including cookies and single-pixel GIFs.

                                      <p><strong>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Little Passports may use non-personally identifiable information collected to improve the quality of Little Passports' services; for example, by diagnosing service or technology problems, by assessing and maintaining security, by increasing ad placements on web sites that are generating more web traffic, by presenting you with information that we think you would be interested in seeing, or by allowing you to log in or access your profile information automatically. We may also use the information to count and recognize returning users. </p>
                                      <p>We may use non-personally identifiable information collected to determine user demographics, interests, and behavior and may market Little Passports products by sharing non-personally identifiable information with potential customers or partners. Little Passports also may provide your non-personally identifiable information to contractors so that they can perform services for us.

We may then share such aggregated non-personally identifiable information with prospective marketing partners, advertisers and others.</p>

                                      <p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”). </strong>PII is any piece of information that can be traced back to a specific individual user and so might be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate that specific individual.

                                      <h2>CHILD PROTECTION                                      </h2>
                                      <p>IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 13, Little Passports requires a parent's or guardian's permission before we will collect your personal information.  Registration on the site does not currently require you to provide any PII to the website, and so we may accept your registration on the website without your parent or guardian’s prior consent.  Even so, your parent or guardian may request that your account be removed from our system at any time.  Little Passports may not and will not require a child to disclose any more information than is necessary for such child’s participation in the activity that requires such information.</p>
                                      <h2>NOTE TO PARENTS                                      </h2>
                                      <p>The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to provide our visitors with information about our website, which we hope will promote informed choices and decisions about how to use the site, as well as protect our users' privacy. </p>
                                      <p>Little Passports recognizes that some younger visitors may not understand some of the information contained on our website or how the site operates. Please discuss this statement with your children so that they will better understand how to use the site and the information they may be asked to provide. </p>
                                      <p>Before collecting personal information from your child, we will send you an email to get your consent to our collection of such information.  We make every attempt to inform your children of this policy wherever this information is collected on the Website.  However, please note that we do not have the internal mechanisms to confirm the accuracy of the statements they provide to us.  We will never require a child to disclose any more information than is necessary to register and use the Site or the activity for which your child is registering. </p>
                                      <p>Currently, registration on the Site does not require your child to provide any PII to the website, and so we may accept your child’s registration on the website without your prior consent.  Nonetheless, you may request that your child’s account be removed from our system at any time.  Before we collect PII from a child under the age of 13, we will send an email to such user’s parents or guardian requesting their consent to our collection of PII from their child.  Parents and guardians will be given <strong>[48]</strong> hours to refuse such consent.  If the parent or guardian refuses to provide their consent, we will delete that child's information from our database.  If you do not respond within the requested time period, we will send a second follow-up email requesting your permission for your child to use the site.  We will not collect any additional information from your child without your consent. </p>
                                      <p>We will maintain your child’s user account in accordance with this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, and any applicable laws at all times. Please read our Terms of Service for more information on the content and materials that Little Passports allows to be posted on our websites.</p>
                                      <p>If your child’s information is deleted from our system and your child subsequently wishes to re-register on the system, your child will have to submit his or her information and you will have to give your consent pursuant to the procedures set forth above.</p>
                                      <p>You have the right to review your child’s personal information, to have it deleted from the Website, and to limit further collection and use of your child’s personal information.  To do any of the above, please send us an email at  <a href="mailto:customerservice@littlepassports.com" class="body">customerservice@littlepassports.com</a> that details your request, and we will be happy to comply.  Before disclosing child-specific information, we may verify your identity through means such as the following: obtaining a signed form from you via postal mail or fax, receiving an email from you accompanied by your digital signature, or receiving an email from you combined with a unique identifier such as a password.   If you suspect that your child has offered personal information in error and/or you wish us to remove their information from our database, we are happy to do so. Please contact us at  <a href="mailto:customerservice@littlepassports.com"> customerservice@littlepassports.com</a> or at the mailing address below and be sure to include the following: <br>
                                        your child's name and email address <br>
                                        your name and email address <br>
