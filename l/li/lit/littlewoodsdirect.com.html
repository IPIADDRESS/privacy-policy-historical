	This agreement is between us, Littlewoods Finance Company Limited, whose registered office is at Aintree Innovation Centre, Park Lane, Netherton, Bootle L30 1SL (the Creditor) and you.<br><br>
	
    <span class="subheader">Key Financial Information</span><br>
	1. Credit Limit - We will periodically set the credit limit and notify you of it.<br><br>
	2. Repayments - You will be sent a statement every 28 days giving details of all transactions on your account during the period since your last statement or, if there has been no previous statement, since the opening of your account.  The first payment will become due 23 days after the date of your first statement and all subsequent payments will be due 23 days after the date of the statement on which they appear. The due date will be shown on each statement. You will be required to make at least the minimum payment by the due date shown on your statement.  The minimum payment on current balances over Â£100 will be 5% of that current balance, rounded down to the nearest Â£1. The minimum payment on current balances of Â£100 or less will be Â£5 or the full current balance if it is less than Â£5. You may pay more if you wish to do so, including the interest opt-out payment described in clause 1 of the terms and conditions.<br><br>

The various Interest Opt-Outs are detailed in clause 1 of the terms &amp; conditions. No interest will be charged for a statement period if you paid at least the Interest Opt-Out payment on the previous statement by the payment due date. Otherwise, interest will be charged on the daily current balance for the period covered by your statement at the simple daily rate of; If paying the minimum payment by variable direct debit: 0.07018% variable.

	<span class="subheader">Important - Read This Carefully to Find Out About Your Rights</span><br>
	The Consumer Credit Act 1974 lays down certain requirements for your protection which should have been complied with when this agreement was made. If they were not, we cannot enforce this agreement without getting a court order.<br><br>
	The Act also gives you a number of rights:<br><br>
	1) You can settle this agreement at any time by giving notice in writing and paying off the amount you owe under the agreement.<br>
	2) If you received unsatisfactory goods or services paid for under this agreement you may have a right to sue the supplier, us or both.<br>
	3) If the contract is not fulfilled, perhaps because the supplier has gone out of business, you may still be able to sue us.<br><br>
 	If you would like to know more about your rights under the Act, contact either your local Trading Standards Department or your nearest Citizens' Advice Bureau. <br><br>

	<span class="subheader">Further Terms and Conditions</span><br>
	1. Debits to the account, interest opt-outs and buy now pay laters. The following repayment options will be offered on selected purchases as published from time to time:		
	
	<ul class="list" style="margin-left:20px; margin-right:10px;">
	  <li>Interest Opt-Outs - A 3 month Interest Opt-Out will be available on all purchases made on the account, unless a longer Interest Opt-Out period applies. Interest Opt-Outs of 6 months, 12 months, 2 years, 3 years and 4 years will be available on selected products which may be purchased using the account, as publicised from time to time. Each statement will show the minimum payment that you must make to avoid incurring interest on your next statement.  This is the Interest Opt-Out payment. The Interest Opt-Out payment shown on your statement will be calculated to reflect the current balance on your account and all of the relevant interest opt-out offers applicable to the purchases you have made on the account.</li>
	</ul>		
	
	</td>	 
	
	<!-- Right-Hand Column -->
	  
    <td width="310" valign="top" style="padding-left:10px;">   
	
	<ul class="list" style="margin-left:20px; margin-right:10px;">
	  <li>Debits to the account - Purchases made on a 3 month Interest Opt-Out will be charged to your account in full immediately. For purchases to which a longer Interest Opt-Out applies the cost of that purchase on the account will be divided by the number of calendar months in the Interest Opt-Out applicable to that purchase (i.e. 6, 12, 26, 39 or 52) to produce the amount that will be charged to the account on each statement for the duration of the relevant Interest Opt-Out. As an example, for a purchase on the 6 months interest opt-out, one sixth of the purchase price will be charged to the account on each of 6 consecutive statements.</li>
	  <li>Buy Now Pay Later - Purchases made on Buy Now Pay Later promotions will be charged to your account in full on the last statement before the first day of the month specified in the promotion. Once the Buy Now Pay Later transaction is charged to your account it will be shown as part of the current balance and will become liable for interest and payment. Amounts owing under Buy Now Pay Later but not yet charged to your account will not be liable for interest, but will be deducted from your credit limit when we calculate the amount you have left to spend. The amount of credit available to you in relation to your account will be reduced accordingly.</li>
	</ul>	
	
	2.	The credit under this agreement is to be used by you to purchase goods/services from retailers, outlets and brands agreed by us from time to time. We may debit your account on each occasion upon which you provide us with authority to do so, including verbal authority.<br><br>
	3.	We reserve the right to demand from you immediate payment (subject to any statutory notice period) of the full outstanding balance if you fail to make any payment owing under this agreement by its due date. The outstanding balance for all purposes of this agreement will include all sums then due on the account together with all payments due to be charged to your account at any time in the future.<br><br>
	4.	We may close your account immediately, and without notice, if you fail to comply with any terms or conditions of this agreement.<br><br>
	5.	Either you or us may terminate this agreement by giving at least seven days written notice of such to the other. If you terminate the agreement, you must immediately pay the full outstanding balance to us. If we terminate the agreement you will not be able to obtain further credit under this agreement and must repay the full outstanding balance to us on demand.<br><br>

	9.	If we temporarily relax any terms of this agreement e.g. allowing you more time to pay, we may strictly enforce those terms again at any time.<br><br>
	10.	We may transfer any or all of our rights, duties and obligations under this agreement to any other person, or arrange for any other person to carry them out on our behalf, without giving notice to you. Any such transfer will not affect your rights under this agreement, or any other legal rights you may have, such as under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. You may not transfer your rights, duties or obligations under this agreement. <br><br>
	11.	We reserve the right to vary the terms of this agreement at any time to reflect:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;changes in relevant laws<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;changes in our system capabilities<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;changes in market conditions affecting our business<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;new developments in the market place.<br>
We will give you twenty-eight days written notice of the variation. Where any such change is not to your benefit, you may end this agreement by giving us written notice and paying us the full outstanding balance before that change takes effect.<br><br>
	12.	This agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales, which we also take as applying prior to the making of this agreement.<br><br>
	13.	All communications in relation to this agreement will be in English.<br><br>
	14.	If any term of this agreement is unenforceable for any reason, it shall not affect the enforceability of any other term of this agreement.<br><br>
	15.	Unless you notify us to the contrary, we may appropriate any payments received from you to sums due under your account or under any other agreement you have with us as we decide.<br><br>
	16.	References in this agreement to "you" and "your" are to the Customer named above. References to "us" and "we" are to the Creditor named above, and include any other party to whom our rights and/or liabilities under this agreement may be transferred.<br><br>
	17.	We are a financial services company authorised and regulated to carry on insurance mediation business by the Financial Services Authority, under reference number 312190, and licensed by the Office of Fair Trading under consumer credit licence number 535857.<br><br>
	18.	We are required to inform you that there is a possibility that other taxes or costs may exist during the currency of this agreement that are not paid via us or charged by us under this agreement.<br><br>
