Are Cookies   Used on the Site? Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use   Cookies to obtain information about the preferences of our Visitors and   the services they select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to   protect our Authorized Customers. For example, if an Authorized Customer   is logged on and the site is unused for more than 10 minutes, we will   automatically log the Authorized Customer off. </p>

	<p align="left" class="txt3">Disclosure of Personally   Identifiable Information to comply with law. We will disclose Personally   Identifiable Information in order to comply with a court order or   subpoena or a request from a law enforcement agency to release   information.

The Personally Identifiable Information of our   Visitors and Authorized Customers is only accessible to a limited number   of qualified employees who are given a password in order to gain access   to the information. We audit our security systems and processes on a   regular basis. Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or   social security numbers, is protected by encryption protocols, in place   to protect information sent over the Internet.

We   provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to   delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's   database.

An individual who requests to have Personally   Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information   functionally deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally   Identifiable Information relating to that individual in any way moving   forward. What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes? We will let our   Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes to our privacy   policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, if we are changing   our privacy policy in a manner that might   cause disclosure of   Personally Identifiable Information that a Visitor or Authorized   Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we will contact such   Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or Authorized   Customer to prevent such disclosure.
