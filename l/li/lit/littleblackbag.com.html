		<p>Little Black Bag, Inc. ("LBB," "we" or "us") has implemented this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") for its website located at www.littleblackbag.com (the "Website") to provide our members (collectively "Members" or "you") and other users and visitors of the Website (collectively "Users" or "you") information regarding the collection and use of your information on the Website, so that you can make an informed decision about your use of the Website.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk">
		<p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong></p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk">
		<p>1.	<i>Personal Information</i>: We'll ask you to provide certain information if you choose to register with LBB as a Member or otherwise request products, services, or information from us, including your name, email address and your date of birth, address, and other information that identifies you either directly or indirectly (collectively "Personal Information").  You can also import your Personal Information from a third party to make the LBB registration process easier.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk">
		<p>You may also provide Personal Information within your profile on the Website to tell others about yourself, or when taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or other lists.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk">
		<p>Our Website may offer its users the opportunity to post reviews, comments, Newsfeed items, use bulletin board blogs and chat rooms, and tag messages. If you choose to use these features, you should be aware that any Personal Information you submit through these features can be read, collected, or used by other viewers of these forums and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personal Information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk">
		<p>When you register as a Member on the Website using your Facebook username and password, you provide access us to your basic Facebook profile information. Only the information from your Facebook profile that you specifically grant us permission to view during the registration process will be available to us.  The authentication of your Facebook login credentials, however, will be conducted through Facebook alone and not by us or through our Website.  We do not have access to your Facebook login credentials at any time.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk">
		<p>2.	<i>Anonymous Information</i>: </p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk_sub">
		<p>a.	<i>Cookies</i>.  LBB uses cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes and make it easier to navigate the Website. Cookies are small text files that are stored on users’ hard drives. We will not use cookies to collect Personal Information without getting your permission. LBB uses both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Website and expire when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the site easier for returning users by remembering a user's login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk_sub">
		<p>You may choose not to receive cookies from LBB by following instructions in your web browser's "help" file, but this may make certain features of the Website inaccessible to you.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk_sub">
		<p>b.	<i>Clear GIFs/Beacons</i>.  When visiting our Website, we may also use “Clear GIFs” (aka “web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies in our Website and/or in our communications with you. A Clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, that helps us to verify an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message. Clear GIFs allow us to know whether you have viewed a web page prior to visiting our Website and may enable us to relate such information to other information, including your Personal Information. We use information provided from Clear GIFs to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make our Website better for our users.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk_sub">
		<p>c.	<i>IP Address and Clickstream Data</i>.  LBB also collects Members’ and Users’ IP addresses and basic log file information (such as address, browser type and language, number of clicks, domain names of web sites visited, pages viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time) to help locate potential problems with our server and to aggregate general user statistics including demographic and geographical information. We use this information to analyze general usage patterns, and to provide advertisements and other services appropriate to the user’s location. LBB may aggregate user information in a non-personally identifiable manner to share with advertisers and to enhance the Website with new features.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk">
		<p>3.	<i>Content Posted</i></p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk_sub">
		<p>a.	<i>Public Content</i>.  You can contribute to the Website in a number of different ways, including writing reviews, uploading photos, participating in talk threads, filling out your public profile, and voting on other users’ contributions. We may store these contributions (your “Public Content”), display them to other users, and use them for promotional purposes. Note that if you include Personal Information in your Public Content, it can be used and viewed by others. We are not responsible for the information you choose to include in your Public Content.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk_sub">
		<p>b.	<i>Sharing Public Content with Third Party Services</i>.  We allow you to access third party services, such as Facebook and Twitter, to share your selected Public Content with those services, and import information about who you are connected with on those other services so you can connect with them on the Website. You can always opt out on your LBB account page.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk">
		<p><strong>Collection of Your Information by Third-Parties</strong></p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk">
		<p>When you provide information to us on a third-party site or platform (for example, via Facebook), the information you provide may be separately collected by the third-party site or platform. The information we collect is covered by this Privacy Policy and the information the third-party site or platform collects is subject to the third-party site or platform's privacy practices.  Privacy choices you have made on the third-party site or platform will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through our Website.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk">
		<p>We may from time to time supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information to validate or update your address, payment card or other demographic and lifestyle information.  We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to enable us to fulfill our products and services, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.  Local law may require that you authorize the third-party to share your information with us before we can acquire it.</p>

		<p><strong>Online Tracking and Advertising</strong></p>
	</div>

		<p>We, and certain service providers operating on our behalf or with whom we may partner or affiliate, may collect and store information about your activity on our Website or our social networking pages on third-party sites or platforms (“Social Networking Pages”) using tracking technologies, such as cookies, Flash cookies, and web beacons. This tracking data may be used for many purposes, including to provide useful features to simplify your experience when you use our Website and Social Networking Pages, remember your shipping information for future purchases, deliver relevant content based on your preferences, usage patterns and location, monitor and evaluate the use and operation of our Website and Social Networking Pages, analyze traffic on our Website and Social Networking Pages, and provide other services relating to web page activity and internet usage.  We may associate this tracking data with your Account with LBB, in which case, we will treat it as personal information. Service providers that collect tracking data on our behalf may provide an opportunity for you to choose not to be tracked online.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy_content_blk">
		<p>We may also allow advertisers and third parties to collect information about your activity on our Website and Social Networking Pages using tracking technologies, for example, such as Google Analytics. Tracking data collected by these advertisers and third parties may be used to decide which ads you see both on our Website and Social Networking Pages and on third-party sites and applications, but does not identify you personally and is not associated with your LBB Account. You may choose not to receive targeted advertising from many ad networks, data exchanges, marketing analytics and other service providers by clicking <a href="http://www.aboutads.info">here</a>.</p>

We may use local shared objects, sometimes known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our Website to personalize your visit. Our advertisers and third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">here</a>.
