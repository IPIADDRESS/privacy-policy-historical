  <div class="container">

    <p><strong>Effective Date: May 25, 2018</strong></p>

    <p>Your privacy is very important to us.  This Privacy Policy explains our information privacy practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.  When you access and use our website and the Litmus services, features and information available on our website (collectively, the “Services”), you are consenting to the collection, use, storage and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p><strong>1. Key Privacy Points:</strong></p>

    <section class="indented">
    <p>
      <strong>Email Submissions.</strong> Email submissions (“Email Submissions”) uploaded by a customer to our Services belong to that customer.  We don’t use a customer’s Email Submissions, including any resulting email previews generated via the Services (“Email Previews”), for purposes unrelated to that customer or the use of our Services, except in limited circumstances (e.g., we are compelled by subpoena, or the customer has given us permission to do so).  Email Submissions
      <strong><i>should never contain personal data</i></strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Email Analytics.</strong> All data collected by Litmus on behalf of a customer that elects to use our email analytics Services (“Email Analytics”) belongs to that customer.  We don’t use Email Analytics data for purposes unrelated to that customer or the use of our Services, except in aggregated, de-identified form as permitted under our Terms of Service (or such other service agreement between Litmus and the customer) or other limited circumstances (e.g., we are compelled by subpoena, or the customer has given us permission to do so).
    </p>

    <p>
      While we strongly prefer that our customers do <strong><i>not</i></strong> provide us with or collect any personal data in connection with their use of Email Analytics Services, if a customer does elect to provide or collect that information we don’t use it for any other purpose.  Litmus is merely a custodian of that data.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you use Email Analytics Services, you agree to comply with applicable privacy laws, including requirements to inform the recipients of your emails about the specific uses and disclosures of their data described herein, and to directly address any concerns they may have about your privacy policies and/or use of their information for this purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>User Data.</strong> Personal data provided by customers to set up user accounts is used by Litmus only as authorized by the individual user (“User”) or as otherwise permitted by law.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Sharing.</strong> We only share your information in limited circumstances in accordance with applicable law.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Security and Storage.</strong> We hold customer data securely on servers located in the United States.  We leverage Amazon’s AWS infrastructure and built-in security controls, which incorporate several modern security standards and best practices.  Please see our <a target+"_blank"="" href="https://litmus.com/trust">Trust Center</a> for more information on our security practices.

      This policy does not apply to the practices of other businesses that we do not own or control, including third-party websites, services and applications (“Third-Party Services”) that you may access through our Services, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.  While we attempt to partner with only Third-Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we are not responsible for the content or privacy policies of those third parties.  You are responsible to review the privacy policies of any Third-Party Services you access.
    </p>

        <strong>Usage Data.</strong> We collect usage data about you whenever you interact with our Services. This may include which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you performed those actions and other related information. Additionally, like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses, internet service providers, the files viewed on our website (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system versions and timestamps.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Device Data.</strong> We collect data from the devices and applications you use to access our Services, such as IP address, operating system version, device type, system and performance information and browser type.

      <strong>Data Collected Through Use of Email Analytics Services</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      We offer Email Analytics Services that, if available through a customer’s subscription, may allow us to collect data on the customer’s behalf about the emails that the customer sends. We provide a pixel that the customer may include in the body of the emails the customer sends that enables us to collect certain data on the customer’s behalf about its email recipients. &nbsp;Email Analytics Services are intended to allow the email sender to measure the performance of the email message and to learn how to improve email delivery and open rates.  Such data may include, as determined by our customer via its configuration of the Services, the email recipients’ IP addresses, email addresses, the browser and email clients used, geolocation information inferred from IP addresses and details about how their recipients engage with the email (e.g., whether or not the email was read,
      forwarded or printed). <a target="_blank" href="https://litmus.com/help/analytics/csv-export-data-fields">Click here</a> for more information about the data elements processed in connection with Email Analytics Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is in our customers’ discretion as to what data is collected in connection with Email Analytics Services and, therefore, each customer is solely responsible for the collection and use of any such data, including, without limitation, ensuring that such collection and use is in accordance with the customer’s privacy policies and all applicable laws.

    </p>

    <p>
      We use the information we collect from you, on your behalf or related to you in connection with providing our Services to you, including as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <u>Account Setup and Access to Services.</u> You must have an account to use our Services.  Litmus uses the information we collect for the creation of User accounts so that you can access our Services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Customer Support.</u>  We must access and use your information to provide customer support services, including trouble-shooting, managing account usage, responding to billing inquiries, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Service Delivery.</u>  We perform internal evaluations and statistical analysis on the information we collect to, among other things, monitor the performance of our Services, analyze and measure visitor and User behavior and trends, to understand how our Services are used, to help us improve our Services, for market research and to develop new features and functionalities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Enforcement of our Terms of Service.</u>  We monitor Services to ensure that use is in accordance with our Terms of Service (or other service agreement between you and Litmus), including to prevent fraud, as well as illegal, abusive or undesirable activities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Transactional Communications.</u>  We may send you transactional communications (e.g., service-related announcements, billing-related matters, updates to our Terms of Service or other policies, changes to our Services, welcome emails when you register for Services, etc.).  You can’t opt out of receiving these communications since they are required to provide our Services to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Marketing Purposes.</u>  We will only send marketing-related communications if you have consented to receive such communications.  We may combine information about you from third party sources with information we hold about you to create a user profile, which helps us to make our marketing and sales efforts more relevant to you and to personalize and improve your experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Security.</u>  We use your information to maintain the security of our systems and Services (e.g., controlling abuse, spam and DDOS attacks), including the security of your User account.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Legal Requests.</u>  We may need inspect information we hold to determine how to respond to a subpoena or other legal request.  We may also contact you, to the extent permitted, regarding such matters.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>5. Will Litmus Share Any of the Information we Receive?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      We may share your personal data with third parties as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Service Providers.</strong> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide Services to you (e.g., payment processors, hosting services, email service providers and web traffic analytics tools). &nbsp;Unless we tell you differently, our service providers do not have any right to use the personal data we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.  We also implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data is maintained, used only for the provision of their services to us and handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>With Your Organization; Billing Contacts.</strong> If the email address under which you have registered your User account belongs to or is controlled by an organization (e.g., your employer), we may disclose that email address and other pertinent account information to that organization in order to help it understand who associated with that organization uses Litmus, and to assist the organization with its enterprise accounts.  In addition, if your User account details are different from the billing contact listed for your account, we may disclose your identity and the account details to the billing contact upon their request.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User Profiles and Submissions.</strong> Certain User profile information, including without limitation a User’s name and location, and any email, video, image or other content that such User has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other Users to facilitate User interaction within the Services (e.g., to provide examples on our blog or to encourage interaction through a forum hosted on our website) or to address your request for Services and support. &nbsp;Your account privacy settings allow you to limit the other Users who can see the personal data in your User profile and/or what information in your User profile is visible to others. &nbsp;Any information you upload to your public User profile, along with any personal data or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other individuals can view (e.g., on discussion boards, in forums, messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by others. &nbsp;Your username may also be displayed to other Users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through public portions of our websites and other individuals can contact you through messages and comments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Affiliated Businesses and Third-Party Services We Do Not Control.</strong> In certain situations, businesses or Third-Party Services we are affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the our Services (either alone or jointly with us). &nbsp;You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your personal data with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no control over the policies and practices of Third-Party Services as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated Third-Party Service, please review all such policies that may apply.
