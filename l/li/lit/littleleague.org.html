<h3>Advice to Children and Parents</h3>
<p>We strongly advise children to get their parent(s) or guardian(s) to review any information they intend to transmit and get their parents’ or guardians’ permission before submitting any kind of personal data to anyone over the Internet. We urge parents to repeatedly discuss with their children the danger of giving personal information to anyone (online or in person) whom they do not personally know. We also encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children monitoring and reviewing their children’s online activity. As a policy, no person under the age of 13 is permitted to register directly to receive Little League’s electronic communications or participate in Little League social media activities. Such activity, if deemed appropriate, must be conducted by the parent or guardian of such individuals. For additional tips on how to help children stay safe on the Internet, we recommend the following site:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/feature-0002-parents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/feature-0002-parents</a></p>
<h3>What personal information do we collect?</h3>
<p>Little League International requires chartered Little Leagues to submit player registration data, including parent/guardian information and coach/manager data to be in compliance with Regulation IV(g) of the Little League® Official Regulations, Playing Rules and Operating Policies as well as all league officer information at the time of chartering annually. Player registration data must include the date of birth of the player and parent or guardian contact information including a valid email address. The local league must verify the accuracy of such information annually. Submission of the same information from the previous year is not acceptable per the Regulation. A player, manager, or coach must be listed be on the data submitted to Little League International in order to be covered by Little League National Accident Insurance, provided it is purchased by the league. All registration and volunteer data is submitted electronically through the secure “Little League Data Center” on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.littleleague.org/datacenter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LittleLeague.org/datacenter</a>.</p>
<p>The Little League website details the acceptable formats including a downloadable spreadsheet or automatic upload, when available, from Little League’s Official Technology Partner, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Team Sports HQ.</p>
<p>At Little League International, we may collect information in addition to player registration data and coach/manager/volunteer data in order to help identify you and/or your child’s interests in the Little League program and the associated local league or district with which you may be affiliated. For example, we may collect information on our Sites and through our various links to resources and information, and when you enter contests, participate in promotions, express your opinion, shop online, or subscribe to our online portals, emails, social media sites and newsletters.</p>
<h3>How do we use personal information collected and received?</h3>
<p>Any information gathered by Little League International on the Sites, through the League Player Registration and Coach/Manager/Volunteer registration process and/or by any other means, will be used for the purpose of furthering the mission of Little League International and for communicating with individuals as described further below. Little League International does not sell any information collected from you to outside companies.</p>
<p>We may use registration and other personal information to provide program information, special offers or services through Little League International and/or its trusted sponsors, partners, or licensees. We also may use the information to fulfill your requests for information or products or to respond to your inquiries about our programs. We may use this information to communicate with you, such as to update you on new rules, regulations, or risk management issues, to ask your opinion through surveys and research, to register you for or notify you that you have won a contest, or to provide you with the latest news or program updates distributed by Little League International.</p>
<p>The information you provide in connection with our Sites and email communications, online submissions and surveys, social media sites, and communities is used to create an interactive experience. We may combine your registration information with other information that you have provided through social media or other platforms and may use this information to facilitate conversation and to occasionally offer you information, programs, and services.</p>
<p>Should you receive information from Little League or one of our partners, this information will be clearly identified with Little League International identification marks in adherence with our trademark registration.</p>
<p>In addition, the data provided to Little League International is utilized in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>To catalog and record each individual player into a yearly listing of participants in the Little League program. These records are maintained in the Little League archives and for historical purposes through the World of Little League®: Peter J. McGovern Museum and Official Store. This information may also be used for operational issues that may arise with respect to verification and eligibility of the participants in a local league program.</li>
<li>To maintain a record of the volunteers, including coaches and managers involved in the Little League program and their associated team and/or league. This information is used to provide seasonal training materials, to send the Little League Magazine for their team’s players during the season as well as operational issues that may arise requiring contact with Little League International.</li>
<li>Email addresses provided to Little League International through the league player record sharing process by each player’s parent(s) or guardian(s), and coach and/or manager are incorporated into Little League International’s electronic database. Every communication sent will provide you an option to “Opt-Out”. You also have the opportunity to “Opt-Out” of any Little League controlled electronic large group communication at any time by sending an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:LLInternational@LittleLeague.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LLInternational@LittleLeague.org</a>&nbsp;and typing “Unsubscribe” in the subject line or by clicking on the “Safe Unsubscribe™” link at the bottom of any email you receive from us.</li>
<li>Household mailing addresses reported by leagues are occasionally used to provide information to those residents about the Little League program. Should information be sent, it will be sent under the cover of “Current Resident” or “To the Parent or Guardian of Little League Participant.”</li>
</ul>
<p>We may be required to share your personal information and non-personal information pursuant to judicial or governmental subpoenas, warrants, or orders. If we are required to do so, we will, of course, obey the law. In addition, notwithstanding any term to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we reserve the right to use, disclose, and/or share your personal and non-personal information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<h3>Third-Party Links and Websites</h3>
<p>Please note that some information you receive may direct you to a non-Little League website. Please refer to these web sites for specific Privacy Policies and use of data as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>
<h3>Individual Submissions and Promotions</h3>
<p>We may offer coupons, special discounts, contests, games, and promotions on behalf of Little League International and/or our national partners; or invite you to submit stories, photos, comments, or questions to certain areas of our Sites. On these occasions, we may ask you to voluntarily submit additional information along with your submission so that we can notify you if you are a winner, or to respond to (or ask) questions. No individual under the age of 13 should submit information to any of the situations noted above.</p>
<h3>Cookies and Pixel Tags — What are they?</h3>
<p>Cookies and pixel tags are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies and pixel tags make Internet surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, preferences and preferred websites as you browse. The use of cookies and pixel tags are an industry standard – you will find that they are used by most major websites. By showing how and when visitors use the site, cookies and pixel tags can also help website developers see which areas are popular and which are not and can help you find information that is most relevant to you based on your search history. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive new cookies or how to disable cookies altogether. If you reject cookies, you may not be able to participate in certain activities or receive a promotion tailored to you. The Sites do not control and do not guarantee the effectiveness of browser-based tools for managing cookies.</p>
<h3>Does the Little League website use cookies or pixel tags?</h3>
<p>Yes. As you browse the Sites, cookies, pixel tags, or similar technology may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what information interests you on our site, in order to continue to provide information in the future. On occasion, we may provide target advertising through partners like AdRoll and Facebook to present you with additional information about our program and its offerings based on your previous interaction with LittleLeague.org. These techniques do not collect information such as your name, email address, postal address, or telephone number. We also work with third party companies to assist us with website analytics such as evaluating the use and operation of our website so that we can continue to enhance the website(s) and the information contained within. You can visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">networkadvertising.org/choices&nbsp;</a>and/or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aboutads.info/choices</a>&nbsp;to opt-out of tracking and targeted advertising using cookies or similar technology.</p>
<p>Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals and therefore, the Little League websites do not recognize DNT.</p>
<h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we may share your information for marketing purposes, as described above. California residents are entitled to request and obtain from us once per calendar year information about any of your personal information shared with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes, including the categories of information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we have shared such information. To request this information and for any other questions about our privacy practices and compliance with California law, please contact us as described below.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Little League International reserves the right to modify this policy from time to time as Little League International determines to be appropriate. We will post any changes to this policy on the Little League website. We may contact you with notices concerning our Privacy Policy, but you should check our website periodically to review any changes.</p>
<h3>Our Commitment to Security</h3>
<p>Little League International has implemented reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial processes to safeguard the privacy of the information it obtains.</p>
<h3>Questions or Concerns</h3>
<p>This policy was last updated on December 7, 2017. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding the Little League International Privacy Policy, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@LittleLeague.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy@LittleLeague.org</a>.</p>
<h3>Local Leagues – Include Opt-In to Privacy Policy During Registration</h3>
<p>A copy of this Privacy Policy is available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.littleleague.org/PrivacyPolicy.htm?utm_source=LL.org%20Privacy%20Policy&amp;utm_medium=Privacy%20Policy%20Link&amp;utm_content=LL.org%20Privacy%20Policy">LittleLeague.org/privacypolicy</a>. We strongly encourage all local Little Leagues to incorporate this policy into the registration process for participant families and volunteers by including a signature on the policy at registration. It is also encouraged that local leagues post the policy on local league websites.</p>
