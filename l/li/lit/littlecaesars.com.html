        <strong>  a. Personal and Demographic Information</strong>.

We may collect this information through various forms and places on the Sites, including account registration forms, newsletter sign-ups, gift card order forms, franchise inquiry forms, resume submission forms, contact us forms, and when you otherwise communicate with us via the Sites.  If we combine Demographic Information with Personal Information we collect, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.  Of course, you are free to visit our Sites without providing any Personal Information or Demographic Information but some parts of the Sites may not be available to you if choose note to provide this information. 
          <br>
          <br>
       <strong>b.	Anonymous Information</strong>.  When you interact with our Sites, our servers may keep an activity log that does not identify you individually (“<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>”).  We collect and store certain administrative and traffic information with each use of the Sites including: source IP address, time of access, date of access, web page(s), type of browser used, access times and referring websites addresses.  If we associate Anonymous Information  with you as a specific person, we will treat it as Personal Information
        <br>
        <br>
       <strong>c.	Device Identifiers</strong>.  We automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“<strong>Device Identifier</strong>”) for your Device used to access our Sites. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Sites, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.  Some mobile service providers may also provide us or other third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access the Sites.</p>

          <strong>2. TECHNOLOGY USED ON OUR SITES</strong><br>
          <br>
          <strong>a. Cookies.</strong> We may use cookies, which are small data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites.  A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.  For more information on cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at www.allaboutcookies.org.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>b. Web Beacons.</strong> We may use “Web Beacons” which are small graphic images or other web programming code (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) in our web pages and e-mail messages.  Web Beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a Web Beacon.<br>
          <br>
<strong>c. Embedded Script.</strong>We may use embedded script which is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites, such as the links on which you click.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.<br>

	<strong>3. INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES ABOUT YOU</strong><br><br>
We may supplement the information we collect about you on the Sites with outside records from third parties, such as leads received from franchisee referral websites, in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.  We may combine the information we receive from those sources with information we collect through the Sites.  In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.
