  <p>Privacy Policy of Lijit Networks, Inc.</p>
<p>Lijit Networks, Inc. (“<strong>Lijit</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, or “<strong>we</strong>”) takes the privacy and protection of your personal information very seriously.  By visiting the Lijit website, located at http://www.lijit.com (the “<strong>Website</strong>”), and/or using any of our other services (the Website and other services Lijit offers are collectively referred to as “<strong>Lijit Services</strong>” in this privacy policy), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”). </p>
<p><strong>What This Privacy Policy Covers</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes Lijit’s use of Personal Information and Anonymous Information that we collect when you use our Lijit Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use of your Personal Information by third parties that Lijit does not own or control, or to individuals that we do not control or manage.</p>
<p>“<strong>Personal Information</strong>” is information about you that is personally identifiable to you like your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.</p>
<p>“<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>” means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons. </p>
<p>We collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy Policy from the visitors of our Website, and from the registered users of our Lijit Services (“<strong>Users</strong>”).</p>
<p><strong>BY USING THE LIJIT SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR LIJIT SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</strong></p><strong>
</strong><p><strong>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>The Personal Information we gather from you helps us learn more about the visitors and Users of our Lijit Services. We collect the following Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily:</p>
<p>Our registration process requires you to provide Lijit with a valid email address as well as a username and password of your choice. We may also request optional information, such as your first and last name, year of birth, zip code, and country of residence.<br>
When you sign up to receive the Lijit newsletter, we will collect your email address.<br>
When you contact us by sending us an email, we will collect any information that is contained in your email.</p>
<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Lijit Services you are able to use.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information Collected Via Technology</strong></p>
<p>As you use the Lijit Services, certain information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, and operation system. Lijit also stores a small text file called a “<strong>Cookie</strong>” on your computer to store your login information. Lijit may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). You must have Cookies enabled in your web browser to use the Lijit Services. </p>
<p>We may also contract with advertisers in order to promote third party products and/or services by placing advertisements on the Lijit Services. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third party and the advertiser and/or third party may also use Cookies in connection with these advertisements. This Privacy Policy covers the use of Cookies by Lijit only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. Any advertisements appearing in conjunction with the Lijit Services are delivered by third parties. For information about our advertising partners, please visit their websites through the links included in the presentation of the advertisements.</p>
<p>Lijit also uses Cookies and other navigational data that is passively collected, to gather information about your visit to the Lijit Services and the information which you searched and viewed on the Services.  Lijit may store this information as Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information From Other Sources</strong></p>
<p>We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources like telephone or fax, or from third parties that provide services for us in connection with the Lijit Services. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Lijit Services.</p>
<p><strong>Use Of Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>In general, Personal Information you submit to us is used by us either to register you for our Lijit Services, respond to requests that you make, to improve our Lijit Services and to better tailor the features, performance and support of the Lijit Services, and to offer you additional information, opportunities, and functionality.<br>
We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails, should you request to receive such communications from us.</p>
<p>One of the ideas behind our Lijit Services is that the Users share information about websites. Therefore, you should assume that any information that you enter into or post on the Lijit Services (excluding your registration information) will be openly shared with other Users of the Lijit Services and may also be available to people outside the Lijit Services. Please be aware that if you enter any Personal Information into publicly available sections of the Lijit Services, this information will be displayed to anyone who has access to these sections.</p>
<p>We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the information personally identifiable to you.  We may use this Anonymous Information to analyze usage patterns so that we may enhance our Lijit Services.  We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to third parties in our discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
<p>If you provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any purpose, provided we do not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. We will collect any information contained in such feedback and will treat the Personal Information in it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not trade, rent, or share your Personal Information with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so. </p>
<p>We may provide your Personal Information to third party service providers who work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the services and features of the Lijit Services and to help us communicate with Users. Examples of such services include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. However, these service providers do not have any independent right to share this information (expect pursuant to a legal requirement such as a subpoena or warrant).</p>
<p>We share Anonymous Information about our visitors and Users with our partners and advertisers.  This Anonymous Information may include, but is not limited to, browser type, URLs visited, and search terms entered. </p>
<p>Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “<strong>Affiliates</strong>”), we may in the future. We may share some or all of your Personal Information with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>In the event Lijit goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Lijit or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. You hereby consent to Lijit sharing your Personal Information under the above circumstances.<br>
We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of us, the visitors and Users of our Services, or third parties.</p>

You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature, but if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to deactivate your account, which involves termination of the <a href="terms_of_use">Terms of Use</a> and the EULA[hyperlink].</p>
