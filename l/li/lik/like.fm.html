If you choose to provide such information, you are giving Like.fm permission to use and store that information consistent with this policy.  Additionally, please know that when you register or sign in to the Like.fm Service, you are not anonymous to us.  
      <ul>
        <li>
        Facebook Connect: You may connect your Like.fm account with your Facebook account.
