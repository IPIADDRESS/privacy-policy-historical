				<div class="postContent">
				<p>LikeNaruto.com is committed to protecting your privacy when you use our website currently located at www.LikeNaruto.com and the LikeNaruto client, a downloadable application that enables users to view content. This Privacy Policy informs you of the types of information we collect about you, how that information is used, whether and to whom we disclose it, and the choices you have regarding your personal information.</p>
<p>It is very important that you read and understand our Privacy Policy. If you do not accept the terms set out in our Privacy Policy, please do not use LikeNaruto.com.</p>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Your visit to or use of LikeNaruto constitutes your acceptance of the terms of our Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult our Privacy Policy regularly for any changes (revisions will be reflected by the “last update” notation below).</p>
<p><strong>Principles of the LikeNaruto Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we      truly need it.</li>

<li>It covers how LikeNaruto treats personal information – that is, personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>General Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LikeNaruto collects personal information when you register with LikeNaruto to use LikeNaruto services or to post content on LikeNaruto.</li>
<li>When you register, we ask for your email address.</li>
<li>LikeNaruto receives and records information on our server logs      from your browser, including your IP address, cookie, and the page you      request in order to operate the LikeNaruto service.</li>
<li>LikeNaruto uses Google Analytics to view aggregate      statistics about the usage of the LikeNaruto service.</li>
</ul>

<p>IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page.</p>
<p>IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>To diagnose or service technology problems reported by      our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled      by a specific web company or ISP.</li>
<li>To tailor advertising based on geographic area or other      information derived from your IP address. Aggregate information derived      from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.</li>
