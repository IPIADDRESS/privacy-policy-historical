          <p>
            We receive and store any information you enter on our Site or give us in any other way,
            such as via telephone, electronic mail or online form. For example, this information

            when you contact us for customer support. Here are the types of information we gather

          </p>
          <h3>
            Contact Information:
          </h3>
          <p>
            We are required by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"),
            the organization which assumes responsibility for domain name allocation, to collect
            certain information about you duringthe domain name registration process.
          </p>
          <p>
            This information includes your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address,
            and, where provided, your facsimile number. Such contact information may be used, for
            example, to communicate with you when necessary with respect to transactions conducted
            through the Site. Additionally, we may collect contact information provided to us
            during any correspondence relating to customer support we supply to you, as well as in
            connection with products and services offered on the Site.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Financial Information:
          </h3>
          <p>
            We also collect and retain certain financial information from you during the domain
            name registration process, as well as in connection with other products and services
            which we offer on the Site. For example, when you apply to register a domain name or
            sign up for any other product or service through LibyanSpider.com, we require you to
            provide a credit card number and billing address before we will process that
            application. We will not sell, share or rent any financial information collected from
            you except as disclosed in this policy or as necessary to fulfill your order.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Demographic Information:
          </h3>
          <p>
            We may collect and store anonymous demographic information (such as your zip code,
            gender and age), and use this data to tailor your experience at our Site, provide
            content that we think you might be interested in, and display the content according to
            your preferences. Such demographic information may be shared with partners, market
            researchers and other third parties on an aggregate, non-personally identifiable basis.
            No personally identifiable information will be linked to aggregated demographic
            information.

            information to you which we believe might be of interest. In addition, such information

            aggregate, non personally identifiable basis. No personally identifiable information
            will be linked to such aggregated information shared with third parties. In addition,

            How Secure Is Information About Me?
          </h2>
          <p>
            We work to protect the security of your financial information during transmission by
            using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") software, which encrypts the information you input
            on the Site. Additionally, we reveal only the last five digits of your credit card
            numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we must transmit the entire credit card
            number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. You can further
            help to ensure your security by taking a few simple precautions. For instance, it is
            important to protect against unauthorized access to your LibyanSpider.com username and
            password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared
            computer.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will take reasonable care to protect your personal information once it is
            transferred to us, but it is ultimately your responsibility to prevent the disclosure
            of your personal information outside of LibyanSpider.com, as well as any disclosure on
            the LibyanSpider.com Site which is due to your error.
