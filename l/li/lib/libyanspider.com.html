				<p class="paragraph">We receive and store any information you 
				enter on our Site or give us in any other way, such as via 
				telephone, electronic mail or online form. For example, this 
				information may be collected when you register a domain name or
				<br>
				when you contact us for customer support. Here are the types of 
				information we gather from visitors to LibyanSpider.com:<br>
&nbsp;</p><ul>
					<li>
					<p class="hosting"><b>Contact Information: </b>We are 
					required by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and 
					Numbers ("ICANN"), the organization which assumes 
					responsibility for domain name allocation, to collect 
					certain information about you during <br>
					the domain name registration process. This information 
					includes your full name, mailing address, phone number, 
					email address, and, where provided, your facsimile number. 
					Such contact information may be used, for example, to <br>
					communicate with you when necessary with respect to 
					transactions conducted through the Site. Additionally, we 
					may collect contact information provided to us during any 
					correspondence relating to customer support we supply to 
					you, as well as in connection with products and services 
					offered on the Site.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li>
					<p class="hosting"><b>Financial Information:</b> We also 
					collect and retain certain financial information from you 
					during the domain name registration process, as well as in 
					connection with other products and services which we offer 
					on the Site. For example, when you apply to register a 
					domain name or sign up for any other product or service 
					through LibyanSpider.com, we require you to provide a credit 
					card number and billing address before we will process that 
					application. We will not sell, share or rent any financial 
					information collected from you except as disclosed in this
					<br>
					policy or as necessary to fulfill your order.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li>
					<p class="hosting"><b>Demographic Information:</b> We may 
					collect and store anonymous demographic information (such as 
					your zip code, gender and age), and use this data to tailor 
					your experience at our Site, provide content that we think 
					you might be interested in, and display the content 
					according to your preferences. Such demographic information 
					may be shared with partners, market researchers and other 
					third parties on an aggregate, non-personally identifiable 
					basis. No personally identifiable information will be linked 
					to aggregated demographic information.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li>
					<p class="hosting"><b>Internet Protocol Address:</b> We 
					collect and retain an IP address from all visitors to the 
					LibyanSpider.com Site. We use your IP address to help 
					diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Site 
					and for purposes of traffic analysis within the Site, and to 
					help prevent fraud. No personally identifiable information 
					will be linked to such information.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li>
					<p class="hosting"><b>Other Information:</b> We collect and 
					store certain types of information whenever you interact 
					with us. For example, our servers track the type of Web 
					browser you are using, and the page to which you link from 
					LibyanSpider.com. We collect this information to better 
					develop a sense of what services our customers need, but not 
					to track your individual usage patterns, except within the 
					Site. We may use such information for marketing purposes, 
					and to send information to you which we believe might be of 
					interest. In addition, such information may be shared with 
					partners, market researchers and other third parties on an 
					aggregate, non personally identifiable basis. No personally 
					identifiable information will be linked to such aggregated 
					information shared with third parties. In addition, we may 
					obtain non-sensitive contact information from third parties, 
					including via bulk access licenses from other registrars.
					<br>

					<p class="hosting"><b>Cookies:</b> The LibyanSpider.com Site 
					may use "cookie" technology for such purposes as enhancing 
					your online experience by making it easier for you to 
					navigate through the Site and making certain features work 
					better. Cookies <br>

				<ul>
					<li>
					<p class="hosting"><b>WHOIS Information:</b> ICANN requires 
					LibyanSpider.com to make certain information, collected in 
					connection with the registration of a domain name, available 
					to the public via an interactive Web page and a "port 43" 
					WHOIS service. This information includes your full name,

					name server information associated with your domain name. 
					For the purposes of this Privacy Notice we will refer to 
					this information collectively as your "WHOIS Information." 
					Please note that we may not be able to control how members 
					of the public may use the WHOIS Information<br>
					. </p></li>
					<li>
					<p class="hosting"><b>Bulk Access:</b> If you have opted-in 
					to having your WHOIS Information available for bulk access, 
					ICANN also requires LibyanSpider.com to make that 
					information available to third parties who enter into a bulk 
					WHOIS data access agreement with LibyanSpider.com. In making 
					your selection to opt-in to having your WHOIS Information 
					available for bulk access. <br>
					<br>
					Please note that if you have not opted-in to having your 
					WHOIS Information available for bulk access for marketing or 
					other purposes, your WHOIS Information will still be made 
					available to the public through the "port 43" WHOIS service
					<br>
					described above.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li>
					<p class="hosting"><b>Third Parties:</b> If you have 
					opted-in to receiving information about products and 
					services provided by LibyanSpider.com's partners and 
					affiliates, we will share your name, address, phone number 
					and email address, in addition to information provided by 
					you in response to our opt-in survey, so that the 
					appropriate partners and affiliates may contact you 
					regarding the products and services in which you have 
					expressed interest. LibyanSpider.com cannot guarantee that 
					these third parties will offer the same level of protection 
					as LibyanSpider.com, or that their protections will be 
					adequate.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li>
					<p class="hosting">Agents and Service Providers: We engage 
					other companies, individuals and subsidiaries of 
					LibyanSpider.com to perform certain functions and/or 
					services to our customers. Examples may include processing 
					credit card payments, providing marketing assistance and 
					removing repetitive information from customer lists, as well 
					as offering electronic mail services and making available 
					digital certificates. <br>
					<br>
					Additionally, if you register a domain name through 
					LibyanSpider.com, we may forward certain information you 
					provide to the appropriate registry handling the 
					administration of your chosen top level domain. Your contact 
					and financial information may either be collected by or 
					shared with such third parties as necessary, and in some 
					cases, your information may be retained or used by such 
					third parties.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li>
					<p class="hosting">Partner Web Sites and Pages. 
					LibyanSpider.com sometimes enters into agreements in which 
					we jointly develop or operate Web sites with third parties 
					("Partner Site"). Any information collected via a Partner 
					Site may be jointly owned by LibyanSpider.com and the 
					applicable third party partner, or, alternatively, owned 
					solely by us or the third party partner. It is your 
					responsibility to check the privacy policy of such third 
					parties before submitting any personal information to a 
					Partner Site.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li>
					<p class="hosting">Business Transfers: As we continue to 
					develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or 
					their assets. In such transactions, customer information 
					generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, 
					if LibyanSpider.com, . or all or substantially all of its 
					assets were ever to be acquired, customer information will 
					of course be one of the transferred assets.<br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
					<li>
					<p class="hosting">Protection of LibyanSpider.com and 
					Others: We may release account and other personal 
					information when we are required to do so by law, court 
					order or other government or law enforcement authority or 
					regulatory agency, including ICANN; to enforce or apply our 
					Services Agreement or other agreements; or when we believe 
					in good faith that disclosing this information is necessary 
					or advisable, including, for example, to protect the rights, 
					property, or safety of LibyanSpider.com, our users, or 
					others. This includes exchanging information with other 
					companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit 
					risk reduction.<br>
					<br>

				<p class="paragraph">We work to protect the security of your 
				financial information during transmission by using Secure 
				Sockets Layer ("SSL") software, which encrypts the information 
				you input on the Site. Additionally, we reveal only the last 
				five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an 
				order. Of course, we must transmit the entire credit card number 
				to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 
				You can further help to ensure your security by taking a few 
				simple precautions. For instance, it is important to protect 
				against unauthorized access to your LibyanSpider.com username 
				and password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when 
				finished using a shared computer. We will take reasonable care 
				to protect your personal information once it is transferred to

				LibyanSpider.com, as well as any disclosure on the 
				LibyanSpider.com Site which is due to your error.</p>
