<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p class="lead">Librato, Inc. ("Librato") is committed to protecting your privacy. We have
prepared this Privacy Statement to describe to you our practices regarding
the Technical Data and Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from
users of our websites, the Librato products (the "Products"), or related
services.</p>

<dl class="l-margin-bottom-8 l-margin-top-2">
<dt>User Consent</dt>

<dd>By submitting or making available Technical Data or Personal Data through
our websites, Products, or related services, you agree to the terms of
this Privacy Statement and you consent to the processing of your Technical
Data and Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Your
Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected
and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding
processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your
country.</dd>

<dt>A Note About Children</dt>

<dd>We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under
the age of 13.</dd>

<dt>Types of Data We Collect</dt>

<dd>Librato collects Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit
our site, when you send us information or communications, and/or when you
download and use our Products. "Personal Data" means data that allows
someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name,
address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public
information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the
foregoing data. "Anonymous Data" means data about you that is not
associated with or linked to your Personal Data (but does not include
Technical Data, which is covered later in this Privacy Statement);
Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons.
We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.</dd>

<dt>Personal Data You Provide to Us</dt>

<dd>We collect Personal Data from you, such as first and last name, e-mail and
mailing addresses, telephone number, professional title, company name, and
password, when you purchase Products, register to receive information, or
register for support forums. In addition, we (or our third-party credit
card or payment processor on our behalf) will collect Personal Data
including your credit card number or account information when you purchase
Products or services on our websites. We also retain information on your
behalf, such as the Personal Data described above and any correspondence
or forum postings. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail
(e.g., in response to an employment opportunity posted on our websites),
we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content
included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information
that you submit to us, such as a resume. When you participate in one of
our surveys, we may collect additional profile information. When you post
messages on the message boards of our websites, the information contained
in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able
to see it. We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide
to us voluntarily, such as operating system and version, information about
your application and operating environment, and other requested
information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support for the
Products). We may also collect Personal Data at other points in our
websites that state that Personal Data is being collected.</dd>

<dt>Personal Data Collected via Technology</dt>

<dd>To make our websites, Products, and related services more useful to you,
our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider)
collect Personal Data from you, such as browser type, operating system,
Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to
your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to
session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We may
also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform
Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time
of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and
which you viewed. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather
this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit our
websites or access your account on our network.</dd>

"computer's hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use both
"session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and
"persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to
"provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our
"websites. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser
"help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our
"websites may not work properly.</dd>

<dt>Personal Data Collected by Third Parties</dt>

<dd>We may receive Personal Data about you from other sources like telephone
or fax, from companies that provide our Products or services by way of a
co-branded or private-labeled website, companies that offer their products
and/or services on our websites, or companies that provide services (such
as payment processing services) in connection with our websites ("Partner
Companies"). Our Partner Companies may supply us with Personal Data, such
as your name and e-mail and mailing address information, in order to help
us establish the account or fulfill orders. We may add this information to
the information we have already collected from you via our websites in
order to perform and improve the Products and services we provide.</dd>

<dd>Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Privacy Statement, only

location or its contents. When you click on such a link, you will leave
our site and go to another site. During this process, a third party may
collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you.</dd>

<dd>We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for,
these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of
this Privacy Statement do not apply to these outside websites or content,

Technical Data and Personal Data in such communication in accordance with
this Privacy Statement.</dd>

<dt>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</dt>

<dd>To disclose information to a third party, organizations must apply the
notice and choice principles. Where an organization wishes to transfer
information to a third party that is acting as an agent, it may do so if
it makes sure that the third party subscribes to the Safe Harbor
principles or is subject to the Directive or another adequacy finding. As
an alternative, the organization can enter into a written agreement with
such third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same
level of privacy protection as is.</dd>

<dd>We may share your Personal Data with third parties to provide technical
support or to provide specific services, such as payment processing for
purchases.</dd>

obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy
Statement.</dd>
