<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p><strong><em>Last Updated: May 5, 2010.</em></strong></p>

<p>Librato respects your privacy and is committed to maintaining the
privacy and confidentiality of personal data we collect. The purpose
of our Privacy Statement is to demonstrate our firm commitment to
the privacy and protection of all persons who provide personal data
to Librato and its affiliates. This Privacy Statement describes the
ways we collect information from and about you, and what we do with
the information, so that you may decide whether or not to provide
information to us.</p>

<p>By visiting Librato websites or are otherwise providing your
personal information to Librato via any other means, you are
accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy
Statement.</p>

<p>For purposes of this Privacy Statement, the term “visitor” includes
visitors to our websites who are not yet customers, those who become
customers, as well as those who do not become customers; whether you
upload information to our websites, download it, or are merely
visiting our websites. You can choose not to provide certain
information when using our websites but then you might not be able
to take advantage of many of its features.</p>

<h3>1. WHAT DO WE COLLECT AND WHERE?</h3>

<p>The information we collect may include your personal information,
such as your name, contact information, financial account numbers,
IP addresses, Live Chat Messages, Telephone conversations, product
and service selections and orders or other things that identify you
individually.</p>

<p>Generally, we may collect information about you in the following
manners:</p>

<ul>
<li>you may provide your personal information to us via chat, email or
other written correspondence, telephone calls, web based forms, or
other means;</li>
<li>we use automated technical means to collect information about all
website visitors for example by use of cookies;</li>
<li>via third party providers; and</li>
<li>we provide services which you may sign up for.  If you sign up for
a service, personal identification information to identify your
account will be collected.  If you choose to install our
services on your servers, we collect information about your
server including but not limited to hardware configuration and
operational metrics.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Web Visit</h4>

<p>You may visit our Websites in any of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>By using your browser to navigate to our Website:
<a href="http://www.librato.com">http://www.librato.com</a>;</li>
<li>By viewing an advertisement displayed on a third party website
that is served content by our web server;</li>
<li>By viewing an email that is served content by our web server.</li>
</ul>


<p>When you visit our Website, our server logs your <strong>IP address</strong> (unique
network addresses), the time and duration of your visit, and the
time and duration of the pages on our website you view. If you
arrive at our website by clicking a paid advertisement (including a
paid search engine result) or a link in an email, then we will
capture information that tracks your visit from that link. If you
arrive at our Website by clicking a non-paid source, such as link in
a non-paid search engine result or an unsponsored link on another
website, we may capture information that tracks your visit from that
source, to the extent we are able to do so. We may also capture
information about your computer system, such as your browser type
and operating system.</p>

<p>We will likely place a <strong>cookie</strong> on your hard drive during the web
visit. A cookie is a unique alphanumeric identifier that we use to
help us identify the number of unique visitors to our Website,
whether or not those visitors are repeat visitors, and the source of
the visits. Cookies cannot be executed as code or used to deliver a
virus. Other servers cannot read them and personal information
cannot be gathered from them. They are simply an identifier shared
between you and us to allow us to improve the services we offer to
you through our Website. If you do not wish cookies to be placed on
your computer, then they can be disabled in your web browser. The
option to do so is normally found in your browser's "security
settings" section. However, please note, permanently disabling
cookies in your browser may hinder your use of our Website as well
as other websites and interactive services.</p>

<p>A <strong>web beacon</strong>, also known as a web bug, is a small graphic (usually 1
pixel x 1 pixel), that is embedded in a web advertisement, email, or
page on our web site, but is invisible to you. When you view a page
on our web site, an email or an advertisement your web browser will
request the web beacon from a web server, which in turn will set a
cookie in your web browser containing a unique identifier. This
unique identifier will be linked to log information that is used to
track your movements on our web site in order to determine the
effectiveness of content and advertising campaigns.</p>

<p>We do not collect personal information about you as part of a web
visit, but web visit information may be tied to other information
(including personal information) we collect from you via chat, web
forms, and the other means we describe in this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p>Our advertising agencies may also use web beacons and cookies to
track your activity on our website originating from the
advertisement. However, we will not provide your personal
information to our advertising agencies. Our advertising agencies
maintain their own privacy policies, and you should also review
those.</p>

<h4>Links to non-Librato Websites</h4>

<p>We may provide links to third-party websites for your convenience
and information. The privacy practices of those sites may differ
from Librato practices and are not controlled by Librato and covered
by this Privacy Statement. We do not make any representations about
third-party websites. We encourage you to review their privacy
policies before submitting your personal data.</p>

<h4>Sensitive Information</h4>

<p>We will not intentionally collect or maintain, and do not want you
to provide, any information regarding your medical or health
condition, race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or
philosophical beliefs or other sensitive information.</p>

<h4>Children’s Online Privacy Protection</h4>

<p>Our services are not designed for or directed to children under the
age of 13, and we will not intentionally collect or maintain
information about anyone under the age of 13.</p>

<h3>2. WHAT DO WE USE THIS INFORMATION FOR?</h3>

<h4>Personal Information</h4>

<p>We may use your information to process your service requests, handle
orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate
with you about orders, provide access to secure areas of the
Website, recommend merchandise and services that might be of
interest to you, to personalize your visit to our Website, and to
enable us to review develop and continually improve the products
services and offers we provide online. We also use this information
to prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our Website and to enable
third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions
on our behalf.</p>

<h4>Contact Information</h4>

<p>We use visitor information to send information about our company to
visitors and to get in touch with them when necessary. We also use
the information we collect to improve the content of our websites
and as training aides for our employees. Visitors are given the
choice at the point when we request their information.</p>

<h4>Financial Information and payment card details</h4>

<p>We may ask visitors to enter credit card or account information in
order to process orders for services placed with Librato or its
affiliates. Financial information provided via our website is
transferred over a secure connection. We collect this information on
a transaction-by-transaction basis and will not authorize the
release of the information with anyone not directly involved in
processing the transaction. This information may be encrypted and
stored for logging purposes in accordance with applicable regulatory
requirements.</p>

<p>Credit card numbers are used only for processing payments and are
not used for any other purposes. When we use third party service
providers for credit card processing services we will enter into a
written agreement with such third party ensuring appropriate
security and confidentiality measures are in place in safeguarding
your personal data.</p>

<h4>Visitor Tracking</h4>

<p>We use web visit information to measure interest in and develop our
web pages and marketing plans, customize the content you view on
your web visits based on your activity on past visits, and
administer our Website.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>We use the visitors’ IP address</strong> to help diagnose problems with
our servers, and to administer our Websites.</li>
<li><strong>We use cookies</strong> to help us recognize visitors as unique
visitors (just a number) when they return to our websites For
example, if there are 1,000 visits to our website on a certain
day, we can use cookies to discover how many of those visits were
made via the same browser (same visitor). We may also use the
cookie to discover whether a certain visitor has visited our site
more than once, and the source for each visit. We also use cookies
to: allow us to tailor content or advertisements to match your
preferred interest; avoid showing visitors the same advertisements
repeatedly; compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us
to understand how users use our site and to help us improve the
structure of our Website (we cannot identify visitors personally
in this way); count the number of anonymous users of our sites.</li>
<li><strong>We use web beacons</strong> to count the number of times that our
advertisements and web-based email content are viewed. We combine
web beacon information with cookies to track activity on our
website originating from advertisements and web-based email
content.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Telephone, Chat, Email, Forms, Etc.</h4>

<p>We use information you provide to us via telephone calls, chat,
email, web forms and other communications to correspond with you
about services you may be interested in purchasing. If you elect to
purchase a service online using a web form, we will use the
information to establish your account.Information you submit in
writing, such as chat, email, and web form information is archived
and may be tied to information that we collect about your web
visits. Your telephone call may be recorded for training purposes
and we may enter information you provide via telephone into our
systems to use for the purposes described in this paragraph.</p>

download and install one of our products or services.  We may use
this data in aggregate with other server information to determine
