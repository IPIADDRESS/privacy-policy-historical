On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service-related announcement as indicated in <a href="#usageofinformation">Section 5.4</a> of this Privacy Policy. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications because they are not promotional in nature. However, they can deactivate their account by sending a request via <a href="https://www.libertyreserve.com/en/contactus">contact us</a> form. Those users who request the deactivation of their accounts will receive a confirmation email within the next 48 hours and will be effectively removed from the list of users to whom these communications are sent.<br><br><a name="customerservice"></a>
<h3>5.3. Customer Service</h3>
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested customer-services and solve issues related to their accounts. These communications are usually made via email or through the live chat service provided in our website.<br><br><a name="blog"></a>
<h3>5.4. Blog</h3>
Our Website offers a publicly accessible blog. Said blog is used as an additional communication channel where we post announcements that may be of interest for our users. Although we do not allow our users to reply those posts, from time to time we may use our blog to place surveys and collect non-personally identifiable information from those willing to help us improve our service.
