<h2>Uses and Disclosures of Your Personal Health Information</h2>
<p>
    <b>Your Authorization:</b> Except as outlined below, we will not use or disclose your personal health information for any purpose unless you have signed a form authorizing the use or disclosure. 
    You have the right to revoke that authorization in writing unless we have taken any action in reliance on the authorization.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Disclosures for Treatment:</b> We will make disclosures of your personal health information as necessary for your treatment. 
    For instance, a doctor or health facility involved in your care may request some of your personal health information that we hold in order to make decisions about your care.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Uses and Disclosures for Payment:</b> We will make uses and disclosures of your personal health information as necessary for payment purposes. 
    For instance, we may use information regarding your medical procedures and treatment to process and arrange for the payment of medical bills, to determine whether services are medically 
    appropriate or to otherwise pre-authorize or certify services as eligible to be shared under the Guidelines. We may also forward such information to another health plan that may also have an 
    obligation to process and pay expenses on your behalf.
</p>
<p>    
    <b>Uses and Disclosures for Health Care Operations:</b> We will use and disclose your personal health information as necessary for our health care operations which include 
    peer review, business management, accreditation and licensing, utilization review and management, quality improvement and assurance, enrollment, voluntary disclosure
    of health conditions, compliance, auditing, and other functions related to your healthcare management. We may also disclose your personal health information to another 
    health care facility, health care professional, or health plan for such things as quality assurance and case management, but only if that facility, professional, or plan also has or had a 
    patient relationship with you.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Family and Friends Involved In Your Care:</b> With your approval, we may from time to time disclose your personal health information to designated family, friends, and others 
    who are involved in your care or in payment for your care in order to facilitate that person's involvement in caring for you or paying for your care. If you are unavailable,
    incapacitated, or facing an emergency medical situation and we determine that a limited disclosure may be in your best interest, we may share limited personal health information 
    with such individuals without your approval. We may also disclose limited personal health information to a public or private entity that is authorized to assist in disaster
    relief efforts in order for that entity to locate a family member or other persons that may be involved in some aspect of caring for you.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Business Associates:</b> Certain aspects and components of our services are performed through contracts with outside persons or organizations, such as legal services, 
    Utilization Management Services, Preferred Provider Organizations, Pharmacy Benefit Managers, etc. At times it may be necessary for us to provide some of your personal health
    information to one or more of these outside persons or organizations who assist us with our health care operations. In all cases, we require these business associates to appropriately 
    safeguard the privacy of your information.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Communications With You:</b> We may communicate with you regarding your medical expenses, share amount, or other things connected with your health. In the event you could be endangered if all or 
    part of the information being sent to you is viewed by another person, you have the right to request and we will accommodate reasonable requests by you to receive communications regarding your personal 
    health information from us by alternative means or at alternative locations. For instance, if you wish messages to not be left on voice mail or sent to a particular
    address, we will accommodate reasonable requests. You may request such confidential communication in writing and may send your request to Liberty HealthShareâ„  at the address listed in the 
    For Further Information section at the end of this notice.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Other Health-Related Products or Services:</b> We may, from time to time, use your personal health information to determine whether you might be interested in or benefit from treatment 
    alternatives or other health-related programs, products or services which may be available to you as a member. For example, we may use your personal
    health information to identify whether you have a particular illness, and contact you to advise you that a disease management program to help you manage your illness better is available to you as a member. 
    We will not use your information to communicate with you about products or services that are not health-related without your written permission.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Information Received Pre-enrollment:</b> We may request and receive from you and your health care providers personal health information prior to your enrollment in Liberty HealthShareâ„ . 
    We will use this information to determine whether you are eligible to enroll. We will protect the confidentiality of that information in the same manner as all other personal health information
