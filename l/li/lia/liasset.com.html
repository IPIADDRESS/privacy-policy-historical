We believe that our service allows our Members to effectively compete and achieve their full career potential. The cornerstone of our business is to focus on our Members first.</p>
        <p>Maintaining your trust is our top priority, so we adhere to the following principles to protect your privacy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We protect your personal information and will only provide it to third parties: (1) with your consent; (2) where it is necessary to carry out your instructions; (3) as reasonably necessary in order to provide LinkedIn features and functionality to you; (4) as we reasonably believe is permitted by law or regulation; or (5) as necessary to enforce our User Agreement or protect the rights, property, or safety of LinkedIn, its Members, and the public.</li>
          <li>We have implemented appropriate security safeguards designed to protect your information in accordance with industry standards.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, and if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice through our website, apps, or other services  (“LinkedIn” or “Service”) or by other means so that you may review the changes before you continue to use LinkedIn. If you object to any changes, you may close your account. Continuing to use LinkedIn after we publish or communicate a notice about any changes to this Privacy Policy means that you are consenting to the changes.</p>

        <p>Our Privacy Policy applies to anyone with a LinkedIn account. If you live in the U.S., LinkedIn Corporation controls your information. If you live outside the U.S., LinkedIn Ireland Limited controls your information.</p>

      <div class="full-copy">
        <h3>A. Data Controllers</h3>
        <p>If you reside in the United States, then the personal information provided to or gathered by LinkedIn is controlled by LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, California 94043. If you reside outside the United States, then the personal information provided to or gathered by LinkedIn is controlled by LinkedIn Ireland Limited, Gardner House, Wilton Place, Wilton Plaza, Dublin 2, Ireland. If you have any concern about providing information to us or having such information displayed on the LinkedIn services or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, you should not become a Member of LinkedIn or visit our website. If you have already registered, you should <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/secure/settings?closemyaccountstart=">close your account</a>. We collect your personal information in the following ways:</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="brief-copy">
        <p>When you create an account with us, you provide us with information (including your name, email address, and password) that we use to offer you a personalized, relevant experience on LinkedIn.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="full-copy">
        <h3>B. Registration</h3>
        <p>To create an account on LinkedIn, you must provide us with at least your name, email address, and a password. You can choose to provide further information about yourself during the registration process (for example, your gender and location). We use this additional information to provide you with more customized services like language-specific profile pages and updates, more relevant ads, and more valuable career opportunities, and it may appear on your LInkedIn profile that is viewable by others. You understand that, by creating an account, LinkedIn and others will be able to identify you by your LinkedIn profile, and you allow LinkedIn to use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our <a href="/legal/user-agreement">User Agreement</a>.  We may also ask for your credit card details if you purchase certain LinkedIn services.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="brief-copy">
        <p>You can add professional details – like your job title, education, and skills – to your profile.  A complete profile helps you be found by other people for opportunities. It also means we can show you relevant ads.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="full-copy">
        <h3>C. Profile Information</h3>
        <p>After you create an account, you may choose to provide additional information on your LinkedIn <a href="/profile/edit">profile</a>, such as descriptions of your skills, professional experience, and educational background. You can list honors, awards, professional affiliations, LinkedIn Group memberships, networking objectives, companies or individuals that you follow, and other information. With your approval, your connections may provide recommendations and endorsements of you. Providing additional information enables you to derive more benefit from LinkedIn by helping you express your professional identity; find other professionals, opportunities, and information; and help recruiters find you. It also enables us to serve you ads and other relevant content on and off LinkedIn.</p>

        <p>We collect information when you sync non-LinkedIn content – like your email address book, mobile device contacts, or calendar – with your account. We use this information to improve your experience. You can remove your address book and any other synced information whenever you'd like.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="full-copy">
        <h3>D. Address Book, LinkedIn Contacts, and Other Services That Sync with LinkedIn</h3>
        <p>You may use the LinkedIn contacts importer to upload individual contacts or your entire address book into LinkedIn.  LinkedIn stores this information and uses it to help you manage it with “LinkedIn Contacts,” which can be your primary resource for storing, organizing, and utilizing your contact information.  LinkedIn also uses this information to help you grow your LinkedIn network by: identifying your contacts already on LinkedIn; providing a template to send invitations to your contacts that have not registered with LinkedIn; and suggesting people you may know who are already Members of LinkedIn but who may not be in your LinkedIn Contacts.  Please note that when you send an invitation to connect to another individual (a “connection”), that person will have access to your email address because it is displayed in the invitation. LinkedIn will also remind you of pending invitations. Your LinkedIn connections will also have access to your email address.</p>
        <p>LinkedIn makes other tools available to sync information with LinkedIn, and may also develop additional features that allow members to use their LinkedIn account in conjunction with other third-party services. For example, LinkedIn’s iPad and iPhone applications allow you to sync your device’s calendar with LinkedIn to show you the LinkedIn profiles of meeting attendees.</p>
        <p>Another example is Rapportive, which allows you to see LinkedIn and other public social media information about the people you email. If you grant these products (mobile applications, Rapportive, or other LinkedIn applications that sync external email services) permission to access your email accounts, they will access your email header information in order to match it to LinkedIn and other public social media profiles. LinkedIn’s products that sync with external email services will also temporarily cache message content for performance reasons; however, the cached message content will be temporarily cached in a way that is unreadable by LinkedIn and its service providers.</p>
        <p>Any information that you upload or sync with LinkedIn is covered by the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy.  You can remove your information at your convenience using the features LinkedIn makes available or in accordance with Section 3.	We collect information when you sync non-LinkedIn content—like your email address book, mobile device contacts, or calendar—with your account. We use this information to improve your experience. You can remove your address book and any other synced information at any time.</p>

        <p>We collect information when you use the LinkedIn website, LinkedIn applications (for example, LinkedIn for iPhone or Android), and LinkedIn platform technology (such as “Share on LinkedIn” plugins for publishers). For example, we collect information when you view or click on ads, import your address book, join and participate in groups, participate in polls, install a LinkedIn mobile application, and share articles on LinkedIn.</p>

        <h3>G. Using Third-Party Services and Visiting Third-Party Sites</h3>
        <p>We receive information when you use your LinkedIn account to log in to a third-party website or application. Also, when you visit a third-party site that embeds LinkedIn professional plugins (such as “Share on LinkedIn” for publishers) we receive information that those pages have loaded in your web browser.  If you are logged in as a LinkedIn Member when you visit sites with LinkedIn plugins, we use this information to recommend tailored content to you.  LinkedIn will use this information to personalize the LinkedIn-provided functionality on third-party sites, including providing you insights from your LinkedIn network and allowing you to share information with your network (1st and 2nd degree connection on LinkedIn). Users wishing to disable this personalization may <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/settings/?tab=groups&amp;modal=nsettings-data-sharing">opt out</a> here. LinkedIn’s retention of this data is addressed in Section 3.B.  We do not use this information for advertising. LinkedIn may provide reports containing aggregated impression information to companies hosting LinkedIn plugins and similar technologies to help them measure LinkedIn-generated traffic to their websites.  You can opt out of LinkedIn using your impression data by clicking <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/settings/?tab=groups&amp;modal=nsettings-offsite-privacy-management">here</a>.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Advertising technologies like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers as permitted by mobile platforms;</li>
          <li>Member-provided profile information and categories (for example, “product managers in Texas”);</li>
          <li>Information inferred from a Member’s profile (for example, using job titles to infer age, industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; or names to infer gender).</li>
          <li>Your use of LinkedIn (for example, your LinkedIn search history) or clicking on a LinkedIn ad.</li>
          <li>Information from advertising partners which we use to help deliver ads more relevant to you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not share personally identifiable information with any third-party advertiser or ad network, although your profile is visible to other LinkedIn Members and through public search depending on your settings.</p>
        <p>LinkedIn may show you sponsored content in your Network Update Stream (NUS), which will be designated as sponsored content and will behave like other NUS updates. If you take social action (for example, if you “like or “comment” on the sponsored content), your action will be seen by your network and other LinkedIn Members who are shown the sponsored content after you have acted on it.</p>
        <p>LinkedIn ads that are delivered on third-party sites contain the label “Ads by LinkedIn.”  You may opt out of these ads served to you on third-party sites <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/settings/?tab=account&amp;modal=nsettings-enhanced-advertising">here</a>. The Ad Choices icon shows you that we adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising.

Also, advertisers receive the URL of the page that you are on when you click an ad on LinkedIn. We also receive the internet protocol (“IP”) address of your computer or the proxy server that you use to access the web, your computer operating system, your type of web browser, your mobile device (including your mobile device identifier provided by your mobile device operating system), your mobile operating system (if you are accessing LinkedIn using a mobile device), and the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier.

        <h3>K. Other</h3>
        <p>LinkedIn is a dynamic, innovative environment, which means we are always seeking to improve the services we offer you. We often introduce new features, some of which may result in the collection of new information (for example, when the Endorsements feature launched, we began collecting information about skills for which Members were endorsed and the individuals who endorsed them). Furthermore, new partnerships or corporate acquisitions may result in new features, and we may potentially collect new types of information.</p>

Other people may find your LinkedIn profile information through search engines (you can choose which parts of your public profile are accessible to public search engines in your settings), or use services like Twitter in conjunction with your LinkedIn account.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="full-copy">
        <h3>F. Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3>
        <p>LinkedIn offers a “public profile” feature that allows Members to publish portions of their LinkedIn profile to the public Internet. This public profile will be indexed and displayed through public search engines when someone searches for your name. You may choose the parts of your profile that search engines index or completely opt out of this feature in your <a href="/profile/public-profile-settings">settings</a>. However, third-party search engines may not automatically update their caches, which may contain old public profile information. Unless you delete it, your profile on LinkedIn is always viewable on the LinkedIn Services.</p>
        <p>We do not rent or sell personal information that you have not posted on LinkedIn, except as described in this Privacy Policy. We will not disclose personal information that is not published to your profile or generated through engagement with other LinkedIn services, such as Groups and Company Pages, without your consent or to carry out your instructions (for example, to process payment information) unless LinkedIn has a good faith belief that disclosure is permitted by law or is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Privacy Policy or our User Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; (4) respond to Member service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or safety of LinkedIn, our Members, or the public. See Section 2.N for additional details about LinkedIn’s compliance with legal requests for information.  LinkedIn supports middleware providers that offer archiving solutions to firms subject to financial services regulation, which, with your permission, facilitate the archiving of your communications and other LinkedIn activity by a third party for compliance purposes.</p>
        <p>Content distributed through LinkedIn’s sharing features and third-party integrations may result in displaying some of your personal information outside of LinkedIn. For example, when you post content to a LinkedIn Group that is open for public discussion, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in search engine results. Also, if you have bound your LinkedIn account to your Twitter account, you can easily share content from LinkedIn to Twitter.</p>

        <p>We collaborate with and allow third parties to use LinkedIn’s developer platform to offer services and functionality in conjunction with LinkedIn. These third-party developers have either negotiated an agreement to use LinkedIn platform technology or have agreed to our self-service API and Plugin terms in order to build applications (“Platform Applications”). Both the negotiated agreements and our API and Plugin terms contain restrictions on how third parties may access, store, and use the personal information you provide to LinkedIn. If you choose to use a Platform Application, you will be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and user agreement of the third-party developer. To revoke permission granted to a Platform Application, please visit your <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/settings/">settings</a>. Note, however, that even if you revoke the permission granted to a Platform Application, your connections may still be using the Platform Application, so the Platform Application may still have access to certain information about you, just as your connections do. You may opt out of providing information to third-party developers through your connections by accessing the “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/settings/?tab=groups&amp;modal=nsettings-data-sharing">Turn on/off data sharing with third-party applications</a>” control in the “Groups, Companies, and Applications” tab under <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/settings/?tab=groups">settings</a>.</p>

LinkedIn or third parties may follow up with you via InMail regarding your participation unless you have opted out of receiving InMail messages. We may use third parties to deliver incentives to you to participate in surveys or polls.

It is up to you whether you provide this information, or whether you desire to take advantage of an incentive. Your consent to use any personally identifiable information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it. LinkedIn is a member of the Council of American Survey Research Organizations (“CASRO”) and abides by CASRO guidelines for market research. You may opt out of participating in surveys by changing your <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/settings/?tab=email&amp;modal=nsettings-research-invitations">settings</a> to stop receiving these inquiries and requests.</p>

        <p>We offer a premium service to recruiters, which can be used to search for, organize, and communicate with potential candidates.

        <h3>L. Recruiters</h3>
        <p>We offer customized people-search functionality along with organizational and communications tools as part of our “LinkedIn Recruiter” premium service. LinkedIn Recruiter allows subscribers – generally, enterprises and professional organizations - to export limited information from Members’ public profiles, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and location (for example, San Francisco Bay Area), in order to effectively manage candidate sourcing. You may limit or prevent LinkedIn Recruiter subscribers from exporting your profile information by configuring your public profile visibility settings to restrict access to these fields. We do not provide email or other contact information to Recruiter subscribers. However, if you post that information as part of your profile it will be available to others. A LinkedIn Recruiter subscriber may also manage and store information it has independently obtained about you outside of the Service, such as a resume, in its licensed LinkedIn Recruiter platform. Any personal information obtained independently of LinkedIn services are not under LinkedIn’s control but are subject to the policies of the LinkedIn Recruiter subscriber. We store such information on behalf of the LinkedIn Recruiter subscriber who can remove it at any time. We do not further process such information.</p>

        <h3>A. Rights to Access, Correct, or Delete Your Information, and Closing Your Account</h3>
        <p>You have a right to (1) access, modify, correct, or delete your personal information controlled by LinkedIn regarding your profile, (2) change or remove your content, and (3) close your account.  You can also contact us for any account information which is not on your profile or readily accessible to you. If you <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/secure/settings?closemyaccountstart=">close your account</a>, your information will generally be removed from the Service within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information and will de-identify any logs or other backup information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.</p>
        <p><strong>Please note:</strong> Information you have shared with others (for example, through InMail, network updates, content sharing, or LinkedIn Groups) or that others have copied may also remain visible after you have closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile. LinkedIn Groups content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. In addition, you may not be able to access, correct, or eliminate any information about you that other Members copied or exported out of LinkedIn, because this information may not be in our control. Your public profile may be displayed in search engine results until the search engine refreshes its cache.</p>

We may retain personal information, for a limited period of time, if requested by law enforcement. LinkedIn Customer Service may retain information for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only, but we generally delete closed account data consistent with Section 3.A., except in the case of our plugin impression data, which we de-personalize after 12 months unless you opt out.</p>
