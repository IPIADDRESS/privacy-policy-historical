										<h1>Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</h1>
										<p>Thank you for visiting the LIPA Web 
										site. We hope your visit is helpful and 
										informative.</p>
										<p>This Web site is designed to make it 
										easier and more efficient for visitors 
										to learn about and interact with LIPA. 
										Like all online resources, we recognize 
										that Web site visitors are concerned 
										about issues of privacy and security of 
										information and the quality and accuracy 
										of the information presented. LIPA is 
										committed to preserving your privacy and 
										security while visiting our Internet 
										site, and to giving you the most 
										accurate information possible.</p>
										<p>Information provided on this Web site 
										is intended to allow the visitor access 
										to public information, and does not 
										represent business, legal or other 
										advice. While all attempts are made to 
										provide accurate, current and reliable 
										information, LIPA recognizes the 
										possibility of human and/or mechanical 
										error. LIPA makes no representations as 
										to the accuracy, completeness, currency 
										or suitability of the information 
										provided by this Web site, and deny any 
										expressed or implied warranty as to the 
										same. In offering that information, 
										LIPA, its affiliates, agents and 
										contractors assume no responsibility or 
										liability. Reference in this web site to 
										any specific commercial products, 
										processes, or services, or the use of 
										any trade, firm or corporation name is 
										for the information and convenience of 
										the public, and does not constitute 
										endorsement, recommendation, or favoring 
										by LIPA, its employees or agents.</p>
										<p>This policy describes LIPAâ€™s privacy 
										practices regarding information 
										collected from visitors to this Web 
										site. In addition, this policy describes 
										what data is collected and how that 
										information is used. LIPA may, at its 
										sole discretion, change, modify, add or 
										delete portions of this policy. Because 
										this privacy policy only applies to this 
										Web site, you should examine the privacy 
										policy of any Web site, including other 
										State Web sites you access through this 
										Web site.</p>
										<p><b>Information Collected When You 
										Visit This Web site<br>
										</b>When visiting this Web site, LIPA 
										automatically collects and stores the 
										following information about your visit:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>The Internet Protocol address 
											and domain name of your Internet 
											service provider. The Internet 
											Protocol address is a numerical 
											identifier assigned either to your 
											Internet service provider or 
											directly to your computer, which can 
											be used to direct internet traffic 
											to you;</li>
											<li>The type of browser and 
											operating system you used;</li>
											<li>The date and time you visited 
											this site;</li>
											<li>The web pages or services you 
											accessed at this site and the files 
											that you downloaded; </li>
											<li>The URL or address of the Web 
											site you visited prior to coming to 
											this Web site and from which any web 
											page on this site was linked.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>This information is used to improve 
										this Web siteâ€™s content and to help LIPA 
										understand how people are using this Web 
										site. This information is collected for 
										statistical analysis, to determine what 
										information is of most and least 
										interest to our visitors, and to 
										identify system performance or problem 
										areas. This information is not collected 
										for commercial marketing purposes and 
										LIPA does not sell or distribute the 
										information collected from the Web site 
										for commercial marketing purposes. The 
										information is retained in accordance 
										with the public record retention 
										provisions in the State Arts and 
										Cultural Affairs Law.</p>
										<p><b>Information Collected When You 
										Access LIPA Services E-mail or This Site
										<br>
										</b>This Web site provides access to 
										some LIPA customer services. Information 
										that you submit when accessing customer 
										services will be collected. If during 
										your visit to this Web site, you access 
										a customer service or send an e-mail to 
										LIPA, your e-mail address and the 
										contents of your e-mail or communication 
										will also be collected. The information 
										collected is not limited to text 
										characters and may include audio, video 
										and graphic information formats that you 
										send to LIPA. <br>
										<br>
										The information contained in your e-mail 
										or communication will be used to access 
										customer services, respond to you, 
										address that issues you identify, 
										further improve this Web site, or 
										forward your e-mail or communication to 
										another agency or entity for appropriate 
										action. Information received by LIPA 
										from your communication with this Web 
										site, including your e-mail address, is 
										not collected for commercial marketing 
										purposes, and LIPA does not sell or 
										distribute such information for 
										commercial marketing purposes. The 
										information is retained in accordance 
										with the public record retention 
										provisions in the State Arts and 
										Cultural Affairs Law.</p>
										<p><b>Personal Information and Choice<br>
										</b>"Personal Information" is 
										information about an individual (e.g., 
										an individualâ€™s name, address and phone 
										number). A domain name or Internet 
										Protocol address is not considered 
										personal information. </p>
										<p>Personal information is not collected 
										through this Web site unless you 
										voluntarily provide it by directly 
										communicating with LIPA. If you do not 
										communicate with this Web site it does 
										not affect your ability to use any of 
										the other features of this Web site. </p>
										<p>LIPA does not knowingly collect 
										personal information from children or 
										create profiles of children through this 
										Web site. LIPA cautions that the 
										collection of personal information 
										provided by any individual in an e-mail 
										will be treated the same as information 
										given by an adult, and may, if not 
										protected by federal or State law, be 
										subject to public access. LIPA 
										encourages parents and teachers to be 
										involved in childrenâ€™s Internet 
										activities and guide the children 
										whenever children are asked to provide 
										personal information on-line.</p>
										<p><b>Disclosure of Information 
										Collected Through This Web site<br>
										</b>If not protected by federal or State 
										law, personal information collected 
										through this Web site may be subject to 
										disclosure pursuant to law, such as the 
										Freedom of Information Law (FOIL), the 
										Personal Privacy Protection Law (PPPL), 
										the federal Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy 
										Protection Act, court order, subpoena or 
										other legal process. In addition, LIPA 
										may disclose personal information to 
										federal or State law enforcement 
										authorities to enforce its rights 
										against unauthorized access or attempted 
										unauthorized access to LIPAâ€™s 
										information.</p>
										<p><b>Cookies<br>
										</b>To better serve you, we occasionally 
										use "cookies" to enhance or customize 
										your visit to this Web site. Cookies 
										created on the device you use to access 
										this Web site do not contain personally 
										identifiable information, and do not 
										compromise your privacy and security. We 
										use the cookie feature to store a 
										randomly generated identifying tag on 
										the device you use to access this Web 
										site. The use of cookies is a standard 
										practice among Internet Web sites. The 
										software and hardware you use to access 
										this Web site allows you to refuse the 
										cookie or delete the cookie file at any 
										time.</p>
										<p><b>Security</b><br>
										LIPA limits employee access to 
										personally identifiable information from 
										this Web site to only those employees 
										who need access to perform a specific 
										job. Security measures have been 
										integrated into the design, 
										implementation, and day-to-day 
										operations of this Web site as part of 
										LIPAâ€™s continuing commitment to the 
										security of electric content as well as 
										the electronic transmission of 
										information.</p>
										<p>The information contained in this 
										policy should not be construed in any 
										way as giving business, legal or other 
										advice, or warranting as fail proof, the 
										security of information provided via 
										this Web site. For site security 
										purposes and to ensure that this Web 
										site remains available to all users, 
										LIPA employs software to monitor traffic 
										to identify unauthorized attempts to 
										upload or change information or 
										otherwise cause damage to this Web site.
										</p>
										<p><b>Links Disclaimer<br>
										</b>In order to provide visitors with 
										certain information, this Web site 
										provides links to local, State and 
										federal government agencies, and Web 
										sites of other entities. A link does not 
										constitute an endorsement of the 
										content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, 
										policy, products, services, or 
										accessibility of that Web site. Once you 
										link to another Web site from this Web 
										site, including one maintained by the
