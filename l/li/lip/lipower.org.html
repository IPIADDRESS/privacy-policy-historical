				LIPA Web site. We hope your visit is helpful and informative.</p>
				<p>This Web site is designed to make it easier and more 
				efficient for visitors to learn about and interact with LIPA. 
				Like all online resources, we recognize that Web site visitors 
				are concerned about issues of privacy and security of 
				information and the quality and accuracy of the information 
				presented. LIPA is committed to preserving your privacy and

				that information is used. LIPA may, at its sole discretion, 
				change, modify, add or delete portions of this policy. Because 
				this privacy policy only applies to this Web site, you should 
				examine the privacy policy of any Web site, including other 
				State Web sites you access through this Web site.</p>

				This information is not collected for commercial marketing 
				purposes and LIPA does not sell or distribute the information 
				collected from the Web site for commercial marketing purposes. 
				The information is retained in accordance with the public record 
				retention provisions in the State Arts and Cultural Affairs Law.</p>
				<p><b>Information Collected When You Access LIPA Services E-mail 
				or This Site <br>
				</b>This Web site provides access to some LIPA customer services. 
				Information that you submit when accessing customer services 
				will be collected. If during your visit to this Web site, you 
				access a customer service or send an e-mail to LIPA, your e-mail 
				address and the contents of your e-mail or communication will 
				also be collected. The information collected is not limited to 
				text characters and may include audio, video and graphic 
				information formats that you send to LIPA. <br>

				<p><b>Personal Information and Choice<br>
				</b>"Personal Information" is information about an individual 
				(e.g., an individual’s name, address and phone number). A domain 
				name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal 
				information. </p>
				<p>Personal information is not collected through this Web site 
				unless you voluntarily provide it by directly communicating with 
				LIPA. If you do not communicate with this Web site it does not 
				affect your ability to use any of the other features of this Web 
				site. </p>
				<p>LIPA does not knowingly collect personal information from 
				children or create profiles of children through this Web site. 
				LIPA cautions that the collection of personal information 
				provided by any individual in an e-mail will be treated the same 
				as information given by an adult, and may, if not protected by 
				federal or State law, be subject to public access. LIPA 
				encourages parents and teachers to be involved in children’s 
				Internet activities and guide the children whenever children are 
				asked to provide personal information on-line.</p>
				<p><b>Disclosure of Information Collected Through This Web site<br>
				</b>If not protected by federal or State law, personal 
				information collected through this Web site may be subject to 
				disclosure pursuant to law, such as the Freedom of Information 
				Law (FOIL), the Personal Privacy Protection Law (PPPL), the 
				federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, court order, 
				subpoena or other legal process. In addition, LIPA may disclose 
				personal information to federal or State law enforcement 
				authorities to enforce its rights against unauthorized access or 
				attempted unauthorized access to LIPA’s information.</p>
				<p><b>Cookies<br>
				</b>To better serve you, we occasionally use "cookies" to enhance 
				or customize your visit to this Web site. Cookies created on the 
				device you use to access this Web site do not contain personally 
				identifiable information, and do not compromise your privacy and 
				security. We use the cookie feature to store a randomly 
				generated identifying tag on the device you use to access this 
				Web site. The use of cookies is a standard practice among 
				Internet Web sites. The software and hardware you use to access 
				this Web site allows you to refuse the cookie or delete the 
				cookie file at any time.</p>
				<p><b>Security</b><br>
				LIPA limits employee access to personally identifiable 
				information from this Web site to only those employees who need 
				access to perform a specific job. Security measures have been 
				integrated into the design, implementation, and day-to-day 
				operations of this Web site as part of LIPA’s continuing 
				commitment to the security of electric content as well as the 
				electronic transmission of information.</p>
				<p>The information contained in this policy should not be 
				construed in any way as giving business, legal or other advice, 
				or warranting as fail proof, the security of information 
				provided via this Web site. For site security purposes and to 
				ensure that this Web site remains available to all users, LIPA 
				employs software to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized 
				attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause 
				damage to this Web site. </p>
				<p><b>Links Disclaimer<br>
				</b>In order to provide visitors with certain information, this 
				Web site provides links to local, State and federal government 
				agencies, and Web sites of other entities. A link does not 
				constitute an endorsement of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, 
				opinions, policy, products, services, or accessibility of that 
				Web site. Once you link to another Web site from this Web site, 
				including one maintained by the State, you are subject to the 
				terms and conditions of that Web site, including, but not 
				limited to, its privacy policy. </p>
				<p><b><a name="Podcasts">Podcasts</a></b><br>
				LIPA’s podcasting service (the "Podcast Service") consists of 
				news and information audio files (the "Podcast Content") that 
				may be downloaded from LIPA’s web site (“Site”) to your computer 
				and/or transferred to your portable MP3 player. </p>
				<p>These Terms of Use and LIPA’s Privacy Policy govern your use 
				of the Podcasting Service. Any uses of the Podcasting Service 
				not granted herein are strictly prohibited. Prohibited uses 
				include, but are not limited to, the incorporation of 
				advertising or the placement of advertising associated with or 
				targeted at the Podcast Content, redistribution of the Podcast 
				Content and the use of the Podcast Content in a manner which 
				suggests or implies that LIPA endorses any products, services or 
				causes of a third party. You may not edit or modify the Podcast 
				Content or links in any manner whatsoever.</p>
				<p>You may only use the Podcasting Service with platforms which 
				provide a functional link that, when accessed, takes the user 
				directly to the podcast feed on the Site. The Podcast Content 
				may be used only in a manner which allows linking or redirection 
				to or delivery of the applicable page on the Site. You may not 
				display the Podcast Content in a manner that does not permit 
				successful linking to, redirection to or delivery of the 
				applicable LIPA Site web page. You may not insert any 
				intermediate page, splash page or any other content between the 
				podcast link and the applicable page on the Site. LIPA retains 
				all ownership and other rights in the Podcast Content and in any 
				and all LIPA logos and trademarks used in connection with the 
				Podcasting Service. If applicable, you must provide attribution 
				to the appropriate page on the Site in connection with your use 
				of the Podcasting Service, and, if you use a graphic in the 
				attribution, you must use the appropriate LIPA logo incorporated 
				into the Podcast Content.</p>
				<p>Any suggestions, comments or other feedback ("Feedback") 
				offered to LIPA with respect to the Podcast Service is and will 
				be given entirely voluntarily. LIPA shall be free to use, 
				disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute and exploit 
				Feedback provided to it as it sees fit. </p>
				<p>LIPA reserves the right to cease offering any or all of the 
				Podcasting Service or Podcast Content at any time or to require 
				you to cease any and all use of the Podcasting Service or 
				Podcast Content at any time for any reason. LIPA assumes no 
				liability for your activities in connection with the Podcasting 
				Service or for your use of the Podcast Content in connection 
				with your website, computer or MP3 player.</p>

				review and correct personal information you submitted to LIPA,
