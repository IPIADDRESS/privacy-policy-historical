							we will have you promptly removed.</p>
						<p><b><u>How Secure Is My Information?</u></b></p>
						<p>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using

							important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and 
							to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</p>
						<p><b><u>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</u></b></p>
						<p>Unless stated otherwise, our Privacy Policy applies to all information that we
