</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><b>Effective Date - September 15, 2009</b></font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Cambria">We recognize the importance of your 
privacy. Please read the following policy (the "Privacy Policy") 
to understand how your information will be treated. These privacy practices 
apply to the websites, associated widgets, mobile applications and other 
distribution platforms (the "Sites") operated by JoMa Ventures, 
Inc. ("JoMa").</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria">Our Sites and associated communications 
from us may contain links to third-party sites, which are not subject 
to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you read the privacy policy 
of any such sites that you visit. This Privacy Policy applies only to 
the Sites.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria">This Privacy Policy may change from 
time to time. We will post any changes on this page and, if the changes 
are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (which may 
include email notification of policy changes for those that have created 
accounts and provided an email address). Each version of this Privacy 
Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date.  
Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of our Privacy Policy 
whenever you visit the Sites for any updates or changes.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><b>Consent</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria">By visiting our Sites, you are consenting 
to the information collection, use and sharing practices described in 
this Privacy Policy, as modified from time to time by us. In order to 
access certain functionalities of the Sites you will be required to 
register by providing certain information</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><b>What this Privacy Policy Does NOT 
Address</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria">This Privacy Policy does not address 
the data management practices and policies of and information usage 
policies of other sites to which the Sites may link to or on which a 
JoMa widget may be installed.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><b>Information We Collect</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria">The information we collect from visitors 
to our Sites depends upon how visitors choose to interact with us through 
the Sites. We offer some services that do not require you to register 
for an account or provide any personal information to us. For example, 
you can read materials such as our blogs without providing personal 
information. However, using our full range of services involves providing 
personal information to us. Personal information is information that 
can be used to identify you, such as your name, address, email address, 
telephone number or billing information. When you register with us and 
sign in to our Sites, we recognize that you are not anonymous to us.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria">The following is a list of types of 
information we may collect and ways in which it is collected:</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Information you 
provide.</u> When you sign up for a service that require registration, 
we ask you for personal information such as your name and email address. 
We also collect information you provide when requesting a service, and 
this information may, among other things, include personal information 
or reveal details about your preferences. We typically store and maintain 
the information collected.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Logged information.</u> We automatically 
collect and store some information that you do not actively provide, 
such as your internet protocol (IP) address, software and hardware attributes 
such as browser type, the date and time of your visit, and the last 
website you visited prior to visiting the Sites.  This information 
is used to enhance the services we provide to you.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Cookies.</u> When you visit the 
Sites, we send one or more cookies (that is, small text files) to your 
computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Most browsers are initially 
set up to accept cookies, but you can change your browser's settings 
to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, 
some features and services will not function properly if cookies are 
disabled. Cookies may contain account information such as your user 
name and password if you opt in to the automatic login option.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Other Internet technology.</u> We 
may use other technology, such as pixel tags and web beacons, to track 
use of our Sites. We may also include web beacons in email messages, 
newsletters, or other communications to determine whether messages have 
been opened and acted upon. We may receive an anonymous identification 
number if you come to our Sites from an online advertisement displayed 
on a third-party website. The information we obtain in this manner enables 
us to customize the services we offer our website visitors, to deliver 
targeted advertisements, and to measure the usage and effectiveness 
of our Sites and our online advertising and other content and activities.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><b>How We Use The Information</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria">In general we use personal and other 
information collected through the Sites to fulfill your requests for 
services, contact you, customize advertising and content, and improve 
our services. More specifically, we use personal and other information 
as follows:</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Provide Services.</u>  To provide 
our services, for example to deliver a message to the addresses or other 
destinations you have specified. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Communicate.</u>  Use your 
personal information to communicate with you generally, for example 
to respond to a query from you, or to provide you with updates or information 
concerning our services or the services of other companies that we believe 
you may be interested in. For information regarding opting out of some 
of these communications, please see "Your Choices" below.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Customization.</u>  To customize 
the advertising and content that you see on the Sites and in associated 
communications. For example, the Sites and associated communications 
from us may include targeted advertisements based on personal and other 
information. We do not provide any information to the advertiser or 
ad serving company that would personally identify you when you view 
or interact with a targeted ad, but advertisers and ad serving companies 
may assume that people who interact with or view targeted ads meet the 
targeting criteria. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Research.</u>  To improve our 
services we conduct research on how are services are used. For example, 
we may request that you complete user surveys, and use the resulting 
data to improve the Sites.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Improve Usability.</u>  We 
use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences 
and tracking user trends, such as how people use the Sites. We also 
use other Internet technology, as described above under "Information 
We Collect."</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria">We do not sell, share or disclose your 
contact information or personal information except to provide the services 
you request, when you give us permission, and in the following cases:</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Providing Services.</u>  Personal 
and other information is anonymously shared with our selected suppliers, 
service providers and partner sites in connection with providing services 
to you. For example, we may provide such information to third parties 
in connection with operating and maintaining the Sites, fulfilling your 
requests for services, processing credit card payments (if applicable), 
performing business and sales analysis, and offering contests or conducting 
surveys. We do not provide contact details to other companies for their 
marketing or mailing list unless you personally opt-in to other companies services.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Ad Targeting.</u>  Non-personally 
identifiable information is provided to third-party advertisers, and 
ad serving companies as described in the preceding section of this Privacy 
Policy ("How We Use The Information"). If you choose to interact 
with an advertisement on the Sites or in an associated communication 
from us, for example by clicking on an ad you will leave the Sites and 
your interactions with that third party will not be governed by this 
Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use. We do not control how any third 
party may collect, use, or disclose your personal or other information. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Content Sharing.</u>  Content 
(meaning any materials, including, without limitation, text, pictures, 
graphics, sound files and other files and the selection and arrangement 
thereof, the "Content") that you make available publicly on the 
Sites is generally displayed to other visitors to the Sites. Content 
that you make available publicly may be collected and used by others, 
and we cannot control what other users do with this Content. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Complying With The Law.</u>  We 
disclose personal and other information if we have a good-faith belief 
that the disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, 
legal process or an enforceable government request; to enforce applicable 
terms of use for our services; to detect, prevent or otherwise address 
illegal activity, fraud, or security issues; or to protect the property 
or safety of our users, JoMa, or the public as required or permitted 
by law.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Change of Control.</u>  In 
connection with a significant transaction involving JoMa, such as a 
merger or acquisition, we may transfer personal and other information 
to another party, but we will provide a notice before your personal 
information becomes subject to the privacy policy of another company.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Aggregate Data.</u>  We may 
share aggregated information with third parties, such as usage statistics 
or demographic trends regarding our users. This data does not include 
personal information.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><b>Your Choices</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria">As a user of the Sites you have the 
following options: </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Account Review.</u>  If you 
have an account with us, you can review and update your account information 
(such as your name and contact information) online by making the appropriate 
selections or changes. We make good faith efforts to provide you with 
access to your personal information and the ability to correct the information 
if it is inaccurate or to delete it at your request (if it is not required 
to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes). We require 
users to reliably identify themselves and the information they wish 
to access, correct, or remove before processing these requests, and 
we may decline to process requests that we believe in good faith are 
unreasonable or unduly burdensome (such as requests that are repetitive, 
require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of 
others, or would be impractical to satisfy).</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Service Review.</u>  You can 
add, edit, pause or remove services that you have subscribed to by logging 
into the Sites. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Deactivate Account.</u>  You 
can deactivate your account with us at any time by making the appropriate 
selections.  If you deactivate your account and later wish to reopen 
it and again receive services from us, you may be required to re-enter 
your account information and re-subscribe to any services you wish to 
receive. However, if you deactivate your account we may retain certain 
information associated with your account for recordkeeping. Further, 
we generally do not remove information that you have made publicly available, 
and information that has already been provided to third parties as described 
in this Privacy Policy may be retained by those third parties and will 
be subject to their policies, and not this Privacy Policy.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><u>Opt Out.</u>  If we propose 
to use personal information for any purposes other than those described 
in this Privacy Policy, we will offer you an effective way to opt out 
of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We do reserve 
the right to contact you on matters that we believe in good faith to 
be urgent or of particular importance even if you opt out from other 
communications, but these would not include marketing communications.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria"><b>Information Security</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Cambria">We take appropriate security measures 
to protect against unauthorized access to and unauthorized alteration, 
disclosure or destruction of personal information. These measures include 
administrative and physical security measures intended to guard against 
unauthorized access to personal data. No method of transmission over 
the Internet or method of electronic storage is one hundred percent 
secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable 
means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its 
absolute security.</font> <br></p>
