      <p>Effective Date: February 5, 2011</p>
      <p>Payvment takes your privacy very seriously and is committed to protecting your privacy and providing a means to allow you to safely make purchases on Facebook. This privacy statement describes how we collect and use the personal information you provide to Payvment. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and the steps you can take to access this information and to ensure that it is accurate.</p>
      <h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
      <p>We collect and retain the following personal information when you make a purchase: Contact information such as your name, email address and shipping address.</p>
      <p>We use the information we capture and collect to</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Facilitate your transaction with our retailer clients</li>
        <li>Retain your shipping information to pre-populate the form to make future product purchases easier.</li>
        <li>Retain items you placed in your shopping cart if you leave the cart before completing your purchase</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not use technologies such as cookies to track your activity on our application or to collect personal information from you.</p>
      <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
      <p>We will share your personal information with third parties (such as shipping details to the retailer to facilitate a purchase) only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
      <p>We may also disclose your personal information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process</li>
        <li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,</li>
        <li>if Payvment is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information,</li>
        <li>to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To help protect your privacy, we allow our retailer clients only limited access to your contact, shipping and financial information to facilitate your transactions. The use of your information is also subject to the retailer’s privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any retailer you choose to make purchases from.</p>
      <h2>PayPal</h2>
      <p>We use PayPal to collect and process payments. To complete your purchase, you will provide your credit card number, directly to PayPal. PayPal's privacy policy will apply to the information you provide on the PayPal website.</p>
      <h2>Correcting and Updating Your Personal Information</h2>
      <p>To revise or delete your saved shipping information, you can click the “Your Settings” button on the Facebook storefront.</p>
      <h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>
      <p>Our application includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Payvment’s. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is subject to their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit. If you post a comment or respond to a posting on a social network site, blog or Payvment fan page, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of those forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.</p>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.</p>
      <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
      <p>In order to make a purchase from us, you must use our payment provider to finalize and pay for your order. Its privacy statement and security practices will also apply to your information. We encourage you to read that privacy statement before providing your information.</p>

If we make any material changes to this policy that affect your personal information, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on our application prior to the change. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Questions/Feedback</p>
      <p>As an added step towards our commitment to your privacy, Payvment participates in the TRUSTe Privacy Seal Program, which requires members to fully disclose their information practices and undergo privacy compliance monitoring by TRUSTe.
