          <h4>LAST REVISED: May 21, 2018</h4>
          <p>Your privacy is important to us and we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users and the information that you share in connection with our Site. This Privacy Policy identifies: (i) what information we collect; (ii) how we process and manage such information; (iii) your rights with respect to the use and disclosure of the same. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy please contact us at support@listingstoleads.com. </p>
          <h3>1. PERSONAL DATA AND NON-PERSONAL DATA</h3>
          <p>a. <u>"Personal Data"</u> means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. </p>
          <p>b. <u>"Non-Personal Data"</u> means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Non-Personal Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Non-Personal Data, as described below.</p>
          <h3>2. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW DO WE USE IT?</h3>
          <p class="mb5">a. <u>What data is collected</u>.</p>
          <p>We collect Personal Data that you voluntarily provide us, for example, when you create an Account, register for our newsletter and/or make a purchase we may require your name, email, contact information, billing address, credit card inform and/or other information you may provide us. We also collect information about you from various sources, including from our landing page lead forms and other websites. We also may collect information about you that we receive from other sources (like public records), to enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database and to provide product recommendations and special offers that we think will interest you.</p>
          <p class="mb5">b. <u>Use of Personal Data</u>. <br> We will use your Personal Data to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Make the Site available to you;</li>
            <li>Process goods and services in connection with your use of the Site; </li>
            <li>Enhance the Site; </li>
            <li>Respond to your requests or to manage Accounts;</li>
            <li>Monitor the security of the Site; and/or</li>
            <li>Provide you with promotional communications. </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>3. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION </h3>
          <p>We disclose your Personal Data as described below and as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p class="mb5">a. <u>Third-Party Service Provides</u>.</p>
          <p>We will share your Personal Data with third parties, such as vendors and service providers who provide assistance with billing, payment processing, fraud protection, credit risk reduction, marketing, data analytics support and service associated with the Site and delivery of purchased merchandise.</p>
          <p class="mb5">b. <u>Compliance with laws and for other legitimate business purposes.</u></p>
          <p>We will share your Personal Data when we believe disclosure is necessary or required by law, regulation, to protect users, the integrity of the Site and to defend or exercise our legal rights. We may also disclose your Personal Data when it may be necessary for other legitimate purposes as reasonably determined by us.</p>
          <p class="mb5">c. <u>Affiliates</u>.</p>
          <p>We may share some or all of your Personal Data with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other company's under a common control ("Affiliates"), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p class="mb5">d. <u>Corporate restructuring</u>.</p>
          <p>We may share some or all of your Personal Data in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Data may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our Company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h3>4. NON-PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT </h3>
          <p class="mb5">a. <u>Information Collected by Our Servers</u>.</p>
          <p>To make our Site more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.</p>
          <p class="mb5">b. <u>Log Files</u>.</p> 
          <p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider ("ISP"), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Site to our users' needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve information appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automaticallycollected data to Personal Data.</p>
          <p class="mb5">c. <u>Cookies</u>. </p>
          <p>Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing the Site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive user experience. This type of information is collected to make our Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. </p>
          <p class="mb5">d. <u>Pixel Tags</u>. </p>
          <p>In addition, we use "Pixel Tags" (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to users. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to Personal Data.</p>
          <p class="mb5">e. <u>Flash LSOs</u>.</p>
          <p>When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as "Flash Cookies," to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash Cookies, <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
          <p class="mb5">f. <u>Google Analytics</u>.</p>
          <p>We may use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your Personal Data. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on Your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site and use Services, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our Site is governed by the Google Analytics' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. </p>
          <h3>5. California Privacy Rights</h3>
          <p>Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to request from a business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information with respect to the types of personal information the business shares with third parties for direct marketing purposes by such third party and the identities of the third parties with whom the business has shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year. </p>

          <h3>6. CALIFORNIA DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURE</h3>
          <p>Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When a user turns on the Do Not Track signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user. At this time, we do not recognize or respond to Do Not Track browser settings or signals and we will still receive information. As a result, we may still collect information about you and your internet activity, even if you have turned on the Do Not Track signal. </p>
          <p>It is possible that some or all of our third-party advertising partners or members of their affiliate network may participate in a consumer opt-out programs. To learn more about internetbased advertising and consumer opt-out programs go to <a href="http://aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">aboutads.info/choices/</a> or <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>. We do not operate or control these sites, and are not responsible for the opt-out choices available there. </p>
          <h3>7. YOUR U.K. PRIVACY RIGHTS</h3>
          <p>Users from the U.K. have the right to ask us to amend or limit the processing of their Personal Data, (as defined by U.K. law) and in particular not to process their Personal Data for marketing purposes. We will inform you (before collecting your personal data) if we intend to use your Personal Data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your Personal Data to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your rights to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your Personal Data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at: support@listingstoleads.com. </p>
          <p>The U.K. Data Protection Act 1998 ("the DPA 1998") gives users from the U.K. the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the DPA 1998. Any access request may be subject to a fee of Â£10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you. </p>
          <h3>8. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF INFORMATION </h3>
          <p>Information, including information collected in the European Economic Area ("EEA") may be transferred, stored and processed by us and our services providers in the United States and other countries whose data protection laws may be different than the laws of your country. We will protect your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed and take appropriate steps to protect the information in accordance with applicable laws. </p>

Since meeting this company about a year and a half ago, it has been nothing short of amazing seeing all the new enhancements they have made to the product! It seems as if they are adding them by the hour!!! Honestly this product makes running our business so easy - Blog support, Craigslist Support, Virtual Tours, Youtube uploads, Capture pages that are built automatically, property websites, search pages, etc. There are too many things to mention about this product - you have to try it out. They give you a 14 day trial so what is there to lose! They pull all the listings in for you so you don't have to do anything but click!! Anyway L2L is a great product and Scott and his team have done an amazing job with this product. Try it!!"

Here's my Top 4 favorite things about L2L and a 2 quick stories to demonstrate the awesomeness of this product: 1. Win more listings! - whenever I sit down with a potential seller part of my presentation is showing them the different marketing materials I produce with L2L and they are always impressed. L2L even gives you the ability to create pre-listing materials that feature the prospective clients home if you want to bring the Wow factor to the next level. 2. Generate Buyer Leads- L2L makes lead generation easy with their marketing tools with everything from their cleverly and carefully thought our verbiage to their landing pages that are specially designed to increase conversion. 3. Top Notch customer service- Scott and the rest of the L2L team provides some of the best customer service i've ever seen in the industry. They not only work hard to answer questions and resolve issues quickly, but they take it to the next level and then some by offering suggestions on how to use their tools to build your business. 4. Easy to use- The system is very easy to use and their is a very little learning curve to utilizing the L2L. Most of the time it is as simple of filling out a form and uploaing a few photos and all set with whole array of lead generating goodness! Creating landing pages are the only tricky part to figure out sometimes but once you get the hang of them they are pretty easy to use and if you ever get caught up their are training videos for just about everything you can imagine. Here's some recent L2L success I had: I recently had a rental listing and L2L helped to triple the income that I would normally receive from a listing a rental while getting my client more rent than they were asking for. Using their craiglist ad tool, I pushed people to the L2L single property website and landing pages. The first sunday it was available, i had back to back to back to back showings myself with prospective tenants and other agents also showing it to clients of theirs that saw the L2L marketing! The property rented for $100/month over asking price ($175/month over the last closed rental of same model). While I didnt double end the transaction, i was able to find two of the leads other homes. Utilizing L2L I was able to get my client more than they were asking for their home and turned one rental commission into 3 commissions equating to a commission similar to that of selling a home. All in all, this product is a win-win, both for your business and your clients, I would recommend this to any agent serious about getting maximum exposure for themselves and their listings."

          "reviewBody": "As the Director of Technology here at Keller Williams San Antonio I get to help make recommendations on products that may be useful for all of the agents (over 500 of them in my market center). Since meeting this company about a year and a half ago, it has been nothing short of amazing seeing all the new enhancements they have made to the product! It seems as if they are adding them by the hour!!! Honestly this product makes running our business so easy - Blog support, Craigslist Support, Virtual Tours, Youtube uploads, Capture pages that are built automatically, property websites, search pages, etc. There are too many things to mention about this product - you have to try it out. They give you a 14 day trial so what is there to lose! They pull all the listings in for you so you don't have to do anything but click!! Anyway L2L is a great product and Scott and his team have done an amazing job with this product. Try it!!"
