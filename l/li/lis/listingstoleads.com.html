Since meeting this company about a year and a half ago, it has been nothing short of amazing seeing all the new enhancements they have made to the product! It seems as if they are adding them by the hour!!! Honestly this product makes running our business so easy - Blog support, Craigslist Support, Virtual Tours, Youtube uploads, Capture pages that are built automatically, property websites, search pages, etc. There are too many things to mention about this product - you have to try it out. They give you a 14 day trial so what is there to lose! They pull all the listings in for you so you don't have to do anything but click!! Anyway L2L is a great product and Scott and his team have done an amazing job with this product. Try it!!"

Here's my Top 4 favorite things about L2L and a 2 quick stories to demonstrate the awesomeness of this product: 1. Win more listings! - whenever I sit down with a potential seller part of my presentation is showing them the different marketing materials I produce with L2L and they are always impressed. L2L even gives you the ability to create pre-listing materials that feature the prospective clients home if you want to bring the Wow factor to the next level. 2. Generate Buyer Leads- L2L makes lead generation easy with their marketing tools with everything from their cleverly and carefully thought our verbiage to their landing pages that are specially designed to increase conversion. 3. Top Notch customer service- Scott and the rest of the L2L team provides some of the best customer service i've ever seen in the industry. They not only work hard to answer questions and resolve issues quickly, but they take it to the next level and then some by offering suggestions on how to use their tools to build your business. 4. Easy to use- The system is very easy to use and their is a very little learning curve to utilizing the L2L. Most of the time it is as simple of filling out a form and uploaing a few photos and all set with whole array of lead generating goodness! Creating landing pages are the only tricky part to figure out sometimes but once you get the hang of them they are pretty easy to use and if you ever get caught up their are training videos for just about everything you can imagine. Here's some recent L2L success I had: I recently had a rental listing and L2L helped to triple the income that I would normally receive from a listing a rental while getting my client more rent than they were asking for. Using their craiglist ad tool, I pushed people to the L2L single property website and landing pages. The first sunday it was available, i had back to back to back to back showings myself with prospective tenants and other agents also showing it to clients of theirs that saw the L2L marketing! The property rented for $100/month over asking price ($175/month over the last closed rental of same model). While I didnt double end the transaction, i was able to find two of the leads other homes. Utilizing L2L I was able to get my client more than they were asking for their home and turned one rental commission into 3 commissions equating to a commission similar to that of selling a home. All in all, this product is a win-win, both for your business and your clients, I would recommend this to any agent serious about getting maximum exposure for themselves and their listings."
