Are Cookies?</b><br>Cookies are a feature of Web browser software
that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a
Web site. They are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's
Web browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can remember what
information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent
interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the
information to streamline the user's transactions on related Web
pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web
