                  <h1>list.ly Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
	By using list.ly (the “Website”), you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information 
	as described below.  We will notify all active accounts of any significant changes to this policy. 
</p>
<p>
	This website (<a href="http://list.ly" target="_blank">list.ly</a>) is owned and operated by Boomy Labs 
	We take user privacy seriously and make reasonable efforts to protect your privacy. 
	We have created this Privacy Policy in order to share with you our information collection and use practices. 
	Please read this policy carefully before sharing any personally identifiable information described below. 
	This policy applies solely to the Website located at <a href="http://list.ly" target="_blank">list.ly</a> (the Website).	
</p>

	<h2>What information does list.ly collect?</h2>
	 <p>
   In connection with your use of the Website, we ask for and may collect a variety of information from you in different ways. 
	 </p>
   <p>
    list.ly uses OAuth, an open protocol, as the method to interact with protected data 
    from Twitter and/or Facebook.  We do not have access to your Twitter or Facebook passwords.
   </p>
	 <p>In order to register or use certain portions of the Website, you may be  asked for, or you may choose to 
	 provide, certain personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, email address, postal  address, 
	 photo and similar information. We will not collect PII from  you while you use the Website unless you 
	 voluntarily provide it to us or authorize us to collect such information.
	 </p>
   <p>We collect and track certain non-personally identifiable  (non-PII) information, 
	 including but not limited to, user IP numbers and browser type, access times, domain names, usage 
	 habits and other information which does not specifically identify any individual.
   </p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
   <p>
    "Cookies" are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a website for the 
		purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with that website. We may use 
		cookies to  customize your use of the Website and for other purposes to improve  your use of the Website, 
		and may also use web beacons, web bugs, action  tags and third party cookies. You may stop or restrict 
		the placement of  cookies on your computer or flush them from your browser by adjusting  your web browser
		 preferences, in which case you may still use our  Website, but it may interfere with some of its functionality. 
		 We do not  use cookies to automatically retrieve PII from your computer without  your knowledge.
   </p>

<h2>Use of Your Information</h2>
    <p>
    list.ly may use or disclose PII to operate and manage the Website, to provide  services that you have requested or respond to your other 
		inquires or requests. We may also disclose PII in the establishment or exercise of legal rights or defense against legal claims, to comply 
		with applicable  laws or regulations, to comply with a valid legal process such as a  search warrant, subpoena or court order or to investigate 
		suspected fraud or a violation of list.ly's Terms of Service.
		</p>
		
		<p>We may share aggregated data and statistics in order to describe our Website and services to partners, advertisers and other 
		third parties for lawful purposes.
		</p>
		
    <p>
		Because list.ly enables people to interact and share crowd-sourced content using their Twitter or Facebook account, we share your Twitter and Facebook username and any social 
		interaction around your activity on list.ly.  This includes lists created, shared, or discussed on list.ly.

			 When we become aware that PII from a child under 13 has been collected without such child's parent or guardian's consent, we will use all 
			 reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.  We recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 18 ask and receive their parents' permission 
			 before using list.ly or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.
