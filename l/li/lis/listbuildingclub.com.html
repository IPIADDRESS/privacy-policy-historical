<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ELECTRONIC MEANS AND COOKIES<br>
</p>
<p> <br>
  We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you<br>
  when you visit many of the sections of the Website.  This non-personally<br>
  identifiable information includes, without limitation, the type of browser<br>
  that you use (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), your IP address, the type<br>
  of operating system that you use (e.g., Windows or Mac OS) and the domain<br>
  name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).<br>
  We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to<br>
  improve the design and content of the Website and to enable us to<br>
  personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in<br>
  the aggregate to analyze Website usage, as well as to offer you products<br>
  and services. We also reserve the right to use aggregate or group data<br>
  about our Visitors for any and all lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data<br>
  is data that describes the demographics, usage and/or characteristics of<br>
  our visitors as a group. By visiting and/or supplying your personal<br>
  information at the Website, you agree to allow us to provide such aggregate<br>
  data to third parties.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Cookies" is web jargon for bits of computer code placed on your hard<br>
  drive.  The Website uses cookies to keep you 'logged in,' to keep track of<br>
  search criteria, to monitor use, to password protect use of the Website<br>
  and/or to track use of products and/or services sold by and through the<br>
  Website.  Even in the case where a Visitor rejects a cookie, they may still<br>
  use our Website.  The only drawback to this is that the Visitor may be<br>
  limited in what he/she can access in some areas on our Website.  Cookies<br>
  can also be used to obtain information about your computer configuration or<br>
  your use of your computer.  To find out more about cookies, including how<br>
  to disable and/or remove cookies, please visit www.cookiecentral.com.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOW YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE USED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The personal information that you submit to us remains your property, but<br>
  by submitting such information to us you grant us the right, subject to<br>
  applicable state and federal law, to use the personal information (other<br>
  than credit card information) for marketing purposes.  Without limiting the<br>
  generality of the foregoing, we reserve the right to share, sell, rent,<br>
  lease and/or otherwise distribute any and all personal information with/to<br>
  any third-party for any and all uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and<br>
  applicable law.  These third parties may include, but shall not be limited<br>
  to: (a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including<br>
  lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (b)<br>
  e-mail marketers; (c) telemarketers (where permitted by applicable law);<br>
  (d) SMS text-based marketers (where permitted by applicable law); and (e)<br>
  direct marketers.  We may also use your personal information for any<br>
  promotion-related purpose, and/or marketing and survey purpose, on our own<br>
  behalf and on behalf of our affiliates and subsidiaries. We may disclose<br>
  personal information to third-party agents and independent contractors that<br>
  help us create and/or operate any promotions, surveys or other offerings.<br>
  You agree that we may contact you at any time with updates and/or any other<br>
  information that we may deem appropriate for you to receive in connection<br>
  with your continued use of the Website and any and all offerings made<br>
  available therein, or otherwise by the List Building Club.<br>
</p>
<p> <br>
  We are able to offer our products and services to you, in part, based on<br>
  your willingness to be reached by our third-party advertisers.  Your<br>
  personal information (other than credit card information) will be shared<br>
  with advertisers on an aggregate and non-aggregate basis.  We also use<br>
  contact information from your personal information to send you information<br>
  about us, our products and services and to contact you about your billing<br>
  account status.   Please keep in mind, though, that we do not control, and<br>
  are not responsible for, the practices of our third-party advertisers.  If<br>
  you wish to stop receiving future communications from us and/or third party<br>
  advertisers, or if you wish to prevent the transfer and/or sale of your<br>
  personal information to third parties (subject to restrictions contained in<br>
  applicable state and federal law), please see the Opt-Out/Unsubscribe<br>
  section below.<br>
  <br>
  You agree that by submitting your personal information to the List Building<br>
  Club, you agree to receive e-mail marketing from the List Building Club and<br>
  our third-party advertisers.  In addition, you agree that such act<br>
  constitutes a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application for purposes of<br>
  the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR §310 et seq. (the “ATSR”).<br>
  With respect to the ATSR, and notwithstanding that your telephone number<br>
  may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, we retain<br>
  the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the terms of<br>
  the ATSR.<br>
  <br>
  In addition, by submitting your personal information to the List Building<br>
  Club, you agree to receive mobile marketing including, but not limited to,<br>
  text-message based marketing, from us and our third party advertisers and<br>
  marketers (where, and to the extent that, such marketing is permitted by<br>
  applicable law).  As such, notwithstanding that your mobile telephone<br>
  number may be listed on state and/or federal Do-Not-Call registries, we<br>
  retain the right to contact you via text-message based marketing in<br>
  accordance with applicable state and federal law.  Further, you agree that<br>
  we reserve the right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise<br>
  distribute your mobile telephone and other mobile data with/to any<br>
  third-party for any and all non-marketing uses permitted by this Privacy<br>
  Policy and applicable law.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We reserve the right to release current or past personal information: (a)<br>
  in the event that we believe that the Website, and any products, services<br>
  or other offerings is/are being or has/have been used in violation of this<br>
  Privacy Policy, the List Building Club Terms of Use, List Building the Club<br>
  Purchase Agreement, or to commit unlawful acts; (b) if the information is<br>
  subpoenaed; or (c) if any entity comprising the List Building is sold or<br>
  acquired.  Moreover, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or<br>
  communication to any third-party when we, in our sole discretion, determine<br>
  the disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing<br>
  your e-mail address with other third-parties for suppression purposes in<br>
  compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time.<br>
  Visitors should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S.<br>
  Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to<br>
  permit personally identifiable information to be shared or transferred to<br>
  third parties without permission.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  We may also supplement the information we collect with information from<br>
  other sources to assist us in evaluating and improving the Website, our<br>
  products and/or services, and to determine your preferences so that we can<br>
  tailor the Website and our products and/or services to your needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CREDIT CARD INFORMATION<br>
</p>
<p> <br>
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not use your credit card information<br>
  for any marketing purposes, or transfer same to any third party, other than<br>
  as set forth in this paragraph.   The List Building Club may: (a) transfer<br>
  your credit card information to third party sellers where necessary to<br>
  effectuate the purchase of products and/or services that you requested on<br>
  the Website or otherwise from the List Building Club; (b) disclose your<br>
  credit card information pursuant to a court order, litigation and/or fraud<br>
  investigation; and (c) share with third parties the fact that we have<br>
  credit card information on file for specific individuals.<br>

<p> <br>
  INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS OR<br>

  <br>
  The Website may contain third party provided banners, pop-ups, hyperlinked<br>
  advertising and links to other third-party owned and/or operated websites.<br>
  The List Building Club is not responsible for the privacy practices<br>
  associated with such third party advertisers and/or websites.  In some<br>
  cases, you may be required to provide certain information to register or<br>
  complete a transaction via such advertisers and/or at such websites. These<br>
  third-party websites and advertisers have separate privacy and data<br>
  collection practices and the List Building Club has no responsibility or<br>
  liability relating to them.  We do not endorse, nor are we responsible for<br>
  the accuracy of, the privacy policies and/or terms and conditions of such<br>
  advertisers and/or websites.  These third party entities are independent<br>
  third parties and are not affiliated with us.<br>

  <br>
  DATA SECURITY <br>
  <br>
  All collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure<br>
  environment.  When our registration/application process asks users to enter<br>
  sensitive information (such as credit card number), and when we store and<br>
  transmit such sensitive information, it is encrypted and protected with SSL<br>
  encryption software.  While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive<br>
  information online, we also do everything in our power to protect sensitive<br>
  information and other personal information off-line.  Unfortunately, no<br>
  data transmission over the Internet, or otherwise, can be guaranteed to be<br>
  100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your sensitive<br>
  information and other personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the<br>
  security of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your<br>
  own risk.</p>
<p>Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure its<br>
  security on our systems. Access to this personal information is strictly<br>
  limited, and not accessible to the public.  All of our users’ personal<br>
  information, not just sensitive information, is restricted in our offices.<br>
  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are<br>
  granted access to personal information.  Our employees are dedicated to<br>
  ensuring the security and privacy of all List Building Club user personal<br>
  information.  Employees not adhering to our written firm policies are<br>
  subject to disciplinary action.  In compliance with applicable federal and<br>
  state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in<br>
  the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to<br>
  your personal information.  You will be notified via e-mail in the event of<br>
  such a breach.  Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to<br>
  address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network<br>
  damage, and to engage in remedial measures.<br>
