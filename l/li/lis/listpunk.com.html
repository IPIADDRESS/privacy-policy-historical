<b>2)&nbsp;<u>How We Use The Information That We Collect</u></b><br>
&nbsp;<ul>
	<li>We use account information (Name, username, password &amp; Internet Protocol 
	Address) to enable use to provide a login area where you can manage your own 
	advertising and store the information about what adverts you have purchased 
	and have available including account balances.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>We use the information regarding transactions (Date, Time, Email Address 
	Used, Purchased Item Information and Payment Method Used) to process your 
	transactions and to keep a log of what you have purchased in the past in 
	case of any discrepancies you may have about what you have purchased. We 
	also use this information to enable us to see what items sell well and 
	improve on our best products and offerings.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>We use your email address to validate and confirm that you are the 
	account holder and so that you can click the opt in verification link to 
	give your approval of us contacting you via email. This helps us keep you 
	informed, send details of purchases for your records and also to verify the 
	account holder for security reasons. We also promote other products and 
	services (both supplied or provided by us or by third parties) to you via 
	email but we do so from emails sent directly from our system only and do not 
	share or distribute your email address with others. (See the "Linking to 
	other websites" section below)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Automated cookies and web beacons are used for tracking purposes to see 
	where members have come from and also to keep session information to make 
	sure that certain ads are only delivered once per session and not every page 
	load. This helps us improve our services to you and avoid over advertising 
	to you to create a more pleasurable experience.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<b>3)&nbsp;<u>How We Share The Information That We Collect</u></b><br>
&nbsp;<ul>
	<li>We do not share your email address with any third parties and never sell 
	member information. We do allow third parties to advertise using our 
	services and we do promote other services to you via email but all 
	promotions are delivered from our systems and no personal information is 
	shared with them from us. You may share information with them if you join 
	their site or purchase their services.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>We may provide information including Name, Email Address and Internet 
	Protocol (IP) Addresses to both payment processors and or law enforcement if 
	requested to do so by law and or the terms of purchasing using their 
	services to help with any investigation or information request they need to 
	conduct lawful business.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>We may use your information in our other businesses but all 
	communication will come via the account and system that you signed up for 
	and not from our other services unless you register there and give separate 
	permission there.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Any information collected by third party apps or plugins including but 
	not limited to Facebook like buttons etc is picked up from your actions and 
	not from our system by the way you interact with such services and therefore 
	you are using their service and run under their privacy policies.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>As the information collected is used to run the website and the website 
	collects the information should the website and or business be sold the 
	information will pass over to the new business or website owner but remain 
	intact in the confines of the site. The new owner will be as part of any 
	deal required to comply and follow this privacy policy until notifying you 
	of any changes.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

	email address. Failure to verify within 7 days will result in account 
	deletion and all information held being erased automatically.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>You can unsubscribe and remove your account yourself at any time. All 
	emails from us excluding the welcome email have an unsubscribe link which 
	will enable you to click and remove your account. You can also do this from

	This will cancel any future use of your information and remove your account 
	from our system.<br>

<b>5)&nbsp;<u>Your Right To View, Edit &amp; Delete Personal Information</u></b><br>

	for accounting and tax purposes only.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>You may also request to see all the information we hold for you but we 
	will require you to prove your identity before we can provide that 
	information. This is done for data security and privacy reasons and if we 
	are not sure that you are the person the information requested is for then 
	we reserve the right to withhold that provision until such times as we can 
	be certain by requesting more proof.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>To request the information we hold on you or to get us to delete or edit 
	your information please submit a&nbsp;<font color="black"><a target="_self" href="http://hoganwebsolutions.com/support"><u><font color="#0000FF">support

	reply to that ticket requesting further proof of your identity to ensure we 
	only give the information to you.<br>
