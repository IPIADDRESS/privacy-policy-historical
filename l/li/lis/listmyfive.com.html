        <br>
        <h3 class="TxtOrange">
            Effective Date: June 22, 2010
        </h3>
        <p>
            ListMyFive is strongly committed to protecting your privacy and providing a safe
            online experience for all our users. This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") discusses
            the personally identifying information ("PII") that we collect about you through
            ListMyFiveâ€™s website, which includes all of the ListMyFive.com Lists and other services
            we provide on the website (collectively, the "Site"). Please read the complete Policy
            below and contact us if you have any questions. This Policy is part of and incorporated
            into the Terms of Use of the Site. If you are not comfortable with this Privacy
            Policy or our Terms of Use, please do not provide us with PII or other information
            or content or otherwise use the Site.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="TxtOrange">
            1. What information may be collected by ListMyFive, and how is it collected? Type
            of Information We Collect.
        </h3>
        <p>
            We collect any information you enter on the Site or give us in any other way (such
            as through an email, survey, or letter). The information that we collect varies
            depending upon how you use our Site. For example, our account registration process
            requires that you provide us with your user name, birthday and email address, and
            that you create and provide us with a password. We may also request other information,
            such as but not limited to, your actual first and last name, gender, and zip code.
            You may make changes, corrections, or updates to some PII provided through this
            Site which we use for communications with you, by visiting your account homepage
            on the ListMyFive website. We may keep a record of all information that is changed
            (including deletions) and Disclose it for any lawful purpose. We may determine what
            may be changed (e.g., if we are required to keep track of certain kinds of transactions,
            you may not change relevant information).</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="TxtOrange">
            2. Information in Public Areas of the Site.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily provide information in public
            areas of the Site, such as the user profile pages or forums, that information can
            be viewed and possibly used by others. We therefore advise visitors not to disclose
            contact information, including phone number, email address, street address or instant
            messenger address (within these public areas) that they do not wish to share. We
            are not responsible for PII you choose to submit in these public areas. Also, we
            may highlight content you post to the public areas of the Site such as reviews or
            comments, such as by featuring your content on the Site's home page.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="TxtOrange">
            3. Minors.
        </h3>
        <p>
            We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the
            age of 14 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 14, do not
            attempt to register for our Site or send any information about yourself to us. We
            recommend that prospective users between the ages of 14 and 17 ask their parents
            or other legal guardians for permission before sending any information about themselves
            to anyone over the Internet.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="TxtOrange">
            4. Cookies.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Like many websites, we use "cookies." Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that
            we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our
            systems to recognize your browser. We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember
            your information and to link your activities to you. While you can take steps to
            warn off, block or disable cookies, if you do, the Site may not function and appear
            as we have designed it. Nonetheless, if you want to take these steps, you can do
            so by following the instructions associated with your browser. Our cookies do not
            collect PII that you provide to us during the registration process, but they do
            collect other information such as the following:</p>
        <ol class="OrderList ML60 MT10">
            <li>the domain name and host from which you access the Internet and the Internet address
                of the site from which you direct-linked to ours;</li>
            <li>the date and time you access the Site and pages you visit;</li>
            <li>your computer's IP address and information about its operating system, platform
                and the Web browser type and version you use;</li>
            <li>demographic and other non-personally identifiable profile information about you;
                and</li>
            <li>information to combat fraud or misuse.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3 class="TxtOrange">
            5. Pixel Tags.
        </h3>
        <p>
            In our emails to you, we may use "pixel tags" to determine if your email software
            or service can display html-formatted email (this helps us optimize the size of
            our email messages and conserve bandwidth).</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="TxtOrange">
            6. Collection of Information by Third Parties.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Our Site may include third-party advertising, links to other websites, and other
            content from third party businesses. The content posted by these parties will be
            reasonably identifiable as coming from a third party. We do not provide any PII
            to these advertisers, third-party websites, or other businesses, although on occasion
            we may mutually share non-personally identifiable (e.g., demographic) information
            to facilitate delivery of relevant advertisements. These third-party websites, businesses,
            and advertisers, or advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use
            technology to deliver (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our Site directly
            to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They
            may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel
            gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize
            or optimize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies
            or other technologies that they may use, and the information practices of these
            advertisers and third-party websites or businesses are not covered by this Policy
            but are covered by their respective privacy policies. Some, but not all, third party
            advertising companies provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="TxtOrange">
            7. Promotions, Sweepstakes, and Contests.
        </h3>
        <p>
            From time to time, we may host a promotion, sweepstake, or contest on the Site.
            You may be asked to provide personal information or permit the transfer to a third
            party of your personal information in connection with such promotion, sweepstake
            or contest. It will be disclosed at the point of collection or transfer who is collecting
            or transferring the information and whose privacy statement applies, and it will
            be your choice whether or not you wish to permit such transfer or collection of
            personal information to a third party.</p>
        <ol class="OrderList ML60 MT10">
            <li>What Does ListMyFive Do With Collected Information? Use of PII. We use your PII
                for purposes such as responding to your requests, monitoring and providing the Site,
                maintaining your account, providing you with advertising and nonadvertising content
                that we believe would be of interest to you, enforcing our rights and the rights
                of third parties, and investigating and ensuring compliance with the Terms of Use.
                We also may use your PII to contact you regarding your account, such as to inform
                you that you have received a message from another member, or to forward user comments
                to you about the content that you have posted. We may also email newsletters, and
                similar communications about the Site.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3 class="TxtOrange">
            8. Opting-Out.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Users can unsubscribe from any newsletters or opt out of various promotional e-mailings
            at any time by sending an e-mail to the same address, or by clicking on "unsubscribe"
            links in each of our newsletters or emails. We reserve the right to send you customary
            business communications such as acceptance/rejection notices regarding content submissions,
            general system and administrative messages regarding the Site, address confirmations,
            and transactional information about your account, and we may not offer you the opportunity
            to opt-out of receiving such communications so long as you are registered with the
            Site.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="TxtOrange">
            9. Use of Other Information.
        </h3>
        <p>
            We use non-PII about our users for purposes such as measuring the number of visitors
            to sections of our Site, making the Site more useful to visitors and delivering
            targeted advertising and non-advertising content. We use IP addresses to analyze
            trends, administer the Site, track a user's movement, and gather broad demographic
            information for aggregate, non-personally identifiable use.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="TxtOrange">
            10. Retention of Information.
        </h3>
        <p>
            We retain information for as long as required, allowed or we believe it useful,
            but do not undertake retention obligations. We may dispose of information in our
            discretion without notice, subject to applicable law that specifically requires
            the handling or retention of information. You must keep your own, separate back-up
            records.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="TxtOrange">
            11. Generally.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Subject to the terms of this Policy, we reserve the right to the following worldwide:
            use, access (or bar access to), process, disclose, display, share, transfer, store,
            sell, retain, commingle, investigate, verify, prove, and otherwise deal with, voluntarily
            or as required by law, (collectively "Disclose") all PII, non-PII and other information.
            We may Disclose the foregoing internally to third parties or through any databases
            for any purpose not prohibited by this Policy or, in our discretion, to help prevent
            or address perceived harm, damage or loss to us or others or to respond to subpoenas,
            search warrants, court orders, or other legal process. We reserve the right to send
            you customary business communications (i.e. acceptance/rejection notices regarding
            content submissions, general system and administrative messages, address confirmations,
            transactional information about your Account, etc.) without offering you the opportunity
            to opt-out of receiving them. However, we provide you with the opportunity to elect
            not to receive these or other types of communications.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="TxtOrange">
            12. Does ListMyFive Share Information With Other Parties?
        </h3>
        <br>
        <h3 class="TxtOrange">
            13. We share information with third parties, but only as described in this Section
            3.
        </h3>
        <ol class="OrderList ML60 MT10">
            <li>Advertisers and Others.
                <p>
                    We share non-personally identifiable information with advertisers, service providers,
                    and other persons with whom we conduct business. Similarly, these advertisers, service
                    providers, and other persons may share with us non-PII about you that they have
                    independently gathered or acquired.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Third Party Services.
                <p>
                    We contract with affiliated and non-affiliated third parties to provide services
                    to us or to you on our behalf. Examples include providing marketing assistance,
                    providing customer service, sending emails to you, removing repetitive information
                    from customer lists, and analyzing data. These third parties may have access to
                    your PII for use solely in connection with these authorized business activities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Business Transfer.
                <p>
                    As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets, or
                    engage in acquisitions, mergers, restructuring, changes of control, or similar transactions.
                    In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business
                    assets, and your PII may be subject to such a transfer. Also, in the unlikely event
                    of a bankruptcy, customer information may be transferred to a bankruptcy trustee
                    or debtor in possession and then to a subsequent purchaser.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Affiliates.
                <p>
                    We may share PII, non-PII and other information with our corporate affiliates. Some
                    of our most significant affiliates are identified on the website of our parent company,
                    Corporate affiliates are those entities that we control, are controlled by us, or
                    are under common control with us and any joint venture in which any of the controlled
                    entities may participate from time to time. Any use of your information by our corporate
                    affiliates is subject to this Policy or another policy no less protective of your
                    privacy. Conversely, we may obtain information about you from our corporate affiliates
                    or from your visits to other websites that we or our corporate affiliates control.</p>
            </li>

            a shared computer. Your emails to us are not necessarily secure against interception
            so do not include sensitive information in them. We generally will not ask for passwords
            in an email and you should assume that if you get such a request, it might be fraudulent.
            YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU REASONABLY CAN TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.

        </h3>
        <p>
            We take reasonable precautions to protect the security of our users' information.
            We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent
            unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information.
            However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption
            systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail
            to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your PII,
            we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaim-able
            duty to protect your PII, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards
            used to measure our compliance with that duty.
