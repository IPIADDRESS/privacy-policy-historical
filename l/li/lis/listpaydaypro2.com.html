privacy is very important to us. &nbsp;We have created this Privacy Policy to 
demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy 
describes how our company collects information from all end users of our 
Internet services (the "Services")-those who access some of our Services but do 
not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who may purchase Products and/or 
pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members")-what we do 
with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have 
concerning the collection and use of such information. We request that you read 
this Privacy Policy carefully.&nbsp;<br class="kix-line-break"><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Personal 
Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;"><br class="kix-line-break"><br class="kix-line-break">Introduction. Our company collects 
information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various 
parts of our Services and the network of Web sites accessible through our 
Service.&nbsp;<br class="kix-line-break"><br class="kix-line-break">It is our company's 
policy to use or share the personal information about Visitors or Members in 
ways described herein without additional notice or means to opt out or otherwise 
prohibit such unrelated uses.&nbsp; </span><br><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">Also, 
we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information 
regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, 
for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to 
do so, including: credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant database 
agencies, law enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic 
Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or 
governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information 
that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone 
who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, or other 
user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect our company and 
our Members.&nbsp; </span><br><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">This 
privacy policy identifies the categories of personally identifiable information 
that our company collects through our Web site or online service, about 
individual consumers who use or visit our company's commercial Web site or 
online service and the categories of third-party persons or entities with whom 
our company may share that personally identifiable information.<br class="kix-line-break"><br class="kix-line-break">Our company does not maintain a 
process for an individual consumer who uses or visits our commercial Web site or 
online service to review and request changes to any of his or her personally 
identifiable information that is collected through our Web site or online 
service.<br class="kix-line-break"><br class="kix-line-break">See the section below 
entitled "Revisions To This Policy" for a description of the process by which 
our company notifies consumers who use or visit our commercial Web site or 
online service of material changes to our company's privacy policy for this Web 
site or online service.</span><br><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;"></span><br><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">Registration:&nbsp; 
Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up 
for our Products or Services including name, address, telephone number, billing 
information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer 
being used to access the Services. The personal information collected from 
Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account 
(such as for billing purposes). This information may be shared with third 
parties, as stated herein, or in special circumstances. </span><br><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">&nbsp;However, 
in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our Services, we 
may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, 
and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint 
promotion for the purpose of offering you other products and services. 
</span><br><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">We 
may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal 
information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but 
not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this 
aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on 
the Services.&nbsp;</span><br><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">Also, 
with purchases, we supply our member's contact information, to our business 
partners, who then may contact the member by telephone after the member 
purchase. Sales proceeds are collected by the that business partner company.&nbsp; We 
also may supply other companies with contact information, for mail offers we 
believe would be of interest to our members, with or without compensation from 
those companies.&nbsp; At times we may send an advertisement for a third party 
product, where we collect the sales proceeds, and forward the purchaser's 
information to that third party. </span><br><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">Our 
Company Partners and Sponsors:&nbsp; Some products and services may be offered to 
Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor 
seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members some of these 
products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal 
information.&nbsp; </span><br><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">Online 
Shopping:&nbsp; At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or register 
to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new product and service 
updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as 
your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card 
information.&nbsp; </span><br><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">If 
you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent 
directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the 
recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone number. Our company 
has no control over the third parties' use of any personal information you 
provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so.&nbsp;<br class="kix-line-break"><br class="kix-line-break">If you order services or products 
directly from our company, we use the personal information you provide to 
process that order.&nbsp; We do share this information with outside parties that we 
do business with. </span><br><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">Online 
Advertisements:&nbsp; Our company may display online advertisements. In those cases 
we share information about our Visitors and Members collected through the 
registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these 
advertisers.&nbsp; </span><br><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">Additionally, 
in some instances, we use this information to deliver tailored advertisements or 
joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us 
the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the 
audience. Based upon the information we have collected, we may then display or 
send the advertisement to the intended audience. Our company does share personal 
information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers or joint 
venture companies.<br class="kix-line-break"><br class="kix-line-break">Responses to 
Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to our company, 
the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive.&nbsp;<br class="kix-line-break"><br class="kix-line-break">Voluntary Customer Surveys:&nbsp; We 
may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We 
encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us 
with important information that helps us to improve the types of products and 
services we offer and how we provide them to you.&nbsp;</span><br><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">We 
may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer 
Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we 
may have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as 
gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or 
other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to 
improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and 
products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared 
with third parties.</span><br><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">Promotions:&nbsp; 
Our company may offer polls, contests, sweepstakes, drawings, games, content, or 
other promotions that are sponsored by or cobranded with third parties. You may 
be entered in a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, simply by making a 
purchase from us or by providing us with personally identifiable information for 
some other reason or purpose. Due to these third party relationships, the third 
parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily 
submit to our company. Our company has no control over third parties' use of 
this information.&nbsp;<br class="kix-line-break"><br class="kix-line-break">Additionally, personally identifiable information may be 
collected when you order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise 
express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online 
newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The 
types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these 
pages include but may not be limited to: name, address, e-mail address, 
telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about 
your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. Our 
sponsors or third parties may send you material that relates to our company's 
services, products or activities.<br class="kix-line-break"><br class="kix-line-break">The effective date of this privacy policy is listed at the
