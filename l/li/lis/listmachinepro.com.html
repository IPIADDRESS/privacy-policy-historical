<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>With whom may the information may be shared?</strong></p>
<p>We may share aggregated information about our Visitors, including the demographics of our Visitors and Authorised Customers, with our affiliated agencies and third party vendors. We also offer the opportunity to “opt out” of receiving information or being contacted by us or by any agency acting on our behalf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain information about the preferences of our Visitors and the services they select. We also use Cookies for security purposes.

<p>All of our employees are familiar with our security policy and practices. The Personally Identifiable Information of our Visitors and Authorised Customers is only accessible to a limited number of qualified employees who are given a password in order to gain access to the information. We audit our security systems and processes on a regular basis.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information collected by the Site?</strong></p>
<p>We provide Visitors and Authorised Customers with a mechanism to delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site’s database by contacting us. However, because of backups and records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor’s entry without retaining some residual information. An individual who requests to have Personally Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information functionally deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</strong></p>
<p>We will let our Visitors and Authorised Customers know about changes to our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, if we are changing our privacy policy in a manner that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that a Visitor or Authorised Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we will contact such Visitor or Authorised Customer to allow such Visitor or Authorised Customer to prevent such disclosure.</p>
