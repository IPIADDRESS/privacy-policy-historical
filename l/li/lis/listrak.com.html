  <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
  <p>Listrak collects information at several different points on our web site in order to better serve client and visitor needs. For each visitor to our web pages, our web server automatically recognizes and collects only the visitor's domain name or IP address, aggregate information on what pages visitors access, information volunteered by the visitor, such as name, email, phone and company information, email address related to permission-based subscription to our email alerts, e-newsletters, and promotional emails, and logins to access portions of the site related to their Listrak account. </p>
  <p>The information we collect is used to send you requested product or Service information, respond to questions, concerns and customer support inquiries, send you emails, and create demographic profiles of our subscribers, clients, and visitors so we can improve the content of our web site and email alerts. </p>
  <p>We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name and company information. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us using the information below. </p>
  <h4>Information Related to Data Collected through the Listrak Services</h4>
  <p>Under the direction of our clients, Listrak collects lists of data including personal email addresses of third parties with the purpose of delivering permission-based email campaigns to those lists. Listrak hosts these client lists on our servers. We have no ownership of this information or any direct relationship with individuals whose personally identifiable information may be processed as part of providing our Services. </p>
  <p>An individual who seeks access to their data, seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data or wishes to opt-out of communications from a Listrak Client should direct his/her query to the Listrak client he/she interacts with directly (the data controller). If a Listrak client requests that we remove personally identifiable information on their behalf, we will respond to their request within 30 days. </p>
  <p>Listrak may transfer personal information to other companies that help us provide our Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the Service agreements with our clients. </p>
  <p>Listrak will retain personal data we process on behalf of our clients for as long as needed to provide Services and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. </p>
  <p>Clients who use the Services offered on our Site may submit the personal information of other individuals at their organization to register them as authorized users and/or Account Associates. It is the client's obligation, as the data controller, to inform its authorized users about the purposes for which information about them is collected and may be used on this Service. Authorized users may update or remove their account information by logging into the Services platform and editing their account information, or by contacting their administrator. </p>
  <h4>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h4>
  <p>Listrak will never use, sell, share, disclose, or rent any internal or customer supplied data to any clients, prospects, or other third parties. Listrak is not an email list rental Service. Our clients retain ownership and control of their lists at all times. </p>
  <p>Our hosted application works in concert with this privacy policy to ensure that no sharing or disclosure of list data including personal information can occur between clients or third parties. Listrak is contractually bound with each of our clients to maintain the privacy and integrity of their campaign data to include all personal information, tracking data, and analytical data. </p>
  <p>We may provide personal information to companies that provide Services to help us with our business activities such as offering customer Service and processing payments. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these Services to us and are contractually obligated to keep your information confidential. </p>
  <p>We may also disclose personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. </p>
  <p>If Listrak is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information, </p>
  <h4>User Access and Choice</h4>
  <p>If your personal information changes, you may correct, update, amend, remove, or ask to have it removed by making the change on your user account settings page, by emailing our Customer Support Team at support@listrak.com or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. If you no longer desire our Service, please contact us directly. We will respond to your request within 24 hours. </p>
  <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you Services and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. </p>
  <h4>Opting Out</h4>
  <p>If you wish to subscribe to our email alerts, e-newsletters, and promotional communications, we will use your name and email address to send them to you. Out of respect for your privacy, if you no longer wish to receive Listrak's email alerts, e-newsletters, and promotional communications, you can easily opt-out using the Unsubscribe link included in each communication, reply to the email requesting to be removed from the list, contact us at privacy@listrak.com, or call 877.362.4556. </p>
  <h4>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h4>
  <p>Some of our web pages, and some of our partners and clients, utilize cookies and other tracking technologies, such as a single pixel gif, to record session information. </p>
  <p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. The following cookies are in use: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>ASP.Net Session Cookie: This is a cookie used by ASP.Net to track session data. This cookie holds a SessionID which is used to track a user after they have logged into the Listrak application. That SessionID is used for security, access checks and ownership, and site customization. This is a session cookie and will be disposed when a user closes their browser.</li>
    <li>Classic ASP Session Cookie: This is a cookie which performs the same function as the ASP.Net session cookie, but used by our legacy code.</li>
    <li>Client Authorization Cookie: This cookie is used to track Client Authorization. This is a security mechanism to validate a user based on their machine. Once validated, a cookie will be created to avoid having to validate again. This is a persistent cookie and is set to expire 60 days after creation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited. </p>
  <p>We employ a software technology called single-pixel gifs (a.k.a. web beacons). Single-pixel gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online activity of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, single-pixel gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Listrak uses single-pixel gif images to count web page accesses and gather some general statistical information such as if an email has been opened or read. Collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share your profile with other third parties. </p>
  <p>The use of tracking technologies by our Service providers, technology partners or other 3rd party assets (such as social media) on the site is not covered by our privacy policy. These 3rd parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our site. We do not have access or control over these technologies. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers' or Users' personally identifiable information. </p>
  <h4>Online Advertising / Behavioral Targeting</h4>
  <p>We partner with a third party ad network to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank">clicking here</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads. </p>
  <h4>Confidentiality and Security</h4>
  <p>Listrak warrants that all customer data remains the property of our customers. We also will not use, rent, sell, transfer, or otherwise expose the contents of the tracking information resulting from click through, message opened, message read, or eCommerce conversions. </p>
  <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Listrak provides an SSL encrypted, password-protected mechanism for logging in, viewing and extracting client data on our Services Platform. Listrak maintains all client data in a carrier-class secure facility protected by firewalls and other security devices. These measures are designed to protect visitor and client information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our web site, you can contact us at privacy@listrak.com. </p>
  <p>We restrict access to this information to only those employees who require the information for business purposes. </p>
  <h4>Links to Other Web Sites</h4>
  <p>Listrak's web site, or messages created with Listrak, may contain links to other web sites. Listrak is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other web sites. Third parties may independently collect information about web site visitors when they view ads or other communications from third parties through Listrak products or Services. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. If visitors do not want those companies to collect information about them, they should contact these companies directly. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any web site you visit. </p>
  <h4>Blog</h4>
  <p>Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. <em>To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:marketing@listrak.com">marketing@listrak.com</a></em>.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
  <h4>Social Media Features</h4>
  <p>Our web site includes social media features, such as links to our Facebook, Tumblr, LinkedIn and Twitter pages. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. </p>
  <h4>Unsolicited Commercial Email (SPAM)</h4>
  <p>Listrak is committed to providing a permission-based model for email marketing. To that end, we carry a strict anti-spam policy for all of our clients. Listrak clients are explicitly prohibited from sending any unsolicited material to recipients who have not expressed their permission to receive communications from them. Additionally, Listrak Services may only be used for lawful purposes and may not violate any local, state, federal or international laws. </p>
  <p>These policies are part of our broader reaching Acceptable Use Policy that each of our clients are contractually bound to. Violation of this policy will lead to a speedy termination of all access to the Listrak application, servers, and network. </p>
  <h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. We will notify clients and subscribers via email if we make any changes to our privacy policy, and we will post the changes on our site at least fifteen (15) days prior to its taking effect. If at any point we decide to use personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify subscribers and ask them for permission before using their personal data. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. </p>
