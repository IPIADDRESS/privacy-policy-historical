        What Personal Data Does Muck Rack Collect?
    </h2>
    <p>
        During your use of the Service or through other communications with Muck Rack, personal data may be collected and processed by Muck Rack.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Information Collected by “Cookies”:</strong> When you access the Service, we may send one or more “cookies” to your computer. A “cookie” is a small line of text that is stored with your browser, which we use to help provide better service to you. Your browser has options to accept, reject or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. We may use cookies for many purposes, including (without limitation) to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit the Service, and to deliver content (which may include third party advertisements) specific to your interests.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Log File Information:</strong> Our servers automatically record certain information that your browser sends whenever you access the Service.

    </h2>
    <p>
        Any personal information that you voluntarily disclose online (in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, through a User Submission, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have not opted out from receiving marketing communications from us, we may use your email address, phone number or other personal data to send commercial or marketing messages. We also may use your email address, phone number and other personal data for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Service changes or for customer service purposes). You cannot opt out of receiving communications for non-marketing or administrative purposes without discontinuing your use of the service.
    </p>
    <p>
        With regard to non-personal data, we use aggregated information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Service and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends. In addition, we may use "cookies," clear gifs and log file information to deliver content (which may include third party advertisements) specific to your interests, and remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Service.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Will Muck Rack Share Personal Data with Others?
    </h2>
    <p>
        We will not share your personal data with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may provide personal data to Muck Rack employees, consultants, affiliates or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. In such circumstances, we require that these parties agree to protect the confidentiality of such information and to comply in all respects with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may share non-personal data (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, we may release personal data: (i) to the extent we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with any applicable law, enforce any provision of the Terms of Service, protect ourselves against any liability, defend ourselves against any claims, protect the rights, property and personal safety of any user or protect the public welfare; or (ii) to respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.
    </p>
    <h2>
        International Data Transfer
    </h2>
    <p>
        For individuals in Switzerland and the European Union (EU), please note that Muck Rack is a US based company.  If you use the Service, all information, including personal information, will be transferred to Muck Rack (including third parties to which data was disclosed as described above) in the United States and any information made public via our website may be viewed by individuals located anywhere in the world.

By using the Service, you unambiguously consent to the transfer of your personal information and other information to the United States and elsewhere for the purposes and uses described herein.
    </p>
    <h2>
        EU Data Privacy Rights
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you are located in the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation grants you certain rights under the law. In particular, the right to access, correct, or delete the personal data Muck Rack holds about you.  Muck Rack will retain your data for the length of time you engage with Muck Rack’s services until you request deletion of such personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Upon request, Muck Rack will grant individuals reasonable access to personal data that it holds about them. In addition, Muck Rack will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information it holds about them. Muck Rack also relies upon each individual to assist in providing accurate updates of his or her personal data. In order to access, correct, amend, or delete the personal data Muck Rack holds about an individual, the individual should contact <a href="mailto:privacy@muckrack.com">privacy@muckrack.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have a comment, question, or complaint about how Muck Rack is handling your personal data, we hope that you contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@muckrack.com">privacy@muckrack.com</a> in order to allow us to resolve the matter.  In addition, individuals located in the EU may submit a complaint regarding the processing of their personal data to the EU data protection authorities (DPAs).

    <h2>
        Publication of Data
    </h2>
    <p>
        Muck Rack publishes data and information on its website based on two concepts.  First, Muck Rack believes that publication of this data is in the public interest, and, therefore, we exercise the right to freedom of expression in order to fulfill this public interest.   Further, the information compiled here was obtained from the public domain, or it can be assumed that the nature of the information is such that publication does not  expose any individual to unjustified harm.  Second, Muck Rack publishes data and information based on its legitimate interest to provide the Service, and by providing the Service, no unwarranted harm is caused to any individual and the nature of the published information is such that the interests of the individual do not outweigh Muck Rack’s legitimate interest. That said, if a individual has questions or concerns about the information made available through Muck Rack, we encourage you to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@muckrack.com">privacy@muckrack.com</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Third Party Advertisers
    </h2>
    <p>
        We may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Service. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. This Privacy Policy does not apply to them, and we cannot control their activities.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Is My Information Secure?
    </h2>
    <p>
        We have implemented security measures to protect personal data collected on the Service against loss, misuse or alteration. In addition, your account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. It is important that you protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer. Moreover, despite the precautions described above, we cannot and do not guarantee that the individual user information you have transmitted will not be intercepted by others and/or decrypted or accidentally disclosed, and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure.
