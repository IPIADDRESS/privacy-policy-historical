		Privacy Policy		</h2>
		<div class="Section1">
		
		  <p>		    Your privacy is important to us. Limeade,  Inc. (“Limeade,” “our,” “us” and “we”) has created this Privacy Policy (“Privacy  Policy”) to inform users (“you” or “your”) and other visitors to our website  about what information we collect about you and about your use of our website.  It explains how we protect that information and what choices you have about how  it is used. We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you will  understand clearly both our commitment to you and your privacy, and how we may  collect and use information. By using the Limeade website, you are agreeing to  the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
		  <p><strong>Please remember that any information  (including personal and medical information) that you reveal in a Limeade public  forum (such as a web chats, blogs and community forums) is not protected by  this Privacy Policy. Third parties not related to Limeade will see such  postings. What you've written could be used by others in ways we are unable to  control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes. Also,  in accessing a third party website from a link or search tool on Limeade or in  accessing the Limeade website from a link on a third party website, any  information you reveal on that website is not subject to this Privacy Policy.  You should consult the privacy policies of each website you visit.</strong> </p>
		  <p>		    The following describes the information we  collect from or about you and the ways we disclose, use and protect that  information. Our Privacy Policy is intended to give you a clear idea of how we  protect and manage information about you.</p>
		  <p><strong>1. Personally identifiable  information we collect:</strong> </p>
		  <p><u>In General</u><br>
            Personally Identifiable Information (or Personal  Information) is information that can be used to identify or contact you, as  well as other personal data, including, without limitation, your assessment  results and medical history. Limeade collects, stores, processes and maintains  your Personal Information (whether it was provided to us by you while using our  services or resulted from the actual use of our services). We also collect  non-personal information from you and about your use of our website and the websites  of sponsors and referral partners. As an example, Limeade may use “cookies”  and/or “web beacons” to collect non-personal information about your use of our website  or emails we send to you. Limeade does not use these cookies and web beacons  across websites and Limeade does not store any Personal Information in any  cookies on your computer. This is described in more detail below.</p>
		  <p><u>Subscription and Registration Profile</u><br>
            In order to have access to certain services  and content available on our website (such as wellness assessment, goal  tracking tools and personal journals), you are required to complete a  registration form. We use the Personal Information that you provide through  registration to deliver relevant content and respond to questions from you  and/or inform you of significant changes to this Privacy Policy. We may also  use this information to send you emails with special promotions or newsletters  with content that we think may be of interest to you. You can always opt-out of  receiving email newsletters at the time you register or at any other time by  clicking on the Email &amp; Privacy tab on the Edit Profile page.</p>
		  <p><u>Limeade Resource Tools</u><br>
            We also collect other information, some of  which may be Personal Information, which you voluntarily provide to us when you  choose to use some of the Limeade services, such as wellness assessments and  goal tracking. This may include, but is not limited to, specific information  regarding medical conditions, lifestyle, diet, exercise habits, drug and  alcohol usage, workplace matters and other relevant Personal Information  relating to your wellness. We also collect information you provide voluntarily  through responses to surveys, questionnaires and the like. </p>
		  <p><u>Surveys</u> <br>
            On a regular basis Limeade may request  information from you via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely  voluntary and it is your choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name  and address) and demographic information (such as gender and age). Personal  information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice to you  and you have the choice to opt-out of such information sharing programs.</p>
		  <p><u>Cookies</u><br>
            Limeade collects anonymous, non-personal  information about your use of our website and traffic to websites of sponsors  and referral partners. For example, we collect non-personal information about  your use of our website through the use of “cookies”. Cookies are small  computer files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive that allow us to  know how often someone visits a website and the activities they conduct while  on that website (such as the pages you visited). Every computer is assigned a  different cookie by Limeade. The information collected by cookies helps us  dynamically generate content on web pages or in emails specifically designed  for you and also allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using  our website or opening our emails, and for what purposes. We may use  non-identifiable cookie information to target certain program notifications to  your browser or to determine the popularity of certain content, sponsors or referral  partners.</p>
		  <p>		    Your browser software can be set to reject  all cookies. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to  reject cookies in the “Help” section of the toolbar. If you reject our cookie,  certain functions and conveniences of our website may not work properly but you  do not have to accept our cookie in order to productively use our website.</p>
		  <p><u>Web Beacons</u><br>
            In limited circumstances we also may use “web  beacons” to collect anonymous, non-personal information about your use of our  website. Web beacons are tiny graphic image files imbedded in a web page or  email that provide a presence on the web page or email and send back to its  home server information from the User’s browser. The information collected by  web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our website  or opening our emails. Limeade web beacons are not used to track your activity  across websites generally.</p>
		  <p><u>Children Using Our Website</u><br>
            We are committed to protecting the privacy of  children. Our website is not designed or intended to attract children under the  age of 13. We do not collect Personal Information from any person we actually  know is under the age of 13.</p>
		  <p><u>Corporate Customers</u> <br>
            In many instances, our services are made  available to end-users (like you) through the websites of our corporate  customers (e.g., employers, health plans and consultancies). Unless we receive  your permission, we do not share any Personal Information about you that we may  collect with our corporate customers. However, we may share Aggregate  Information (as described below) with such corporate customers. Such  information is never disclosed in a level of detail sufficient to permit the  identification of any particular individual. </p>
		  <p>		    In addition, you should be aware that Limeade  cannot and does not control the collection and usage of Personal Information by  our corporate customers through mechanisms that are not within our control or  supervision. We can offer no assurance that the privacy practices of such  corporate customers will be similar to ours. To the extent that you are  accessing our website through an employee or health plan beneficiary portal or  other third party website, we strongly encourage you to review and understand  the privacy policies of such organizations prior to providing information to us  or them that you consider to be sensitive or personal in nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>2. What organizations are collecting  information:</strong> </p>
		  <p><u>Third Parties</u><br>
              Sponsors and partners (including our  corporate customers) identified on the Limeade website or in e-mails, special  promotions or newsletters we send you may also use their own cookies or web  beacons when you click on their link to their website or service. In certain  situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily directing  your browser to the website or server of our sponsor or partners or another third  party acting on behalf of the sponsor or partner before re-directing your  browser to its proper destination. This re-direction process will not be  apparent to you.<br>
            We do not control these third parties’ use of  cookies or web beacons, or how they manage the non-personal information they  gather through them. You should review the privacy policy of other sites you  visit or link to from our website to understand how these other sites use  cookies and how they use the information they collect through the use of  cookies or web beacons on their own sites.</p>
		  <p><u>Public  Forums and Programs</u><br>
            This Privacy Policy does not protect you when  you participate in a Limeade <strong>public forum (such as web chats, blogs and community  forums) </strong>or provide Personal Information used in the production  and broadcast of a program attended by third parties. As a service to our  users, Limeade features bulletin boards and similar forums where users can  share information or where users can post questions for experts or other  community members to answer. You should be aware that any information shared in  a bulletin board, online discussion, or other public forum is public  information and may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties that do  not adhere to our Privacy Policy. You should think carefully before disclosing  any Personal Information in any public forum.</p>
		  <p><strong>3. How the information we collect is  used and with whom it may be shared:</strong> </p>
		  <p><u>Disclosure of Your Information</u><br>
            Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or  as specifically agreed to by you, Limeade will not disclose any Personal  Information it gathers from you on our website. We may release Personal  Information to third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such  as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in  special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others. In the event that we  are legally compelled to disclose your Personal Information to a third party,  we will notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order.</p>
		  <p><u>Disclosure to Limeade Partners</u><br>
            In order to provide you with the services on  our website, we may need to share your information with third parties, our  agents, who perform services on our behalf, such as incentive fulfillment, web  hosting, and the like. They may also collect information on our behalf. In this  use, a limited amount of your registration information is provided to these  partners for purposes of fulfillment. This information is restricted in its use  through contractual obligations with these companies and not used for any other  purpose than to provide services to you on behalf of Limeade.</p>
		  <p><u>Disclosure to Linked Sites</u><br>
            In addition to the third party websites that  you may access as described above, for your convenience there are links to websites  operated by companies other than Limeade (“Third Party websites”) that are not  contractors who provide content or services through our website. These links  may be found referenced within content on our website, or placed beside the  names or logos of sponsors and partners. Limeade does not disclose your  Personal Information to these Third Party websites without obtaining your  consent. Limeade does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices  of these sites. If you choose to link to one of these Third party websites, you  should review the privacy policy posted on this other website to understand how  that Third Party website collects and uses your Personal Information.</p>
		  <p><u>Disclosure of Aggregate Information</u><br>
            Limeade may provide to third parties  non-personal information about you that does not allow you to be identified or  contacted and that is combined with the non-personal information of other users  (“Aggregate Information”). For example, we might inform third parties regarding  the number of users of our website and the services they utilize while on our website.  Depending on the circumstances of each instance, we may or may not charge third  parties for this Aggregate Information. We also may not limit the third  parties’ use of the Aggregate Information, except that we do require third  parties to whom we disclose Aggregate Information to agree that they will not  attempt to make this information personally identifiable by combining it with  other databases or otherwise.</p>
		  <p><strong>4. What internal privacy and security  procedures are&nbsp;in place:</strong> </p>
		  <p>While we do not engage in the  practice of medicine or provide medical diagnoses or recommendations about the  course of treatment for your particular circumstances, and do not recommend or  endorse any specific tests, products, procedures, opinions, or information that  may be contained in or linked to our website for your particular circumstances,  we may in certain circumstances be subject to the rules and regulations applicable  to “covered entities” under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability  Act (“HIPAA”) and it is our general policy to maintain your Personal  Information in accordance with the HIPAA security rule and with Truste. </p>
		  <p>All data is maintained in  secure locations with access limited to authorized personnel. We do not sell or  rent personal data to other companies. We delegate the task of physically  safeguarding our repository of user data to the SolidSpace data center at 111  North Chestnut Street, Winton-Salem, NC 27101. The data center implements  standard physical access security precautions such as locked access points. </p>
		  <p>We encrypt sensitive data  such as Personal Information data using SSL or VPN whenever it is transmitted  over the Internet. However, we cannot completely ensure the privacy of e-mail  communications to and from our website because they are not encrypted and,  therefore, not secure. Inside the data center, electronic access is secured  using standard Microsoft Windows operating system user/password authentication.  Key passwords are rotated on a semi annual basis, and also when employees leave  the company. In addition, employees are contractually bound to maintain the  privacy of the data. </p>
		  <p>In order to mitigate the  possibility of loss in the event of an earthquake, flood, or tornado, the data  center is physically located in a spot where those hazards are relatively  unlikely. In addition, database backups are made regularly and encrypted  versions of same are transmitted over the network and retained in a different  location. In the event that it is necessary to recover previously backed up  data, contact us at privacy@limeade.com. </p>
		  <p>In the event of a hardware  failure, contact SolidSpace, at (888) 340-0020 or support@solidspace.com. The  data center is staffed weekdays between 8am (Eastern Time) and 6pm (Eastern  Time), with designated on call person after hours. The computer vendor, Dell,  will provide replacement parts within 3 days. Immediate failover is implemented  for selected critical hardware such as the web servers. </p>
		  <p>Compliance with security  rules is periodically audited by our Chief Technology Officer and we  continually assess the adequacy of, and where appropriate improve, our control  and procedures.</p>
		  <p>Users are able to self  administer key privacy settings via the website in order to keep their Personal  Information private. If a user contacts notifies Limeade of incorrect Personal  Information on the website, it will be corrected within 2 business days. </p>
		  <p>		    We also work diligently protect your  information off-line. Only employees who need the information to perform a  specific job (for example, customer service) are granted access to personally  identifiable information. ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and  privacy practices. Periodically, as well as any time new policies are added,  our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on  privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Limeade  employees and our third party service providers must abide by this policy and  those who violate it are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including  termination of employment or other legal action as permitted by law.</p>
		  <p>		    Like other Internet sites, Limeade cannot  guarantee that it is completely secure from individuals who might attempt to  bypass security measures or intercept transmissions over the Internet. Although  we will make every reasonable effort to protect your Personal Information from  loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is  always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. There  is also some risk that thieves could find a way to thwart our security systems.</p>
