		Privacy Policy		</h2>
		<div class="Section1">
		
		  <p>This Privacy Policy is  effective as of March 1, 2008.</p>
		  <p>		  				Limeade, Inc. (“Limeade,”  “our,” or “we” or “us”) respects your individual privacy and this Privacy  Policy informs users (“you” or “your”) of our website about what information we  collect about you and how we may use or disclosure your information.&nbsp; This privacy policy documents our adherence  to industry standards for the protection of your personal information.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy<strong> </strong>applies to  information collected through the site limeade.com (the “Site”) and information collected through other channels,  and covers the following areas:&nbsp; <br>
		  				</p><ul><li>What  personally identifiable information is collected by Limeade or by any third  party through our site;</li><br>
		  				<li>How Limeade uses this  information;</li><br>
		  				<li>With whom Limeade may disclose this  information;</li><br>
		  				<li>What  choices are available to you as a user of the Site with respect to collection, use and distribution of the information;</li><br>
		  				<li>What  types of security procedures are in place to protect the confidentiality and integrity  of information under our control; and </li><br>
		  				<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in  the information. <p></p></li></ul>
		  <p><strong>Any information (including personal and health information) that  you reveal in a Limeade public forum (such as in web chats, blogs and community  forums) is NOT protected by this Privacy Policy.</strong><strong>&nbsp; Third  parties not related to Limeade may see such postings. What you share or  disclose in these public forums could be used by others in ways we are unable  to control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes.&nbsp; In addition, if you access a third party  website from a link or search tool on Limeade or when you access the Limeade  website from a link on a third party website, any information you reveal on that  website is not subject to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;  You should consult the privacy policies of each website you visit.</strong> </p>
		  <p>		  				By using the Site, you are  agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; </p>
		  <h4>Personal  Identifiable Information (Personal Information)</h4>
		  <p>Personally  Identifiable Information (or Personal Information) is information that we  collect about you that can be used to identify or contact you, as well as other  personal data, including, but not limited to, your assessment results and  medical history.&nbsp; <br>
		  				While some of  the Personal Information provided by you or collected by us in this Site may be  health information, Limeade is not subject to the Privacy and Security Rules  applicable to a “covered entity,” as defined at 45 C.F.R. § 160.103, under the  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”).&nbsp; Limeade may, however, be subject to some of  the HIPAA rules and regulations as a “business associate” of a covered entity  and will comply with such rules and regulations under those circumstances.&nbsp; Even though Limeade is not subject to the  HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, it is our policy to maintain the privacy and  security of your Personal Information in accordance with industry best  practices; many of which are consistent with the principles underlying HIPAA. </p>
		  <h4>Information  Collection and Use</h4>
		  <p>Limeade  collects information on the Site at five different stages: anonymous  information; subscription and registration profile; Limeade resource tools;  surveys; and public forums.</p>
		  <p><em>A. &nbsp;&nbsp; Anonymous  information.</em><br>
		  				First, we  collect anonymous, aggregate information (such as domain name or IP address)  from all visitors to the Site.&nbsp; This type  of information is never linked to any personally identifiable information and  is only used for internal purposes to help us improve your user experience,  including to generate statistical reports about the use of our Site.&nbsp; </p>
		  <p>		  				As an example,  Limeade may use “cookies” and/or “web beacons” to collect non-personal  information about your use of our website or emails we send you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies are small computer files that we transfer  to your computer’s hard drive that allow us to know how often someone visits a  website and the activities they conduct while on that website.&nbsp; Your internet browser software can be set to  reject all cookies.&nbsp; Most browsers offer  instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies.&nbsp; If you reject our cookie, certain functions  and conveniences of our website may not work properly but you do not have to  accept our cookie in order to productively use our website.&nbsp; Web beacons are tiny graphic image files  imbedded in a web page or email that provide a presence on the web page or  email and send back to its home server information from the user’s  browser.&nbsp; The information collected by  cookies and web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are  using our website or opening our emails.</p>
		  <p>		  				B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Subscription  and Registration Profile</em><br>
		  				Second, we  require the submission of a working e-mail address for you to register to use  the Site or receive notices about the Site.&nbsp;  Registration for Limeade does not require you to submit any other  personal identifiers such as name, address, telephone number, or social  security number.&nbsp; We use the Personal  information that you provide through registration to deliver relevant content  and respond to questions from you and/or inform you of material changes to this  Privacy Policy.&nbsp; We may also use this  information to send you email with special promotions or newsletters with  content that we think may be of interest to you.&nbsp; You can always opt-out of receiving email newsletters  at the time you register or at any other time by clicking on the Email and  Privacy tab on the Edit Profile page.</p>
		  <p>		  				You may also  elect to voluntarily submit additional Personal Information, for example your  name, address, birthdate, or photo, in order to enhance your profile on the Site.&nbsp; Submission of these personal identifiers is  strictly voluntary.</p>
		  <p>		  				C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Limeade Resource Tools.</em><br>
		  				Limeade will  collect other information, some of which may be Personal Information, which you  voluntarily provide to us when you choose to register for and use some of the  Limeade services, such as wellness assessments and goal tracking. This may  include, but is not limited to, specific information regarding medical  conditions, lifestyle, diet, exercise habits, drug and alcohol usage, workplace  matters and other relevant Personal Information relating to your wellness. We  may also collect information you provide voluntarily through responses to  surveys and questionnaires. </p>
		  <p>		  				D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Surveys</em><br>
		  				On a regular  basis Limeade may request information from you via surveys.&nbsp; Participation in these surveys is completely  voluntary and it is your choice whether or not to disclose your  information.&nbsp; The requested information  typically includes contact information (such as name and address) and demographic  information (such as gender and age). Personal information is not shared with  third parties unless we give you prior notice and you are given the opportunity  to opt-out of such information sharing programs.</p>
		  <p>		  				E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Public  Forums</em><br>
		  				As a service to our users, Limeade features bulletin  boards and similar public forums, such as web chats and blogs, where users can  share information or where users can post questions for other community members  to answer. You should be aware that any information shared in a bulletin board,  online discussion, or other public forum is public information and may be seen,  disclosed to or collected by third parties that do not adhere to nor are  subject to our Privacy Policy. You should think carefully before disclosing any  Personal Information in any public forum.</p>
		  <h4>Personal  Information of Children Under 13</h4>
		  <p>Limeade  complies with the requirements of the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act  (COPPA) and the FTC’s Rule interpreting COPPA (16 CFR § 512).&nbsp; This Site is not directed to children and we  do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children  under 13 years of age through this Site. </p>
		  <h4>Disclosure of  Your Personal Information</h4>
		  <p>Unless we  receive your permission, Limeade will not sell, rent, or share Personal Information  to or with any third party not affiliated with or owned by Limeade, with the  following exceptions:</p>
		  <ul>
		  				<li><strong>Third  Party Wellness Providers: </strong>Limeade may disclose your Personal Information to  third parties who provide disease management, health management, behavioral  coaching, or similar wellness-related services (“Third Party Wellness  Providers”), subject to any contractual restrictions or conditions between  Limeade and such Third Party Wellness Providers.&nbsp; These Third Party Wellness Providers are  separate and distinct entities completely independent from Limeade.&nbsp; These Third Party Wellness Providers may  contact you to market their services to you.&nbsp;  If you agree to accept the services offered by the Third Party Wellness  Provider, such agreement is solely between you and the Third Party Wellness  Providers.&nbsp; Limeade is not responsible  for the privacy practices of the Third Party Wellness Providers.</li>
		  				<li><strong>Provision  of Service:</strong>&nbsp;Limeade may disclose your Personal Information  with third parties to provide you with a product or service that you have  requested from us.</li>
		  				<li><strong>Agents  and Contractors:</strong>&nbsp; In order to provide  you with the services on the Site, we may disclose your information to our  agents, contractors, or service providers who perform services on our behalf,  such as incentive fulfillment, web hosting, or data storage.&nbsp; These third parties may also collect  information on our behalf.&nbsp; Limeade will ensure  that any agent, contractor, or service provider to whom we share information agrees  to the same restrictions and conditions that apply through this Privacy Policy  to Limeade with respect to such information. </li>
		  				<li><strong>Covered Entities: </strong>Limeade may disclose your personal information to  a “covered entity,” as defined at 45 C.F.R. § 160.103, under HIPAA, if  necessary to comply with a business associate agreement, as defined at 45  C.F.R. § 160.103, entered into by Limeade with a covered entity.<strong> </strong></li>
		  				<li><strong>Use and  Disclosure of Aggregate Information:</strong> We  may store information that we collect through log files to create a profile of  our users.&nbsp; Log files record  internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service provider  (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of  clicks to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a customer’s movement in  the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.&nbsp; IP addresses, etc. are not linked to  personally identifiable information.&nbsp; A profile is stored information detailing how  individual customers use the Site.&nbsp; </li>
		  				</ul>
		  <p>Limeade may provide to third parties, including to our  corporate sponsors, non-personal information about you in a profile that does  not allow you to be identified or contacted and that is combined with the  non-personal information of other users (“Aggregate Information”). For example,  we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of our website and  the services they utilize while on our website. Depending on the circumstances  of each instance, we may or may not charge third parties for this Aggregate  Information. We also may not limit the third parties’ use of the Aggregate  Information, except that we do require third parties to whom we disclose  Aggregate Information to agree that they will not attempt to make this  information personally identifiable by combining it with other databases or  otherwise.</p>
		  <h4>Disclosure  of Personal Information As Required By Law: We will disclose Personal Information  when required by law, or if we have a good-faith belief that such action is  necessary to (a) comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or  legal process served on us, (b) protect and defend our rights, (c) protect the  rights, property, and other interests of our users or others, or (d) if  necessary to avert a serious threat to a user’s or another’s health or safety.</h4>
		  <h4>Business  Structure Transitions: In the event Limeade goes through a business transition,  such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its  assets, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred.&nbsp; The information transferred or shared remains  subject to the promises made in any previously applicable privacy policy,  unless you agree to new terms. </h4>
		  <h4>Sharing  Information with Corporation Customers</h4>
		  <p>In many instances, our services  are made available to end-users (like you) through the websites of our  corporate customers (e.g., employers, health plans and consultants). Unless we  receive your permission, we do not share with our corporate customers any of  your Personal Information that we may collect. However, we may share Aggregate  Information (as described above) with such corporate customers. Such  information is never disclosed in a level of detail sufficient to permit the  identification of any particular individual. </p>
		  <p>Limeade cannot and does not  control the collection and usage of Personal Information by our corporate  customers through mechanisms that are not within our control or supervision. We  can offer no assurance that the privacy practices of such corporate customers  will be similar to ours. To the extent that you are accessing the Site through  an employee or health plan beneficiary portal or other third party website, we  strongly encourage you to review and understand the privacy policies of such  organizations prior to providing information to us or them that you consider to  be sensitive or personal in nature. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		  <h4>Additional Uses of  Your Personal Information</h4>
		  <ul>
		  				<li><strong>Administrative  Notices:</strong> Limeade reserves the right to send you specific administrative  notices about your registration or subscription or to contact you if required  by law. You may not opt-out of these kinds of communications.</li>
		  				</ul>
		  <ul type="disc">
							<li><strong>Emails and Newsletters:</strong> During program registration and at various times as you use the Site, you       may have the option of receiving emails or newsletters directly from       Limeade or third parties who are participating in research, marketing       surveys, and similar activities. You may elect to opt-in or opt-out of       these communications by placing a check mark beside a statement that       expresses a preference for receiving these communications or participating       in these activities. In order to provide you with enhanced functionality       and services, we may seek your permission to share your Personal       Information with contractors and/or Third Party websites. You are not       obligated to opt-in to such programs.&nbsp; </li>
		  				</ul>
		  <p>Additional  information about our other services and products will be sent to you only if  you have expressly chosen to receive such information. If you do not wish to  receive website newsletters or additional information you may remove yourself  from communication lists easily by following instructions within the  newsletters. </p>
		  <ul>
		  				<li><strong>Third  Party Products and Services:</strong> We may also enter into arrangements with our  partners and other vendors where we agree to promote third-party products and  services directly (e.g. through targeted mailings, telephone calls or other  communications) to our users without sharing your Personal Information. You  have the option of remove yourself from these lists easily by following the  instructions that will accompany any such communications. </li>
		  				</ul>
		  <h4>Links</h4>
		  <p>This Site  contains links to other sites, including links to sponsors and partners  (including our corporate customers).&nbsp;  Limeade is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these  other sites.&nbsp; We encourage you to be  aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and  every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies solely to  information collected by our Site. </p>
		  <h4>Security</h4>
		  <p>Limeade maintains administrative, physical, and  technical safeguards to reasonably and appropriately protect the  confidentiality, availability, and integrity of your Personal Information.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, we maintain data in secure  locations with access limited to authorized personnel and all of our employees  are kept up-to-date on our security practices.&nbsp;  We delegate the task of physically safeguarding our repository of  user data to the SolidSpace data center in Winton-Salem, N.C. While we encrypt  sensitive data, such as Personal Information, using SSL or VPN whenever it is  transmitted over the Internet, we cannot completely ensure the privacy of  e-mail communications to and from our Site because they are not encrypted and,  therefore, not secure. </p>
		  <p>		  				Given the nature of the Internet and the fact  that network security measures are not infallible, we cannot guarantee the  security of your information. &nbsp;We  maintain notification procedures as part of our information security policy, to  be used in the event we become aware of a material data security breach.&nbsp; If we are required to provide notice to you  of a data security breach, the notice will be provided in electronic form at  the email address you have provided to Limeade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>		  				Compliance with our security policies is periodically  audited by our Chief Technology Officer and we continually assess the adequacy  of, and where appropriate improve, our security controls and procedures.&nbsp; Limeade employees and our third party service  providers must abide by this policy and those who violate it are subject to corrective  action, up to and including termination of employment or other legal action as  permitted by law.</p>
		  <p>		  				When  registering for access to a secure area of the Site, we will ask you to select  a username and password. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to  anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or  in an unsolicited email. Also, remember to sign out of the registered Site and  close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure  that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence when  accessing your computer.<br>
		  				If you have any questions about the security at  our Site, you can send a message to member support at &nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@limeade.com">support@limeade.com</a>. <strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong> </strong></p>
		  <h4>Correcting, Updating, and Deleting Personal Information </h4>
		  <p>Users are able to self administer key privacy settings  via the website in order to keep their Personal Information private.&nbsp; You can always contact us in order to delete  any of your Personal Information from our systems or if your Personal  Information on the website is incorrect.&nbsp;  We will make the requested correction or deletion within two (2)  business days. <br>
		  				You should be aware that, if our website was made  available to you by a corporate customer that is sponsoring your usage of the  website, your eligibility to receive promotional benefits from such parties, if  any such benefits are offered, may be adversely affected by your election to  remove your Personal Information from our systems. You must contact the  sponsoring organization directly for further information.&nbsp; </p>
		  <h4>Notification of Changes</h4>
		  <p>If we decide  to change our Privacy Policy, we will post the changes on this page with an  updated effective date, and we may post a notice on the Site’s main page and  other pages to alert you about the change.&nbsp; <br>
		  				If the  privacy policy changes materially so that we are going to use your personally  identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of  collection, we will notify you by either sending you an email or by posting a  notice on the Site’s main page. However, if you deleted and deactivated your  account, then you will not be contacted. </p>
