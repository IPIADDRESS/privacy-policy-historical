  <h1>LimeLife Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>LimeLife is committed to protecting the personal information collected about you. To further this commitment, we have adopted this Privacy Policy to guide how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us. </p>
  <p>LimeLife provides this general audience site for users of all ages. Section 3 of this Privacy Policy contains specific details regarding personal information collected from children.</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through the Site, and does not apply to information that may be collected by LimeLife offline.</p>
  <h2><strong>Information Collected</strong></h2>
  <p>Personal Information</p>
  <p>In general, you can visit the Site without revealing any information about yourself that could identify you personally, such as your first and last name, address, email address, or telephone number(s) (“Personal Information”). If you register to receive our newsletter, we will collect any Personal Information that you choose to submit. </p>

Traffic Data is anonymous and you will not be personally identified from this information.</p>

  <p>LimeLife does not currently, but may in the future, use cookies on the Site. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that sites often store on a user's computer. Cookies do not include people's names, email addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user's computer and to "remember" things about the user's visit.

  <p>LimeLife will not sell or rent your Personal Information to third-parties for any purpose without your consent. </p>
  <p>LimeLife may use your Personal Information to send you information you have requested about LimeLife or our products, or to send you our newsletter if you request it. </p>
  <p>LimeLife may engage a trusted third party to perform functions on our behalf (such as fulfilling newsletter subscriptions, sending requested postal mail and e-mail communications, analyzing data, and providing customer service). These third parties may have access to Traffic Data and Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but we do not permit them to use it for other purposes. </p>
  <p>LimeLife may share your Personal Information you provide with LimeLife subsidiaries and related companies. In addition, LimeLife may disclose Personally information (i) when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (ii) to verify or enforce compliance with the Terms of Use and applicable laws; (iii) to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site, or (iv) to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other corporate change.</p>
