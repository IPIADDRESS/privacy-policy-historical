                In general, you can visit the Site without revealing any information
                about yourself that could identify you personally, such as your first
                and last name, postal address, email address, and telephone number(s)
                (<b>“Personal Information”</b>). LimeLife will not sell or rent your

                        Registration — When you register with us through the Site
                        we may ask you for some Personal Information. LimeLife may use

                        or our products, or to send you our newsletter or other information
                        that may be of interest to you. During the registration process
                        you are given the opportunity to opt-in to the receipt of such
                        information from us in the future. If you decide at any time that
                        you no longer wish to receive such information from us, you may
                        follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in the communication

                When you use the Site, our system automatically gathers information
                about the nature of your usage of our service. This type of data may
                include: (i) IP address; (ii) domain server; (iii) type of computer or
                handheld device; (iv) type of web browser; and (v) telecommunications

                <h2>
                    Cookies and Action Tags
                </h2>
                Like many websites LimeLife may use cookies on the Site. A
                “cookie” is a small bit of record-keeping information that
                sites often store on a user's computer. Cookies do not include people’s
                names, email addresses, or other information that is personally
                identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user's
                computer and to “remember“ things about the user’s visit.
                You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies
                are being sent to your computer. LimeLife may also use third party advertising
                companies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. They may also use
                cookies and action tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) to collect
                anonymous information about your visits to our website and other websites
                in order to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads. They do not collect
                Personal Information.<br>
                <br>
                <h2>
                    Information Sharing and Disclosure
                </h2>
                LimeLife may engage a trusted third party to perform functions on our
                behalf (such as fulfilling newsletter subscriptions, sending requested
                postal mail and e-mail communications, analyzing data, and providing
                customer service). These third parties may have access to Traffic Data
                and Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but we do
                not permit them to use it for other purposes.<br>
                <br>
                If a promotion, sweepstakes or contest has an outside sponsor, some of
                your Personal Information may be shared with the sponsor. When necessary
                to deliver a prize, delivery information about the winner of a
                promotion, sweepstakes or contest may be shared with a third party.<br>
                <br>
                LimeLife may share your Personal Information you provide with LimeLife
                subsidiaries and related companies. In addition, LimeLife may disclose
                Personally information (i) when legally required to do so, at the
                request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (ii) to
                verify or enforce compliance with the Terms of Use and applicable laws;
                (iii) to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site, or (iv)
                to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger,
                consolidation, sale of assets or other corporate change.<br>

                    Children's Personal Information
                </h2>
