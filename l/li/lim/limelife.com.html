					LimeLife Privacy Policy
				</h1>
				<p>
				LimeLife is committed to protecting the personal information collected
				about you. To further this commitment, we have adopted this Privacy
				Policy to guide how we collect, store, and use the information you
				provide us.</p>
				<p>
				LimeLife provides this general audience site for users of all ages.
				Section 3 of this Privacy Policy contains specific details regarding
				personal information collected from children.</p>
				<p>
				This Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected
				online through the Site, and does not apply to information that may be
				collected by LimeLife offline and is incorporated into our LimeLife
				<a href="termsofuse.php">
				Terms of Use</a>.</p>
				<p>
				Your use of the LimeLife, Inc. ("<strong>LimeLife</strong>")
				web site (the “<strong>Site</strong>”), and any dispute over privacy, is
				subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations
				on damages and application of the law of the State of California.
				LimeLife reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, update or
				modify this Privacy Policy and/or our
				<a href="termsofuse.php">
					Terms of Use</a>,
				at any time by posting such change, update or modification on the Site.
				Any such change, update or modification will be effective immediately
				upon posting on the Site. Please check this policy periodically for
				changes. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes
				will mean you accept those changes. Use of information that we gather
				now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of use.</p>
				<h2>
					Information Collected and Use
				</h2>
				<p>
				Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve
				our services, features and content (“ <strong><em>Services
				</em></strong>”) to enable users to navigate and enjoy the Site.</p>
				<h2>
					Personal Information
				</h2>
				<p>
				In general, you can visit the Site without revealing any information
				about yourself that could identify you personally, such as your first
				and last name, postal address, email address, and telephone number(s)
				(“<strong><em>Personal Information</em></strong>”). LimeLife will not
				sell or rent your Personal Information to third-parties for any purpose
				without your consent. Following are the instances when we may collect
				and use your Personal Information:</p>
				<p>
				•<em>Registration </em> - When you register with us through the
				Site we may ask you for some Personal Information. LimeLife may use
				your Personal Information to send you information about LimeLife or our
				products, or to send you our newsletter or other information that may
				be of interest to you. During the registration process you are given
				the opportunity to opt-in to the receipt of such information from us
				in the future. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to
				receive such information from us, you may follow the unsubscribe
				instructions provided in the communication or you may also update or
				delete your registration profile. (See “Access/Removal of Your Personal
				Information<strong>, </strong>” below.)<br>
				•<em>Promotions </em> - If you choose to participate in one of our
				sweepstakes, contests and promotions we may also collect your Personal
				Information to administer your entry. We may also use Personal Information
				from you to contact you regarding the selection of prizewinners and to
				award prizes.<br>
				•<em>“Daily Dose” Subscription Service </em> - When you subscribe to
				Daily Dose we will collect Personal Information from you to administer
				the Service, confirm your subscription and deliver you the content you
				have requested. We may also ask for your cellular phone carrier. This
				Service is governed by the
					<a href="dailydose/terms.php">
						Daily Dose Terms of Service</a>.<br>
				•We also collect information that cannot be used to identify you
				personally that you provide as part of registration and your entry into
				all sweepstakes, contests or promotions (e.g., without limitation, gender
				and zip code) (“<strong><em>Aggregate Demographic Information</em></strong>”).
				We combine your Personal Information with the Aggregate Demographic
				Information to provide you with a better experience and improve the
				quality and value of the Services.</p>  
				<h2>
					Traffic Data
				</h2>
				<p>
				When you use the Site, our system automatically gathers information
				about the nature of your usage of our service. This type of data may
				include: (i) IP address; (ii) domain server; (iii) type of computer or
				handheld device; (iv) type of web browser; and (v) telecommunications
				carrier ("Traffic Data"). Traffic Data is anonymous and you
				will not be personally identified from this information.</p>
				<h2>
					Cookies
				</h2>
				<p>
				Like many websites LimeLife may use cookies on the Site. A
				"cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that
				sites often store on a user's computer. Cookies do not include people's
				names, email addresses, or other information that is personally
				identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user's
				computer and to "remember" things about the user's visit. You
				can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are
				being sent to your computer.</p>
				<h2>
					Information Sharing and Disclosure
				</h2>
				<p>
				LimeLife may engage a trusted third party to perform functions on our
				behalf (such as fulfilling newsletter subscriptions, sending requested
				postal mail and e-mail communications, analyzing data, and providing
				customer service). These third parties may have access to Traffic Data
				and Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but we do
				not permit them to use it for other purposes.</p>
				<p>
				If a promotion, sweepstakes or contest has an outside sponsor,&nbsp;some
				of your Personal Information&nbsp;may be shared with the sponsor. When
				necessary to deliver a prize, delivery information about the winner of a
				promotion, sweepstakes or contest may be shared with a third party.</p>
				<p>
				LimeLife may share your Personal Information you provide with LimeLife
				subsidiaries and related companies. In addition, LimeLife may disclose
				Personally information (i) when legally required to do so, at the
				request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (ii) to
				verify or enforce compliance with the Terms of Use and applicable laws;
				(iii) to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site, or (iv)
				to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger,
				consolidation, sale of assets or other corporate change.</p>
				<h2>
					Children's Personal Information
				</h2>
				<p>
				The Site complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
				("COPPA"). LimeLife does not knowingly collect Personal
				Information from children under the age of 13 through the Site. In
				addition, in the event that a user identifies himself or herself as a
				child under the age of 13 within the Site, LimeLife will not collect,
				store or use any Personal Information of such user. Further, in the
				event that LimeLife receives Personal Information that LimeLife
				discovers was provided by a child under the age of 13, LimeLife will
				promptly delete such Personal Information in a secure manner.</p>
				<h2>
					Security
				</h2>
				<p>
				LimeLife takes security very seriously. To prevent unauthorized access
				and maintain accuracy, LimeLife has security measures in place to
				protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Personal Information
				under our control.</p>

				Personal information we collect is stored in secure operating
				environments that are not available to the public and that are
				accessible only by authorized persons.</p>
				<h2>
					Links to Third Party Sites
				</h2>
				<p>
				As a convenience to you, we may provide links to third-party web sites
				from within the Site. LimeLife is not responsible for the privacy
				practices or content of these third-party sites.</p>
