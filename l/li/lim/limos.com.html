<h2>What Personal Information Does Limos.com Gather About Customers?</h2>

<p>The information we learn from Customers helps us personalize and continually improve your limousine shopping experience at Limos.com. Here are the types of information we gather:</p>
      
<h3>General Information You Give Us:</h3>

<p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you will not be able to take advantage of many of our features, including receiving a limo quote or making a reservation/booking. In order to receive quotes from Limos.com's participating third-party limousine companies (LC's), you must first create an account by providing your email or phone number and creating a password. You may also provide such information if you participate in a contest or questionnaire, or communicate with customer service; provide information in your account or profile; communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; provide employer information when opening a corporate account; provide and rate LC reviews; or employ our personal notification services, such as trip reminders. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with booking or reservation information such as your name, address, and phone numbers; credit card information; and content of reviews and e-mails to us. We use the information that you provide for our general commercial purposes including to allow us and our LC's to respond to your requests, customize future shopping for you and communicate with you.</p>

<h3>Automatic Information:</h3>

<p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Limos.com. Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform; quote/purchase history, which we sometimes aggregate with similar information from other customers to create features such as special offers and "most popular"; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) click stream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number; items you viewed or searched for; and the phone number you used to call our customer service number. We may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of our Website for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.</p>

<h2>Does Limos.com Share Personally Identifiable Information?</h2>

<p>Information about our Customers is an important part of our business. We share customer information as described below:</p>

<p>The Limos.com, Inc. corporate family:  We share information received through Limos.com and Limousinesonline.com within our corporate family—to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about their products, services and communications. Members of our corporate family may use this information to send you marketing communications if you've requested their services.</p>

<p>Limousine Company Suppliers (LC's): We share information with our third party LC's so that they may provide quote information, may communicate with Customers directly to provide service information (typically to answer Customer questions, describe the LC's services or reservation request) and provide the limousine service itself. When you request a quote, a reservation or ask a question of an LC, we share your "Customer Criteria" with the LC in order for the LC to provide you with the above information about their limousine service. Your "Customer Criteria" includes your name, your communication preference (email and/or phone call), any email or phone number you provided, your limousine ride type, vehicle preferences, dates/times and location of service and any special requests you submitted. Our LC's are prohibited by our Terms of Service agreement from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</p>

<p>Third Party Service Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf which may involve sharing information. Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, processing credit card payments, operating our Jobs page, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but pursuant to our agreements, they must not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information</p>

<p>Legal Enforcement: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Limos.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      
<p>With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p>

<p>Public Forums: Our Web sites make discussion forums available to Customers where Customers can comment on and opine with respect to matters regarding the general categories in the limousine services industry. You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information in these areas, or in any other manner that is intended for display on the forums, that information will be public information, and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond our control.</p>
      
<h2>What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?</h2>

<p>Our site includes third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites.</p>

<p>These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by these Privacy Policies. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. Limos.com also displays targeted advertising based on personal information about users.</p>
      
<h2>What Choices Do I Have?</h2>

<p>Personal Information: As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to obtain such features a receiving a quote, making a reservation, creating/reviewing your profile, past searches and creating customer reviews.</p>

<p>Review and Update Personally Identifiable Information: You can access your information at various points on the Limos.com Web site. These include:</p>

Please note that after you close an account, you will not be able to sign in or access any of your personal information. However, you can open a new account at any time. Please also note that we may retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes as well as for record-keeping integrity.</p>

<p>Communication Preferences from the Site and LC's: If you do not want to receive e-mail or phone calls from us or an LC, please adjust your customer communication preferences. You may opt-in or opt-out of newsletters, travel or customer service alerts, but we will still be permitted to send you updates to our policies and legal notices.</p>

<p>Cookies and Java Script: The help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Website of its manufacturer. However, because cookies and Java Script allow you to take advantage of some of Limos.com's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>
