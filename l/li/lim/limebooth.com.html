<h2 class="h2_underline">Privacy policy</h2>

<div class="editortext" style="text-align:justify"><p>Limebooth respects the privacy of visitors to its site.&nbsp; To inform you as clearly as possible about the way in which we collect and use your personal data, we have drawn up a privacy policy that contains all the necessary information.&nbsp; Please read this policy carefully before you provide information about yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><br></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Personal pages and personal messages</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><br></strong></p>
<p>As a user, you have personal pages with an “information” component and a “portfolio” in which you can share your own music preferences and talents, but can also add a “music <em>band</em>” or texts, and manage a list of friends.&nbsp; Only a user with an “<em>Artist”</em> profile will be able to upload video images too by means of the “<em>flash video player</em>” that we provide.&nbsp; As we strive for quality video contents, the video that you upload must meet a minimum resolution requirement.&nbsp; All these pages can be viewed also by other visitors to the site.</p>

<p>As a Limebooth user you can send messages to other members via the site.&nbsp; For instance, you can send a request to an artist.&nbsp; You are liable for the messages that you exchange with other members.&nbsp; Limebooth does not intervene in this private communication and consequently cannot be held liable. If a certain member should nonetheless violate the rules of these general terms and conditions by “<em>spamming” </em>for instance, a complaint can be lodged using the feedback form of the reporting button (abuse@limebooth.com). If this complaint turns out to be justified, Limebooth can issue an initial serious warning to the user in question and proceed to close his or her account where necessary.</p>
