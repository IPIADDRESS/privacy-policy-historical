may also use such information for marketing and promotional purposes. We may
share your personally identifiable information with other companies with which

use our e-mail services, we sometimes rely on outside companies to provide
these services to you. In such cases, we need to provide your personally
identifiable information to them. Or if you choose to purchase items through
our commerce site, we will forward your information to third parties for credit
card processing and order fulfillment. We also sometimes provide your
information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet
your needs. While <span class="bodytext1"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">LimaOhio.com</span></b></span>

information. </p>

<p class="bodytext">We also collect anonymous, aggregated data and provide it to
our advertisers and other companies that we do business with for market
research and statistical purposes. For example, we might report to our
advertisers that a certain percentage of users are between the ages of 30-35. </p>

<p class="bodytext">Finally, you should be aware that when you voluntarily
disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., first and last name,
address, e-mail address, etc.) on the forums or in the chat areas, that
information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited
messages from other posters or parties. </p>
