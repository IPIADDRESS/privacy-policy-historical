<p>
Thank you for visiting www.Lizads.com. Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this privacy policy (Privacy Policy) explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this Site.
</p>
<p>
<b>1. Introduction</b>
<br>We are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ('Personal Information') you share with us. 
<br>
Personal Information” means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, personal profile, a home or other physical address, an email address or other contact information.
<br>
Currently, we do not require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to information available on our Site. However, in order to provide you with certain services, you may use the contact form and signup pages on the Site to provide us with your email address and other specified information.
</p>
<p>
<b>2. Cookies and Lizads Ad Targeting Services</b><br>
As part of our services, Lizads has developed a platform for advertisers and publishers that uses cookies and other tracking technologies to provide non-personally identifiable preference information regarding user web browsing activity on our Site and on our clients' sites (the 'Service'). A cookie is a small text file that is assigned to you the first time you are served an ad and is stored in a file on your computer. Cookies help categorize likely consumer interest segments for use in online advertising by measuring how users utilize a website and the effectiveness of an ad. For example, this information may include the number of visits to a particular website, average time spent viewing such website, pages viewed, navigation history through the website, and other statistics. This information can then be used to better cater to users' needs. 
<br>
Cookies are intended to enhance your experience of a website by helping to deliver to you ads in which you are more likely to be interested and by allowing advertisers to ensure that you are not repeatedly served the same ads. In addition, optimizing and customizing advertising to you and other website visitors allows website owners to generate more advertising revenue. This revenue pays for the free content that they may publish for you, or free services that they may deliver to you.
<br>
However, neither Lizads nor its third party ad serving party needs cookies to deliver ads to you, and most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. 
Our cookies cannot be used by Lizads, our clients, or by any other party to access any other data on a user’s hard drive, or to personally identify them.
</p>
<p><b>3. Choice </b><br>

We may also disclose Anonymous Information (with or without compensation) to third parties, including advertisers and partners, for purposes including, but not limited to, targeting advertisements.

The use of these technologies by these third party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Policy.
