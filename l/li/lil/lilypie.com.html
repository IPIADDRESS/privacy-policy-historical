<b>OVERVIEW</b><p>
In this Privacy Policy, "us", "we" or "our" means Lilypie.com (ABN 72 866 880 115). Lilypie.com allows you to receive newsletters,
send feedback and use the Lilypie tickers. We use the information that we
collect about you to create a more personalized online experience. This is just
a brief overview, so please read on for more details about our Privacy Policy.
This Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.
</p><p>
Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only
addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you online.  We
encourage you to ask questions and to be very cautious before you disclose your
personal information to others.
</p><p>
Please <a href="/contact.php">contact us</a>  if you have any questions.
</p>
This Privacy Policy will explain the following regarding use of our site:
<ol>
	<li><b>What information does Lilypie.com collect from you?</b>
	<p>
	Lilypie.com collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally
	Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
	Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you
	with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our
	site.
	</p><p>
	<b>Personally Identifiable Information</b></p><p>
	This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you
	are. Personal information is requested when you register a Lilypie account, or send us feedback. 
	For example, this information might include your name, and e-mail address.
	</p><p>
	<b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b></p><p>
	This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific
	individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where
	you visit our site in several ways. This information is compiled
	and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. For example,
	this information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL")
	that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are
	using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is
	the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide
	Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission
	Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such
	as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol
	to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In
	other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned
	to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to
	locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in
	order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.</p>
	<a style="float:right" href="#top">TOP</a></li>
	<li><b>Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</b><p>
	Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide Lilypie.com's
	visitors with requested services.
	</p><p>
	We review the actions of the Lilypie.com visitors on an aggregate basis to
	determine customers' preferences. Lilypie.com also does research on our
	visitors' demographics, interests, and pages viewed based on the information
	provided to us from our server log files and the HTTP headers. We receive
	reports from our ad server, third party ad servers, content servers, or a web
	site analysis agent that tells us how many ads were presented and clicked upon
	or what content was served or viewed.
	</p><p>
	We gather information in the following ways:
