months in
certain circumstances). To exercise any of your rights, please email us at Privacy-service@lilithgames.com.</p><h4>1.Access</h4><p>You have the right to access personal information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it with.
You can access the personal information you have made available as part of your account by logging into your

information about you, please email us at Privacy-service@lilithgames.com.</p><h4>2.Portability</h4><p>You have the right to receive a copy of certain personal information we process about you. This comprises any

right to receive this information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have
the right to request that we transfer that personal information to another party.</p><p>If you wish for us to transfer such personal information to a third party, please ensure you detail that
party in your request. Note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. Please note that we may
not be able to provide you with personal information if providing it would interfere with another’s rights
(e.g., where providing the personal information we hold about you would reveal information about another
person or our trade secrets or intellectual property).</p><h4>3.Correction</h4><p>You have the right to correct any personal information held about you that is inaccurate. You can access the
personal information you have made available as part of your account by logging into your Game account. If
you believe we hold any other personal information about you and that information is inaccurate, please
email us at Privacy-service@lilithgames.com.</p><h4>4.Erasure</h4><p>You can delete your account, or remove certain personal information, by logging into your Game account. If
there is any other personal information you believe we process that you would like us to erase, please email

whilst we consider your request.</p><p>We may need to retain personal information if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do
so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the
case. Where you have requested that we erase personal information that has been made available publicly on
the Game Services and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps to try to tell others that
are displaying the personal information or providing links to the personal information to erase it too.</p><h4>5.Restriction of Processing to Storage Only</h4><p>You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal information we hold about you other than for
storage purposes in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that if we stop processing the personal
information, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so
(e.g., for the defence of legal claims or for another’s protection). As above, where we agree to stop
processing the personal information, we will try to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the
relevant personal information so that they can stop processing it too.</p><p>You may request we stop processing and just store the personal information we hold about you where:&nbsp;</p><ul><li> you believe the personal information is not accurate for the period it takes for us to verify whether
it is accurate</li><li> you wish to erase the personal information as the processing we are doing is unlawful but you want
us to retain the personal information but just store it instead;</li><li> you wish to erase the personal information as it is no longer necessary for our purposes but you
require it to be stored for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li></ul><h4>6.Objection</h4><p>You have the right to object to our processing of personal information about you. We will consider your
request in other circumstances as detailed below by emailing us at Privacy-service@lilithgames.com.</p><h4>7.Announcements</h4><p>We may from time to time send you announcements when we consider it necessary to do so (such as when we

You should understand though that, despite our efforts, no security can be guaranteed as impenetrable.</p><h4>2. Links to Sites and Service Operated by Others</h4><p>Lilith Service may contain links to other sites, applications, and services. Because Lilith does not operate
those other sites, applications, and services, we cannot take responsibility for the privacy practices of
the entities that operate them. We recommend that you consistently check privacy policies to understand an
operator’s practices. As a reminder, this policy describes Lilith’s practices.</p><h4>3.Changes</h4><p>Lilith may update this privacy policy from time to time.

Policy.</p><h4>5.Contact &amp; Complaints</h4><p>Questions, comments and requests regarding this policy are welcomed. Please contact us via email at
