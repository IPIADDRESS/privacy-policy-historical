            <h4>YOUR USE OF THE SITE</h4>

            <p>You can visit and navigate through our Site to information about our company, our Services, and the products offered without telling us who you are and without revealing any information that can personally identify you.  As discussed above, we use Cookies and other technology on our Site in connection with a hosted Web site analytics service that helps us better understand how our visitors use the Site.  We review the anonymous information provided by these uses of Cookies (e.g., browser type, operating system, IP address, Internet domain) to better understand how our visitors navigate through the Site; learn what content is being reviewed; administer the Site; manage online advertising on the Site; and communicate with you about your LifeStreet account, your interactions with the Services or your contacts’ interactions with the Services.  No Personally Identifiable Information is collected through our use of these Cookies.</p>

            <p>You may wish to request information about our Services, the Site, or our company.  In order to facilitate the distribution of this content, we may ask you to provide Personally Identifiable Information.  Based on the nature of your request, we may also ask for additional information, such as how you anticipate you (or your company) will make use of our Services and how you heard about us.  We store the information you provide for archival purposes and for our own marketing purposes if we feel that it is consistent with the nature of the inquiry.

We also use this information to contact site visitors by e-mail for marketing purposes if they have granted us permission (on the mailing list form or other forms on our Site) to send it to them, and for administrative purposes such as providing time and location of seminars.  Users may also be contacted by phone or postal mail for marketing purposes.</p>

Further, any information that you may post, including your profile information, is available to all users of that blog, message board, or chat room, and thus is neither private nor confidential.  We cannot guarantee the security of such information that is disclosed or communicated online in these public areas, and you do so at your own risk.  We reserve the right at any time, in our sole discretion, to remove any content that you may post on any blog, message board, or chat room and/or restrict your access to any blog, message board, or chat room.

                </li>
                <li>

            <h4>DATA INTEGRITY</h4>

            <p>We process data in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by the owning person.

            <h4>CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS OR THIS POLICY</h4>

            <p>As we continue to develop our business, we may sell certain or all of our assets.
