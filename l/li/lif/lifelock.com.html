		<p>
			As a member, you will be notified of any substantive modifications to the Privacy Policy by email, and we will prominently post notice of any such modifications on our Website. You understand and agree that you will be bound by all such modifications, if any, regardless of whether you provide such email address or receive such notice.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<strong>1. INFORMATION</strong>. LifeLock obtains information from and about you in a number of different ways, including:
		</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
			<strong>A. General Information</strong>. Some information ("General Information") is gathered automatically when you access the Website. This General Information (which may include Website pages visited, type of web browser used, type of operating system, and the domain name of your Internet service provider, and similar information) does not identify you personally.

			<strong>C. Cookie Information</strong>. Cookies are small text files that are stored by a user's web browser on the hard drive of a user's computer. Cookies can "remember" what information ("Cookie Information") a user accesses on a particular web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that website by the same user, or cookies can use that information to streamline the user's transactions on related websites.
