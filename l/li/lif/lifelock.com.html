<strong>LifeLock, Inc</strong> is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site [WWW.LIFELOCK.COM]. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed forcompliance by TRUSTe.</p>

<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact LifeLock Client Services by email at <a href="mailto:client.services@lifelock.com">client.services@lifelock.com</a> or 877.LIFELOCK. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.</p>

<p>Welcome to LifeLock. Keeping your non-public personal information secure and confidential is our top priority. Please take a moment to read the LifeLock Customer Privacy Policy carefully to learn how we handle your personal information.</p>

<p>This policy may change from time to time. Please check this policy each time you use our web site in order to have the most current information on this topic.</p>

<p>In all circumstances, we take reasonable steps to:<br>
Give you, a customer of LifeLock or as a user of our web site, clear notice when we are requesting information from you, the types of information we request from you, the general purposes for which that information will be used or disclosed, the categories of users to whom we provide the information;<br>
Offer you the ability to opt out of such uses; Maintain accurate records and provide you access to your personally identifiable information; and Use safe and secure systems, physical and electronic, to safeguard your non-public personal information.</p>

<p>While registering on our site, we will ask you for the following types of information: contact information (such as name, address, phone number, and email address); sensitive information (such as social security number); and financial information (such as credit card number). This information is required in order to verify your identity, charge you the appropriate and agreed fees and fulfill our services on your behalf with the outside agencies with whom we must communicate to set your lock.</p>

<p>We will also ask you for certain third-party personal information such as your favorite color, where and when you last attended high school. We use this information to help verify your identity with us.<br>
We do not collect personally identifiable information on our website through cookies or any other technology except where you clearly enter it.</p>

<h2>Why we collect non-public personal information</h2>

<p>As a customer of LifeLock or as a user of our web site, we want you to know that we will only collect your non-public personal information for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>To enroll you as a customer or complete a transaction</li>

<li>To place the lock on your identity</li>

<li>To resolve a case of identity theft</li>
</ul>

<p>In each of these circumstances, we will only collect and use the minimum information needed to accomplish the stated purpose, and only with your full knowledge and consent. In many of these circumstances, our principal role is actually to facilitate a relationship in which you provide your information directly to a third party - for instance, to place a fraud alert with a credit reporting agency or to file a police report. In such cases, LifeLock may not need to collect your information at all.</p>

<h2>How we collect non-public personal information</h2>

<p>When you visit the LifeLock web site, you are able to do so anonymously. Generally, we don't collect non-public personal information when you browse - not even your email address. LifeLock does collect general Internet data, such as how often each of our web pages was visited and how much time was spent on each page. None of this information identifies you personally. We use it only to analyze traffic patterns on our web site in order to make our site more useful to our visitors and to evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.</p>

<p>We use log files on our webserver as well as third-party and internally developed Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology to capture and analyze this data. We do not identify you personally, nor will we ever market to you from the information we gather without your express approval. The LifeLock web site contains links to other sites. LifeLock does not share your non-public personal information with those web sites and is not responsible for their privacy practices, which may differ from ours in significant ways. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those web sites and the companies that operate them. However, web sites to which we link may use cookie technology to gather and store data about their visitors. Cookies contain a small amount of information, possibly including non-public personal information, which allows a web server to recognize you whenever you visit. Again, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy and information collection practices of any web site you visit.<br>
</p>

<p>We also receive information from you online when you send us email, applications and other forms, or when you register at our web sites. We may also collect information about your transactions with us or with our direct partners, such as what products and services you ordered. In each of these circumstances, as mentioned above, we will only collect and use the minimum information needed to accomplish the stated purpose, and only with your full knowledge and consent. We will never share this information with any third party. The LifeLock web site is not intended for the use of children, defined as individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for non-public personal information.</p>

<h2>When and to whom we disclose non-public personal information</h2>

<p>We will never disclose your non-public personal information to any third party or affiliate under normal circumstances. As mentioned above, there are circumstances in which you yourself may provide non-public personal information to third parties involved in the crisis resolution process. Such information will be provided directly by you to the parties in question. Such third parties might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a credit reporting agency representative, in the course of placing a fraud alert;</li>

<li>a police officer, in the course of filing a police report;</li>

<li>an insurance claims officer, in the course of filing an insurance claim; or</li>

<li>a representative of a financial institution or credit card company.</li>
</ul>

<p>At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We will comply with any such law or legal process.</p>

<h2>How we protect your non-public personal information</h2>

<p>LifeLock uses highly secure physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the confidentiality and security of the data you provide to us.</p>

<ul>
<li>None of your non-public personal information will ever be disclosed by us to any third party or affiliate in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.</li>

<li>Only authorized employees of LifeLock will have access to the data that you provide to us, and that access is granted only on a "need to know" basis.</li>

<li>In cases of identity theft crisis resolution, only the advocate working on the case and key administrative supervisors have access to your non-public personal information.</li>

<li>All stored personal data is electronically encrypted.</li>

<li>We will never transmit any personal data that you provide to us over the public Internet.</li>

<li>Any data that we transmit over a private network will be sent via secure, encrypted channels.</li>

<li>Your documents, while in our care, will be treated as if they were cash. Once input into our data systems, all paper documents are destroyed, usually the same business day.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at <a href="mailto:client.services@lifelock.com">client.services@lifelock.com</a> Likewise, we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data, both on and off the Internet.</p>

<h2>Opt Out</h2>

<p>We provide you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.</p>

<p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:client.services@lifelock.com">client.services@lifelock.com</a>, or you may contact us at 877 LIFELOCK or by regular mail at:</p>

<p>LifeLock Client Services<br>
60 East Rio Salado Parkway<br>
Suite 400<br>
Tempe, AZ 85281</p>

<p>You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.</p>

<h2>Bulletin Boards and Chat Rooms</h2>

<p>From time to time we place testimonials on our website from our clients. We do this only after asking permission from the client providing the testimonial. It may be removed at any time at the request of the client. Should you choose to disclose personal information on our site, we are not responsible for the way third parties may use this information. Third parties may use your personal information for a variety of purposes, including unsolicited marketing and sales attempts.</p>

<h2>Access to your non-public personal information</h2>

<p>You always have access to the information we have about you. If you would like to review non-public personal information that LifeLock may have about you, contact us via your secure web site or call 1-877 LIFELOCK. If you need to make changes to your non-public personal information, you may do so by logging into your account on this website, by calling our Client Services Group at 1-877-LIFELOCK or by mail at:</p>

<h2>Our companywide commitment to privacy</h2>

<p>To make sure your non-public personal information remains confidential, we communicate these privacy guidelines to every LifeLock employee.</p>

<p>The LifeLock Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>

<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.</p>

<p>We use a third party cookie from Google.com which provides us with usage information regarding our site. It does not collect PII of any kind.</p>

<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as the signup procedure or login, will be limited.</p>

<h2>Service Providers</h2>

<p>We use other third parties specifically Verisign to provide credit card validation on our site. When you sign up for our services, we will share your payment information as necessary for the third party to provide that service.</p>

<p>These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</p>

<h2>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h2>

<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>

<h2>Contact Us</h2>

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at: 1.877.LIFELOCK, <a href="mailto:client.services@lifelock.com">client.services@lifelock.com</a>, <a href="/"></a>or our postal address:</p>
