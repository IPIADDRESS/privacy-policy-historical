Keeping your non-public personal information secure and confidential is one of our top priorities. This LifeLock Privacy Policy describes our information practices. Please take a moment to read this LifeLock Privacy Policy carefully to learn how we handle your personal information.</p>

<p>This policy may change from time to time. By accessing our web site, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. Each time you enroll, access or use our services or our web site, the current version of the Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, you should check this Privacy Policy when you visit our web site, and from time to time while you are enrolled for our service. Online customers may check our website regularly for updates to this Privacy Policy. You may also obtain a paper copy of the current version of our Privacy Policy by calling us at 1-800-LifeLock (543-3562) or writing us at LifeLock, 60 East Rio Salado Parkway, Suite 400, Tempe, AZ 85281.</p>

<p>We take reasonable steps to (i) give you, a member of LifeLock or a user of our web site, clear notice when we are requesting or collecting information from you, and (ii) advise you of the types of information we collect about you, the general purposes for which that information will be used or disclosed, and the categories of users to whom we provide the information. Furthermore, we take reasonable steps to maintain accurate records, provide you with access to your personally identifiable information, and to safeguard the non-public personal information we collect about you through physical and electronic systems.</p>

<h2>How we collect non-public personal information</h2>

<p>While enrolling for services, we will ask you for the following types of information: contact information (such as name, address, phone number, and email address); sensitive information (such as date of birth, driver's license number, and social security number); personal information to verify your identity, and financial information (such as credit card number). This information is required in order to verify your identity, charge you the agreed fees for our services, and to fulfill our obligation to provide services to you, including communicating with third parties as necessary to provide those services, such as identification verification companies, consumer reporting agencies, payment validation companies, law enforcement agencies, or others.</p>

<p>We also receive information from you when you send us email, applications and other forms, when you enroll for our services, or when you call us. We may also collect information about your transactions with us, such as what products and services you ordered, as well as your transactions with any third parties with whom we put you in communication.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>For visitors or members using our web site, we <strong>may</strong> also collect information about you through cookies on our web site. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable information you submit while on our web site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.</p>

<p>We also use a third party cookie from Google.com, which provides us with usage information regarding our site. That cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information you submit on our site.</p>

<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our web site, but your ability to use some areas of our web site, such as the signup procedure or login, will be limited.</p>

<h2>Aggregate Data</h2>

<p>With respect to visitors and members using our web site, LifeLock also collects general Internet data, such as how often each of our web pages was visited and how much time was spent on each page. None of this information identifies you personally. We use it only to analyze traffic patterns on our web site in order to make our site more useful to our visitors and to evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. We use log files on our webserver as well as third-party and internally developed Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology to capture and analyze this data.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

<p>The LifeLock web site contains links to other sites, including a third party referral program site. Our Privacy Policy only applies to information we collect from you while you are at and while you are actively in a session on our website. LifeLock does not share your non-public personal information with those web sites and is not responsible for their privacy practices, which may differ from ours in significant ways. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those web sites and the companies that operate them. In addition, web sites to which we link may use cookie technology to gather and store data about their visitors.</p>

<p>Any information collected in our store is collected by our merchandise supplier on their servers. This information includes ordering information such as shipping and billing names and addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and credit card information. They use this information to fulfill customer orders and requests. They do not share this information with any third parties. To learn more about our merchandise supplier's privacy practices please read their privacy policy.</p>

<h2>Why we collect non-public personal information</h2>

<p>As a member of LifeLock or as a user of our web site, we want you to know that we collect your non-public personal information for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>To enroll you as a member or complete a transaction</li>

<li>To request placement of a fraud alert on your consumer report</li>

<li>To perform or complete other LifeLock services for you, or to contact you about other LifeLock services from time to time</li>
</ul>

<h2>When and to whom we disclose non-public personal information</h2>

<p>We may disclose non-public personal information about you directly to third parties on your behalf in order to process or perform our services for you. For example, we may provide information to:</p>

<ul>
<li>a consumer reporting agency representative, in the course of placing a fraud alert</li>

<li>a police officer, in the course of filing a police report</li>

<li>an insurance claims officer, in the course of filing an insurance claim</li>

<li>a representative of a financial institution or credit card company</li>

<li>a consumer reporting agency or other organizations to order informational reports about you on your behalf</li>

<li>service providers as described below</li>
</ul>

<h2>Service Providers</h2>

<p>We may also disclose non-public personal information about you to service providers to assist us in providing our services to you. For example, we may use a payment verification company to provide credit card validation for us, an identity verification service, or a third party administrator for any customer rewards program. When you enroll for our services, we will share your information with these services providers as necessary to provide our services to you. We prohibit these service providers by contract from using your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than to complete the delivery and performance of our services.</p>

<h2>Other Members on Your Account</h2>

<p>If you have enrolled for our services with another person, we may share personally identifiable information with any other person enrolled with you on your LifeLock account.</p>

<h2>Our Marketing Agents, Other Disclosures and Disclosures Required by Law</h2>

<p>We may provide information that we collect about you to entities who market our services so that they may confirm your enrollment or deliver to you additional products or services you are expecting upon enrollment, such as special discounts or rewards. In addition, we reserve the right to use or disclose personal information we collect about you (i) in order to investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (ii) in connection with the sale, purchase, merger, or reorganization of LifeLock; or (iii) when we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of LifeLock or other persons. Further, at times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We will comply with any such law or legal process.</p>

<h2>How we protect your non-public personal information</h2>

<p>LifeLock uses strict physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the confidentiality and security of the non-public personal information you provide to us.</p>

<ul>
<li>We do not disclose your non-public personal information except as described in this privacy statement.</li>

<li>We limit access to your non-public personal information to those individuals who "need to know" in order to perform a business purpose related to our Service.</li>

<li>We encrypt sensitive non-public personal information stored electronically.</li>

<li>Any data we transmit over a private network will be sent via secure, encrypted channels.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about security of your non-public personal information or the security on our web site, you can send us email at <a href="mailto:member.services@lifelock.com" rel="nofollow">member.services@lifelock.com</a> Likewise, we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data, both on and off the Internet.</p>
