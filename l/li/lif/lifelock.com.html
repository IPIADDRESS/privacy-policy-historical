            <p>
                The security of your Personal Information is important to us and we have put into place multi-layered
                technical,
                physical and procedural measures to help keep it safe. For example, we keep Personal Information
                encrypted during
                transit and at rest using strong encryption technology and employ proactive monitoring and other tools
                to protect
                against unauthorized access. We work with third parties on an ongoing basis to keep our practices
                current and
                undergo annual third party audits that examine our practices on security and privacy.

            </p>
            <p>
                Despite our mutual efforts, you understand and agree that perfect security does not exist and understand
                that there
                is a certain amount of risk inherent in providing and receiving services over the internet. The Services
                depend upon
                your commitment to keep your Personal Information safe. You agree to use your Personal Information in a

                way and to avoid recklessly disclosing your Social Security number, financial account numbers or other
                Personal
                Information to those that could improperly use or disclose it. For example, take care not to visit sites
                that may
                transmit malware, or to respond to “phishing” scams, unsolicited emails, or pop-up messages requesting
                your Personal
                Information. You may have the opportunity to participate in contests, blogs, promotions or other
                functions by way of
                the Site. Use caution when deciding to disclose your information in such a submission as these functions
                may be
                provided by a Third Party Website and subject to terms which are different than those stated in this

            <h5>Do-Not-Track</h5>
            <p>
                Currently, we do not honor browser requests not to be tracked online (known as “Do Not Track”). You may
                opt-out,
                however, of being tracked for purposes of online advertising as set forth in the section below
                (Behavioral or
                Interest-Based Advertising). You also may opt-out of the collection of information through cookies and
                other
                tracking technologies through your browser settings, as described in this Privacy Policy.

            </p>
            <h5>Behavioral or Interest-based Advertising</h5>
            <p>
                We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our Site or to manage our advertising on
                other
                websites. For example, we use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our
                Site and
                other websites you may visit. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on
                your visits
                to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to advertise more
                effectively by
                displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network
                providers,
                advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use some of the technologies described in
                this policy,
                such as cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs) to measure the effectiveness of their
                ads and to
                personalize advertising content to you. This helps us, and them, provide advertising content to you that
                is more
                relevant and tailored to your interests. As with links to other websites that may be found on our Site,
                these
                Tracking Technologies are governed by each third party's privacy policy, not this one.

            </p>
            <p>We may provide these third-party advertisers with non-personally identifiable information about your
                usage of our
                Site and our Services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to
                our Site
                and users of our Services. We do not provide these third parties with your Personal Information. If you
                don't want
                us to show you interest-based ads or share interest-based behavioral data with third parties, you can
                opt out (see
                below). Understand that even after opting out you will still see online ads. Opting out only means that
                network
                members from whose ad networks you have opted out will no longer deliver targeted content to you. You
                may continue
                to see interest-based advertisements from other parties from whom you have not opted out, or from
                companies that
                have not adopted the self-regulatory standards for Online Behavioral Advertising that we follow. You
                will also
                continue to receive generic ads that aren’t targeted based on your visits to multiple websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network
                Advertising
                Initiative ("NAI") and the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"). For more information and available
                choices for
                third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank" style="word-wrap:break-word">www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>

                (DAA). Opting
                out of these networks does not otherwise limit the collection of Personal or General Information
                described elsewhere
                in this Policy.
            </p>

                As noted, we also participate in third party ad networks and use cookies to improve the performance of
                our
                advertising on third-party websites, including to display ads about LifeLock products on these sites.
                You may
                control our use of the General Information we collect about your activities on our Site to display
                targeted LifeLock
                advertising during your visits to third party websites. To opt out of receiving these targeted LifeLock
                ads, click
                <a href="/advertising-choices/">here</a>. Opting out of participation in LifeLock’s targeted advertising
                does not
                opt you out of our use of General Information for other purposes, such as analytics supporting
                optimization of our
                Site or development of new Products and Services.
            </p>

                subsequently erase
                your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your opt-out may no longer be effective.

            <p><strong>Web Beacons / Gifs.</strong> We employ (either directly or through one of our third party
                advertising
                partners) a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better

                on our Site by educating us on what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique
                identifier,
                similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to
                cookies,
                which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are
