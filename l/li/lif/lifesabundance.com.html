      <h2><font face="Arial">HealthyPetNet Privacy Statement</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial">HealthyPetNet has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for healthypetnet.com.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">HealthyPetNet is the best place to shop for safe, wholesome and effective pet nutrition and pet care products.  We stand behind our products and guarantee your
      satisfaction with every order.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Arial">We guarantee our products.</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">HealthyPetNet promises to deliver high-quality products, in good condition, to your door. If, for any reason, your purchase is not satisfactory, we will gladly replace it or refund your money (excluding delivery charges). Simply return your merchandise with the original paperwork and packaging within 30 days of receiving your order. We promise to process your request in a timely manner.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Arial">We guarantee first-class customer service.</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">HealthyPetNet is committed to making you and your pets happy. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our products or services, please email us at
      <a href="mailto:support@healthypetnet.com">support@healthypetnet.com</a>;  we will acknowledge your inquiry or respond within one business day. Or, you can call us at 772-781-7108.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Arial">Security</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">Your credit card is safe with HealthyPetNet.<br>
      Every time you shop with HealthyPetNet at www.healthypetnet.com, you are backed by our security guarantee. When you shop with us, you are shopping on our secure server, which encrypts all of your personal information, including name, address, and credit card number. Encryption ensures that no one can access or use your personal information. Our RC4 128 bit encryption is implemented on SSL 3.0 with a certificate from Verisign, Inc.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Arial">We guarantee your privacy</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">At HealthyPetNet, we are committed to protecting your privacy.  HealthyPetNet does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to other companies.&nbsp;It may be helpful for you to know how we use the information we collect:<br>
      We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site.</font></p>
      <h4><font face="Arial">Customers</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial">Our Customer registration form requires customers to give us contact information (such as his or her name, address, email address and phone number), which we use to ship product orders and to contact the customer if necessary.  As a direct sales company, our organization is based on our Independent Field Representatives.  Therefore, customers who register with us and do not have a Field Representative may be assigned one.&nbsp;HealthyPetNet
      will share the customer's contact information (Name, mailing address,
      phone numbers, fax number and email address) with their&nbsp;Field Representative
      so he or she can contact their customer. HealthyPetNet does not pass any
      financial information along to the sponsoring Field Representative.</font></p>
      <h4><font face="Arial">Field Representatives</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial">Our Field Representative registration form requires Field Representatives to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and unique identifiers
      (e.g., one's social security number). Contact information is used to ship product orders and keep Field Representatives informed of company news and promotions.  Unique identifiers are collected to verify the user's identity and for use in our record system.
      A Field representative is assigned a HealthyPetNet ID number that is independent of
      his or her social security number and is used for verification of identity.  If you are a Field Representative with a Replicated Home Page, HealthyPetNet may assign you customers who purchase over the HealthyPetNet website and who do not have an assigned Field Representative.  In that event, HealthyPetNet will provide the customer with your name and email address.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Arial">What Information is being shared</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services.
      We may need to share information with other companies during the course of
      business. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
      </font></p>
      <h3><font face="Arial">Email Links</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;We use email links located on the "Contact Us" page to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have.<br>
      We read every message sent in and try to reply promptly to every one. This
      information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We
      may also file your comments to improve the site and program, or review
      and discard the information. Your personal information is only shared with third parties with your explicit permission.<br>
      HealthyPetNet will not divulge aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to any third-party vendors.<br>
