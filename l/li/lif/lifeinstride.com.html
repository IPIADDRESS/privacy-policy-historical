          in to certain services and to help personalize your online experience. 
          A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a 
          web server. Some cookies are used only to assist you with your session 
          on a Website – such cookies expire automatically after you terminate 
          your session. Lifeinstride &amp; Parent Companies also uses cookies to improve 
          the sign-in experience on certain Websites. For example, your user ID 
          may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you 
          terminate your session. This cookie allows your user ID to be pre-populated, 
          so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign 
          in. Finally, Lifeinstride &amp; Parent Companies may place a cookie on your 
          hard disk on behalf of a sponsor when such sponsor’s web page is shown, 
          so that the sponsor can measure the effectiveness of such web page. 
          Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. 
          Cookies can only be accessed or read by the domain that placed them. 
          You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers 
          automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser 
          setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, 
          you may not be able to sign in or use certain features of a Website

(b) Web Beacons:<br>
          A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image 
          on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification 
          to a database and associate you with previously acquired information 
          about an individual in a database. This allows Lifeinstride &amp; Parent 
          Companies to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used 
          to track Lifeinstride &amp; Parent Companies behavioral habits for marketing 
          purposes to determine products or services with which you may be interested. 
          In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Lifeinstride &amp; Parent

          do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior 
          to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This 
          information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this 
          URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL 
          is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your 
          Internet Protocol address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") address is 
          a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your Internet 
          Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable 
          modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular 
          computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting 
          information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does 
          not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of 
          the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. 
          Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting 
          from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit 
          have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites 
          and their pages.<br>

          type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, 
          color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, 
          search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us
