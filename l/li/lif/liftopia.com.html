<b>Privacy Policy</b><br>
We are committed to protecting your privacy and creating a safe and secure online environment for anyone who visits and books on our Site. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for www.liftopia.com.<br>
<br>
Liftopia does not share, rent, sell or trade Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their promotional use. Your trust and confidence are our highest priority. For questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, please contact Liftopia at (888) 205-1764.<br>
<br>
<b>What information we collect from you</b><br>
In order to purchase from this Web site, you must first register and create a user name and password. When you register with Liftopia, we ask for the basics, including your name, e-mail address, billing address, and phone number.<br>
<br>
When you make a booking, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.<br>
<br>
For all Liftopia visitors -- not just registered users -- we collect information such as IP addresses, browser type, domain names, access times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform, new/repeat information, timestamp and exit page information. One of the uses for which this data is gathered is for statistical purposes so that we may analyze trends and performances over time. Liftopia uses third-party service providers to help us gather and analyze information about our customers. These service providers are contractually restricted from using your information in any manner, other than in helping us to provide you with the products and services available on our Site.<br>
<br>
If you contact our customer care department, we will also collect the information you provide that details the nature of your question or problem to enhance the quality of our Site.<br>
<br>
Liftopia, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on Liftopia.com. Liftopia, Inc. collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our website.<br>
<br>
<b> How your information is used</b><br>
The data we gather is used to process your purchase, contact you if problems arise and, if you have selected to receive them, send you marketing messages. All data is saved in a secure environment. The information we collect helps us better serve you. For example:<br>
<br>
Liftopia uses the information that we gather to target content on our Site to more closely match your interests and, if you have selected to receive e-mail communication from us, to target e-mail marketing messages that are more appropriate to your needs.<br>
<br>
If your personally identifiable information changes, you may update it by making the change on our My Account page. You may also email customer support at support@liftopia.com or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed at the end of this privacy policy.<br>
<br>
<b> How your information is protected</b><br>
Liftopia maintains data handling and storage practices and procedures that are designed to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of customer information. The security of your personal information is important to us. When you make a Purchase on Liftopia, you are doing so in a safe and secure environment. When you enter sensitive information (such as your credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Current Internet security methods and technologies are used to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct use of information.<br>
<br>
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email to us at info@liftopia.com.<br>
<br>
<b> With whom your information may be shared</b><br>
When you make a purchase with Liftopia, the personal information you provide will be shared with the third parties necessary to ensure the completion of your Purchase. For example, we provide your name, address, and phone number with the resort for which you purchased your lift tickets. To charge your for your transaction, we share your name, billing address, and credit card number with the credit card authorization company. The personal information provided to the third parties will not be used for any purpose other than the completion of your Purchase.<br>
<br>
Liftopia will also share your information with business firms contracted to provide specific services to us, in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. For instance, if Liftopia were to hold a sweepstakes offer on our Site, we may choose to hire a Sweepstakes Administration firm to handle the legal requirements surrounding entrant and winner selection and validation. In situations such as this where your data is shared with a third-party firm, these firms would be contractually obligated to only use your personal data for the purpose for which the relationship exists and these firms would not have the right to share your data with other organizations or contact you outside the bounds of their contract with us.<br>
<br>
From time to time, we may share general statistical information about our Site and visitors -- such as number of visitors, aggregate and non-personally identifiable demographic data, number and type of goods and services booked, etc. -- with our advertisers and partners. However, we do not reveal your name, address or other personal data for anything other than the use it was originally intended without giving you the opportunity to opt-out.<br>
<br>
Liftopia may disclose information about you to others if we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so by law or legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Liftopia or others. This includes, but is not limited to, customer fraud, technical malfunctions or abuse of our network or systems. We also may provide customer information to third parties, such as credit card companies, for the purpose of resolving disputes that arise in the normal course of business. Except as otherwise stated above, Liftopia will not disclose your personal information with any third party without your consent.<br>
<br>
This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Liftopia, Inc. Please be aware that we, Liftopia, Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.<br>
<br>
<b> What choices are available?</b><br>
In the "My Account" section of the Liftopia Site, under “My Profile”, you may make changes to your account and change your e-mail address, change your password or update your contact or credit card information. Registration and login is required to access these account settings.<br>
<br>
As we explain in more detail below, Liftopia uses cookies to improve your booking experience and reduce the time it takes for you to complete a Purchase. You may choose not to receive a cookie file by enabling your Web browser to refuse cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. Please be aware, however, that by refusing to accept cookies, you may be unable to access a significant portion of the Liftopia Site.<br>
<br>
<b> Cookies</b><br>
A cookie is a unique identifier sent to your computer by a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie lets a computer server identify your computer. A cookie is what allows many sites to greet you upon every return with a message even before you actively login. At Liftopia, we use cookies to improve your shopping experience and reduce the time it takes for you to complete a Purchase. Our cookies do not include any sensitive information, but they do help us track which of our Web pages are visited and what services are most often used. Please note that in order to use our Site, your Web browser must be configured to accept cookies. You can rest assured, however, that due to the way the technology of the Internet works, Liftopia does not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information from your computer.<br>
<br>
<b> Third-party Advertising</b><br>
From time to time, Liftopia may use a third-party advertising company to serve advertising on our behalf. Through the use of technology devices -- commonly referred to as cookies and action tags -- this third-party ad-serving company can measure the effectiveness of our ads. Liftopia does not have access to the third-party company's cookies, which are similar to our own cookies. The company employs an action tag -- also known as a Web Beacon or a one-pixel .gif file -- to set or read cookies. Liftopia's third-party ad server will also receive specific information about your order, such as the order number and product category. Rest assured that this shared information is anonymous and does not contain any sensitive information. The company may use information about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by liftopia.com and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br>
<br>
<b> Surveys or Contests</b><br>
From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name, email address, or physical address) and/or demographic info (skier vs. snowboarder, skill level, etc.). We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, as well as to get feedback on our site and identify areas of improvement. We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.<br>
<br>
<b> Mergers/Acquisitions</b><br>
In the event that Liftopia or substantially all of Liftopia's assets are acquired, customer information may be transferred to Liftopia's successor company. In the event such a transfer occurs, your personal information will be subject to the same protection as it was prior to the transfer.<br>
<br>
<b> Testimonials and Customer Feedback</b><br>
We post customer photos and testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer’s name. We will not post any personally identifiable information without first obtaining the customer’s consent.<br>
<br>
<b> Children</b><br>
Children are not eligible to make Purchases on our Site and we ask that minors (anyone under the age of 18) not submit any personal information to us. Liftopia does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18 or permit them to use our Site.<br>
<br>
<b>International Users - Applicable Law</b><br>
Liftopia collects, processes, stores, discloses and disposes of personal information that you submit to us in accordance with applicable United States law. Please note that the personal information you submit to our Site will be transferred to the United States to be processed by Liftopia in order to provide this Site and its services to you or for such other purposes as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you are not a resident of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your personal information, as discussed in this privacy policy, outside your resident jurisdiction. In addition, we may store such personal information in the United States, outside your resident jurisdiction. In particular, you are advised that the United States uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation and self-regulation. Please be aware that United States law may offer different levels of protection for personal information than may be available in your country.<br>
<br>
<b> Notification of Changes</b><br>
If we intend to use any personally identifiable information in a manner different than what is stated at the time of data collection, we will notify you via e-mail and give you the opportunity to opt-out. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices, we will post a notice on our Site advising users of the change.<br>
<br>
<b> Opt Out Opportunity</b><br>
We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. If you no longer wish to receive promotional or marketing communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each communication or by emailing us at info@liftopia.com. You may also opt out by contacting us at (888) 205-1764.<br>
<br>
