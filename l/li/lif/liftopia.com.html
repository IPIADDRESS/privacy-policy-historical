                    <p>As we explain in more detail below, Liftopia uses cookies to improve your ordering experience and to reduce the time it takes for you to complete a purchase transaction. You may choose not to receive a cookie file by enabling your Web browser to refuse cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. Please be aware, however, that by refusing to accept cookies, you may be unable to access a significant portion of the Site.</p>

                    <h4>Cookies</h4>
                    <p>A cookie is a unique identifier sent to your computer by a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie lets a computer server identify your computer. A cookie is what allows many sites to greet you upon every return with a message even before you actively login. At Liftopia, we use cookies to improve your shopping experience, reduce the time it takes for you to complete a purchase transaction, and to serve advertisements as described below. Our cookies do not retrieve any Personally Identifiable Information, but they do help us track which of our Web pages are visited, the date and time of such visit, and what services are most often used. Please note that in order to use our Site, your Web browser must be configured to accept cookies.</p>
                    <p>The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use both session ID and persistent cookies to help you navigate through our site. </p>

                    <h4>Clear Gifs</h4>
                    <p>We and our third party advertising partners employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. </p>
                    <p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  </p>

                    <h4>Affiliates and Acquisitions</h4>
                    <p>We may share some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (“Affiliates”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Statement. In the event that Liftopia or substantially all of Liftopia's assets are acquired, customer information may be transferred to Liftopia's successor company. In the event such a transfer occurs, your Personally Identifiable Information will be subject to the same protection as it was prior to the transfer.</p>

                    <h4>Public Forums</h4>
                    <p>Our web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your Personally Identifiable Information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@liftopia.com">support@liftopia.com</a>.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>

                    <h4>Social Media Features and Widgets</h4>
                    <p>Our web site includes social media features, such as the Facebook button and widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. </p>

                    <h4>Advertising</h4>
                    <p>We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by <a href="http://preferences.truste.com" target="_blank">clicking here</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

                    <h4>Children</h4>
                    <p>Children are not eligible to make purchases on our Site and we ask that anyone under the age of 13 not submit any Personally Identifiable Information to us. Liftopia does not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from anyone under the age of 13.</p>

                    <h4>International Users - Applicable Law</h4>
                    <p>Liftopia collects, processes, stores, discloses and disposes of Personally Identifiable Information that you submit to us in accordance with applicable United States law, which may be less stringent than the laws of your country. Please note that the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to our Site will be transferred to the United States to be processed by Liftopia for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Statement. If you are not a resident of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect, use and store your Personally Identifiable Information, as discussed in this Privacy Statement, outside of your resident jurisdiction.

In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. In any event, changes to this Privacy Statement may affect our use of Personally Identifiable Information that you provided us prior to our notification to you of the changes. If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your Personally Identifiable Information, you must notify us prior to the effective date of the changes that you wish to deactivate your Account with us.
