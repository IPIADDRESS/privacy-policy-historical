<h2>LifeOut Systems, LLC has created this privacy policy in recognition of our members right to keep personal information private.  This statement details our information gathering and dissemination practices for LifeOut.com.  If you have comments or questions regarding this policy, please contact us via the contact form.</h2>

<div id="indent-div">

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>LifeOut.com sets cookies in order to gather broad demographic information, to deliver content requested by you or specific to your interests, to customize our website for you, and to save your member name and password in order to allow you to visit member-only zones of LifeOut.com.</p>
<p>A cookie is a small string of data that is stored on your computer.  LifeOut.com only saves your member name and password if you request it; your password is encrypted, stored on your computer and transferred over the Internet in encrypted form.  LifeOut.com web servers also occasionally create session identification cookies that allow the servers to deliver information you request.  Note that you may refuse cookies; however, doing so may prevent certain LifeOut.com zones from working.  Though cookies created by LifeOut.com may be used to collect personally identifiable information which can be matched to a specific user, this information is used only for internal purposes.</p>

<h2>Registration Form</h2>
<p>Membership to the LifeOut.com website is completely option.  LifeOut.com registration requires that users provide contact information, such as name and email address, and also demographic information, such as a birth date.  We use this information to send members information and announcements about LifeOut.com and our partners.</p>
<p>During registration, you may be offered the opportunity to receive information from third-parties.  By choosing such opportunity, you consent to allowing LifeOut.com to disclose your contact and demographic information to that third party.</p>
<p>Aggregate demographic information collected through the registration process is shared with advertisers and other partners.  This information is not traceable to an individual user.</p>

<h2>Message Forums, Polls, Community Tools</h2>
<p>LifeOut.com provides many options for member interaction and community, including message forums, online polls, and other tools.  In some cases, use of such tools may reveal a user's member name or email address and may permit users to publish certain personal information (such as webpage links) on the LifeOut.com website.  In all cases, users affirmatively choose to expose or place this information in public areas of the LifeOut.com website, and thereby agree that such information may be viewed by or forwarded to anyone.  Users who do not want this information to be publicly available should not use these optional features of the LifeOut.com website.  Aggregate results of polls may be shared on the LifeOut.com website.</p>

<h2>LifeOut.com Personals</h2>
<p>LifeOut.com permits users to submit personal information for use in our Personals.  This information is stored for the purposes of member self-publishing and interaction and we may also use this information to customize your LifeOut.com experience.  By registering for LifeOut.com Personals and submitting your user information, you understand that anyone may have access to and forward this information.  As with all parts of LifeOut.com, we will not use LifeOut.com Personals to knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>
<p>LifeOut.com permits users to submit additional adult-oriented personal information for use in our Personals.  This information is also stored for the purposes of member self-publishing and interaction.  By registering for LifeOut.com Personals and submitting your additional user information, you understand that anyone may have access to and forward this information.  LifeOut.com will not knowingly collect adult-oriented personal information from those under the age of 18.</p>

<h2>LifeOut.com Websites</h2>
<p>LifeOut.com permits users to create their own personal websites at LifeOut.com.  The information provided by the user, either via upload, or use of a webpage generation tool, is stored for the purpose of member self-publishing and interaction.  By using the LifeOut.com website feature, you understand that anyone may have access to and forward this information.</p>

<h2>Member Feedback</h2>
<p>LifeOut.com stores feedback sent to us by members.   This feedback is used to administer and refine the LifeOut.com website and associated services and at time may be shared with LifeOut.com partners either in aggregate form or individually with specific characteristics about the Member (such as email address and name) removed.</p>

<h2>IP Addresses/Clear GIFs</h2>
<p>LifeOut.com tracks individual IP addresses and uses clear GIFs to help diagnose problems with our service, to administer our site and to gather broad demographic information.  User IP address information is used only for our internal purposes.  Information gathered through our use of clear GIFs cannot be traced to an individual user and is used only for our internal purposes.</p>

<h2>Additional Scenarios</h2>
<p>LifeOut.com may also disclose personal and aggregate information when required by a valid legal mechanism such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, or when we deem it necessary, in our sole discretion, to protect our rights and the safety of others, or our members, employees, or properties.</p>
<p>Please remember that what you write or post in a public area such as a message forum is available to all LifeOut.com members, and in many cases other visitors to the LifeOut.com website.  Also keep in mind that LifeOut.com is not responsible for what other users may do with private conversations you've had with them.</p>

<h2>Off-Site Links</h2>
<p>LifeOut.com provides links to sites external to the LifeOut Systems family.  LifeOut.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or contents of these other sites.</p>

<h2>Delete/Deactivate Information</h2>
<p>LifeOut.com provides users the option for removing their information from our database.  Contact LifeOut.com support through the Contact form.  Be sure to include your member name, email address, name, and password.</p>

<h2>Change/Modify Information</h2>
<p>LifeOut.com provides users the option to change or modify information previously provided.  Visit the My LifeOut section of the website to make such changes.</p>

<h2>Contacting Us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions regarding this privacy statement, the practices of this website, or your dealing with this website, please contact us via the Contact form.</p>

<h2>Change Policy</h2>
<p>Occasionally we may revise this privacy notice.  If we make a change, we will post a notice on the LifeOut.com website or notify you by email, at which time you will be able to "opt out" of these new practices by contacting us.</p>
