    <h2><a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/privacy/" title="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a></h2>
    The www.lifehacker.com.au website is owned and operated by Allure Media Pty Limited (Allure Media, we, us or our).
<p>Allure Media is bound by the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) in
the Privacy Act 1988 and this Privacy Policy applies to Allure Media
and the websites it operates.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all Allure Media's business
activities. Also, to the extent that it relates to personal information
supplied by users of our websites, it forms part of the terms and
conditions of those websites. This is explained in more detail in the
terms and conditions of each of the websites we operate. </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy outlines how Allure Media handles personal
information. "Personal information" is information or an opinion that
identifies an individual, or from which an individual's identity
reasonably can be ascertained. </p>
<p><strong>1. What personal information do we collect and why?</strong></p>
<p><strong>(a) Website users</strong></p>
<p>Much of the personal information that Allure Media collects is
information that website users volunteer to us (through our websites). </p>
<p>For instance, personal information is provided by users who register
for our website services (Registration Information), including: </p>
<p>
</p><ul><li>Discussion boards: Sometimes we provide a discussion board service
on our websites so that users can discuss common topics of interest. If
a user chooses to sign up to a discussion board service, they must
provide us with some personal information including a valid email
address. Allure Media uses this personal information to identify users
who leave comments prohibited by our terms and conditions of use, and
also to identify topics of interest to discussion board users; and </li><li>Comments: Also, website users can choose to leave comments
on particular articles of interest. To leave a comment, users must
submit personal information including a valid email address. Allure
Media uses this information to screen out users who leave comments
prohibited by our terms and conditions of use only.</li></ul>

<p>Also, Allure Media may aggregate personal information that is
Registration Information. This is for research purposes only (and the
aggregated data will not identify any individual users). </p>
<p>The discussion boards and comment pages that we provide through our
websites are public spaces. For this reason, website users who post
information to discussion boards or comment pages are taken to consent
to such information and comments being disclosed to other users of
those websites. </p>
<p><strong>(b) Competition entrants</strong></p>
<p>As explained in the terms and conditions of our websites, from time
to time, Allure Media conducts competitions and promotions. Allure
Media will collect personal information when it does so, in order to
distribute prizes and administer the relevant competition or promotion.
</p>
<p>If we collect personal information in this way, when you enter the
competition or promotion we may also ask you to consent to us using
that information for marketing purposes or for other purposes. </p>
<p><strong>(c) Business contacts </strong></p>
<p>We also collect personal information from people we do business
with, such as contact people in our external service providers and
related bodies corporate. This information is needed so that we can
manage our business, and is collected in the ordinary course of
business.</p>
<p><strong>(d) Journalism subjects</strong></p>
<p>In the course of operating the www.lifehacker.com.au website, Allure
Media operates as a media organisation (ie in that it collects and
disseminates of news and information, and related commentary and
opinions). The NPPs do not apply to acts done or practices engaged in
by media organisations in the course of journalism if they are publicly
committed to observing standards that deal with privacy in the context
of their media activities, and which have been published in writing.</p>
<p>In operating the www.lifehacker.com.au website, Allure Media is
committed to complying with the Journalism Privacy Standards in
Annexure A of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>(e) Employees</strong></p>
<p>Allure Media also collects personal information about its own
employees, but its handling of employee information is not within the
scope of this privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>2. Will personal information be given to anyone else?</strong></p>
<p>Subject to the exceptions outlined below, Allure Media's policy is
not to disclose personal information that is Registration Information
to third parties. </p>
<p>Like most businesses, Allure Media uses a number of external service
providers to help us perform functions such as delivery, mailing, IT
and website support. For our service providers to perform those
functions effectively and efficiently it is sometimes necessary for
them to handle personal information on our behalf. This may include
Registration Information and other personal information held by us.
Under the terms of our service agreements with our service providers,
we require those external service providers to respect your privacy,
and authorise them only to use personal information that we disclose to
them in order to provide the services we require. </p>
<p>We may also disclose personal information we are under a legal
requirement to do so (eg under a court order, or if required under
legislation), or if an authorised request is made (eg from a law
enforcement agency). </p>
<p>As noted above, website users who post information to discussion
boards or comment pages consent to such information and comments being
disclosed to other users of those websites. </p>
<p><strong>3. Access and Correction</strong></p>
<p>Under the Privacy Act, you have a right to seek access to
information which we hold about you (although there are some exceptions
to this). You also have the right to ask us to correct information
about you which is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date. </p>
<p>As noted, the personal information that we hold about you will
generally be information that you have provided to us. However, if you
wish to exercise your right under the Privacy Act to seek access to
personal information that we hold about you, we ask that you contact
our Privacy Officer (details at point 7 below), who will explain how we
will handle your access request. Our policy is to consider any requests
for correction in a timely way. </p>
<p><strong>4. Is personal information stored safely?</strong></p>
<p>Allure Media takes reasonable steps to ensure that the personal
information we hold is stored in a secure environment protected from
unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We remind our staff
and contractors of the importance of storing personal information in a
secure way, and to treat it like confidential information. </p>
<p><strong>5. Cookies &amp; Log Files</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> The discussion boards hosted by our
websites may use cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the
user's computer tied to information about the user. We may use both
session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie,
once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A
persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive
for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by
following Internet browser help file directions. </p>
<p>By setting a cookie on an Allure Media site, users will not have to
log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on the
site's discussion board. We store a cookie on each user's machine that
contains a username and encrypted password. You can configure your
browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a
cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use
any products or services we offer that require you to "sign in," and
you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings. However,
not all of our services require that you accept cookies. </p>
<p><strong>Log Files:</strong> Like most standard web site servers we
use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses,
information about you browser type and your internet service provider
(ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number
of clicks you make. This is used to analyse trends, administer the
site, track users' movements in the aggregate, and gather broad
demographic information for aggregate use. However, this information is
not linked to the personal information that you provide to the site. </p>
<p><strong>6. Email/SMS marketing</strong></p>
<p>We will not email or SMS you marketing material unless you have

<p><strong>ANNEXURE A: JOURNALISM PRIVACY STANDARDS </strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The National Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 do
not apply to "acts done or practices engaged in by a media organisation
in the course of journalism", so long as that media organisation is
publicly committed to observing standards that deal with privacy in the
context of its activities and those standards have been published in
writing by the organisation. </p>
<p>Allure Media acts as a media organisation to the extent that it
operates the www.kotaku.com.au website (Website). These Journalism
Privacy Standards (Standards) outline how Allure Media's employees who
are engaged in the provision of content for the Website (Journalists)
will handle personal information.</p>
<p>The objective of these Standards is to balance the right of a person
to privacy against the media's right to inform the public about
newsworthy matters and other matters of public interest. </p>
<p><strong>What is personal information?</strong></p>
<p>"Personal information" is information or an opinion that identifies
an individual, or from which an individual's identity reasonably can be
ascertained.</p>
<p><strong>Collection of personal information by Journalists</strong></p>
<p>Journalists will collect personal information in the course of
compiling reports and other information for the Website. Journalists
should only collect personal information that is needed for an actual
or anticipated report or Website posting. </p>
<p><strong>How will personal information be used or disclosed by Journalists?</strong></p>
<p>Personal information collected by Journalists should be used or
disclosed for the purpose for which it was collected (eg for the
publication of a story on the Website) or for related purposes (eg
formulating commentary about such information, for publication on the
Website). Personal information should only be disclosed on the Website
if it is relevant to the story in question. </p>
<p><strong>How will personal information be stored and checked?</strong></p>
<p>It is a responsibility of Journalists to take reasonable steps to
check that the personal information they use is accurate, complete and
up-to-date, and that it is stored in a secure way. </p>
<p><strong>Can our sources stay anonymous?</strong></p>
<p>Journalists are not required by privacy laws to reveal the identity of confidential sources.</p>
<p><strong>What is sensitive information?</strong></p>
<p>Under the NPPs, sensitive information includes details of a person's
religion, race, sexual preferences, health or union/association
membership. Sometimes, media organisations need to collect sensitive
information if it is relevant information for a story. Journalists must
take care in relation to the use of sensitive information by taking
reasonable steps to ensure that they do not portray any person in a
negative light on the basis of that information only (eg by placing
gratuitous emphasis on age, colour, gender, national origin, physical
or mental disability, race, religion or sexual preference). The focus
should be upon the conduct or omissions, rather than the racial or
other sensitive characteristics of the person who engages (or fails to
engage in) in the relevant conduct. </p>
<p><strong>Complaints</strong></p>
<p>If you have a complaint about the handling of personal information
by Journalists, please contact our Privacy Officer (see details in
section 7 of the Allure Media Privacy Policy). </p>
