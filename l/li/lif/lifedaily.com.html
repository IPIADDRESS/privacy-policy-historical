<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of your activity on and through the Services is public by default. This may include, but is not limited to, content you have posted or shared publicly on the Site or otherwise through the services, such as written posts, comments, or other submissions by you to the Site. In addition, if you share information with third parties not functioning as a service provider to us that puts your information beyond our control and becomes subject to the policy the third party has in place. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please also remember that by choosing to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the Services, you make your information publicly available. Users reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our primary intention for collecting personal and private information from you is simply to conduct our business. We can use this internally to better serve you. Accordingly, we see no reason to share your personal information to other parties and outside interests unless you have authorized us to do so. Of course, there are instances where your information is stored with third party service providers, such as email service providers, as they provide services that are industry-leading in quality and security and are far more beneficial to our end user than attempting such services in-house. However, you are never required to deal with any such third party directly, they are limited in how they use your information, and they cannot sell or transfer it to others in any way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may access other Third Party Services through the Site, for example by clicking on links to those Third Party Services from within the Site. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services’ privacy policies.

We may share this information about our website visitors as a whole, not individually, with our partners, service providers, and other third parties with whom we conduct business for various purposes, in our sole discretion. In addition, these third parties may share with us information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.</span></p>
<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Account information will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to help prevent unauthorized access to your Account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We maintain reasonable and appropriate measures designed to maintain information we collect in a secure manner. &nbsp;We have taken certain physical, electronic, and administrative steps to safeguard and secure the information we collect from Site visitors. &nbsp;Even though we follow reasonable procedures to try to protect the information in our possession, no security system is perfect and we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your information will be secure in all circumstances.</span></p>
