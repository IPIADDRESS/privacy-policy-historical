<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p> Like most website operators, Scape Networks collects  non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers  and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,  language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each  visitor request. Scape Networks’s purpose in collecting non-personally  identifying information is to better understand how Scape Networks’s  visitors use its website. From time to time, Scape Networks may release  non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by  publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p> Scape Networks also collects potentially personally-identifying  information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Scape Networks does not  use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not  disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that  it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described  below.</p>

<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p> Certain visitors to Scape Networks’s websites choose to interact with  Scape Networks in ways that require Scape Networks to gather  personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information  that Scape Networks gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For  example, we ask visitors who sign up for a website at <a title="http://www.lifeyo.com/" href="http://www.lifeyo.com/">http://www.lifeyo.com/</a> to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in  transactions with Scape Networks – by purchasing a Domain name through our partner Register.com, are asked to provide  additional information, including as necessary the personal and  financial information required to process those transactions. In each  case, Scape Networks collects such information only insofar as is necessary  or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with  Scape Networks. Scape Networks does not disclose personally-identifying  information other than as described below. And visitors can always  refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat  that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related  activities.</p>

<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
<p> Scape Networks may collect statistics about the behavior of  visitors to  its websites. For instance, Scape Networks may monitor the most popular  websites on Lifeyo.com. Scape Networks may display this information  publicly or provide it to others. However, Scape Networks does not  disclose  personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p> Scape Networks discloses potentially personally-identifying and  personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,  contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that  information in order to process it on Scape Networks’s behalf or to provide  services available at Scape Networks’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed  not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and  affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country;  by using Scape Networks’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such  information to them. Scape Networks will not rent or sell potentially  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to  anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated  organizations, as described above, Scape Networks discloses potentially  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when  required to do so by law, or when Scape Networks believes in good faith  that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or  rights of Scape Networks, third parties or the public at large. If you are  a registered user of an Scape Networks website and have supplied your email  address, Scape Networks may occasionally send you an email to tell you  about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date  with what’s going on with Scape Networks and our products. We primarily use  our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so  we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a  request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback  mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us  clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.  Scape Networks takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against  the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a  visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the  website each time the visitor returns. Scape Networks uses cookies to help  Scape Networks identify and track visitors, their usage of Scape Networks  website, and their website access preferences. Scape Networks visitors who  do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their  browsers to refuse cookies before using Scape Networks’s websites, with the  drawback that certain features of Scape Networks’s websites may not  function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h2>Ads</h2>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by  advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad  server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online  advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your  computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things,  deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most  interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by  Scape Networks and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p> Although most changes are likely to be minor, Scape Networks may change  its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Scape Networks’s sole  discretion. Scape Networks encourages visitors to frequently check this  page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Your continued use of this site after any change in this  Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change. </p>
