<p>About LifeYo.com<br>
  LifeYo.com is an online service that allows our members to set up unique personal 
  profiles and pages that can be linked together through networks of friends. LifeYo members 
  can view each others' profiles, communicate with old friends and meet new friends 
  on the service, share photos, post text, and describe their 
  interests. To enrich our members' experience, we request and display some personal 
  information to other members and visitors, which allows our users to identify 
  each other and expand their network of friends. LifeYo members can change their 
  profile information at any time and can control how other members and the service 
  communicates with them.</p>
<p>LifeYo.com cares deeply about online privacy If you have any questions concerning 
  this privacy policy, please email us at jeremy@scapenetworks.com.</p>

   to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating 
  to the LifeYo.com service. LifeYo.com may also collect other profile data including 
  but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, education and occupation 
  in order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other.</p>

  may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements 
  to members. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes. 
  <br>

  to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the LifeYo.com social 
  networking community. Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting 
  new friends to join LifeYo, to add users to members' Friend Lists' networks, and 
  to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting 
  friends, adding friends, and notifications, a user's email address is not shared 
  or displayed to people within a user's personal network.  Users within a personal 
  network communicate on LifeYo.com with each other through the LifeYo.com service,

  privacy statement will apply. <br>
  Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members<br>
  LifeYo members can invite friends to join the service by sending invitation 
  emails via our automated invitation system. LifeYo.com stores the email addresses 
  that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the Friends Lists
  of the member sending the invitations. 
  LifeYo.com does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other 
  communication besides invitations and invitation reminders (up to three (3) per 
  email address). Recipients of invitations from LifeYo.com may contact LifeYo.com 
  to request the removal of their information from our database. </p>

  sent to any email address you control by sending a single email with the subject 
  &quot;BLOCK&quot; to jeremy@scapenetworks.com Please note that the email must come 
  from the account you wish to block. </p>-->
