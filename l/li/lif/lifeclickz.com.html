      	<h2>SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</h2>
      	<p>
      		This Privacy Statement describes the types of personal information Bevii Inc. (“Company,” “us,” “we” or “our”) collects through <a href="http://www.bevii.com">www.bevii.com</a>, (the “Site”) and our application (the “Application”, and collectively with the Site, the “Services”), and how we collect, use, and share that information.  This Privacy Statement does not govern our collection of personal information through any website or other means, other than through the Services.
      		<br><br>
    		  By using the Services, you explicitly accept, without limitation or qualification, our practices surrounding the collection, use, and sharing of personal information provided by you in the manner described in this Privacy Statement.  If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Statement, please do not access, browse, or use the Services.

      <li>
      	<h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
      	<ul>
      		<li>
      			<h3>A. Information You Give Us</h3>
      			<p>
    	  			You do not have to give us any personal information to browse the Services.  However, you may be asked to provide personal information to submit or request information from us, or to use the Services.  Once you provide us with personal information about you, you are no longer anonymous to us.  This information may include:
      			</p>
      			<dl>
      				<dt>Registration information</dt>
      				<dd>
      					When you sign up for the Services, you are required to provide information such as your name, password, email address, and profile picture.
      				</dd>
      				<dt>Profile Information</dt>
      				<dd>
      					You may choose to provide us with profile information, such as your picture, personal bio, interests, news feed, posts and other comments, phone number, physical address, email address, and links to other websites.  By default, this information will be made public to users of the Services.  Please see Section VI.B for information about how to manage the information you share through the Services.
      				</dd>
      				<dt>Additional Information</dt>
      				<dd>
      					Additional information that you provide to us, including through comments and feedback, and emails.
      				</dd>
      			</dl>
      			<p>
      				We may offer promotional items or prizes from time to time (please see our Terms of Use, available at <a href="/terms">bevii.com/terms/</a>, for more information).  In order to participate in a promotion or to claim a prize, you may be required to provide us with certain information, including without limitation you full name, age, address, email address, phone number, state or federal tax information, or any other information that we may require you to submit to claim your prize. 
      			</p>
      		</li>
      		<li>
      			<h3>B. Location Information</h3>
      			<p>
      				Our Services provide a location based social network (the “Social Network”) that uses location information to identify your offline interactions with other users of our Services.
      				<br><br>
      				We use location information obtained from location-enabled devices (including through GPS, cellular, and Wi-Fi networks) to determine your location.  We collect location information from your mobile device even when you are not actively using the Application (such as when the Application is running in the background or if you exit the Application without using “force quit”).  You can disable location services through your mobile device’s settings or the Application’s settings by turning off the location information. <strong><em>Once you manually disable location information, reopening the Application will automatically reset the settings to allow the transmission of location information (even if you do not manually adjust the settings)</em></strong>
      				<br><br>
      				If location information is enabled on your device and you are near a person who is using our Services, we will automatically add the user as a connection or relationship on your Social Network (a “Relationship”).  If you disable device-based location services, you will be able to access your profile, but you will not have full functionality of the Services.  For example, new Relationships based on your interactions will not be added to your profiles.  Please see Section VI (“Your Choices”) for information about how to control how you share information with other users of the Services.
      			</p>
      		</li>
      		<li>
      			<h3>C. Automated Information Collection</h3>
      			<p>
      				We may collect certain information about your use of the Services through the use of tracking technologies or by other passive means.  We may use Google Analytics to help us collect and analyze this information.  This “passively collected” information includes, but is not limited to, the domain name of the website that allowed you to navigate to the Services, search engines used, the internet protocol (IP) address used, the length of time spent on the Services, the pages you looked at on the Services, other websites you visited before and after visiting the Services, the type of internet browser you have, the frequency of your visits to the Services, and other relevant statistics, including the following:

      				<dt>Location Information</dt>

      				</dd>
      				<dt>Cookies</dt>

      				</dd>
      				<dt>Web Beacons</dt>
      				<dd>
      					Web beacons (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”) are 1x1 single-pixel graphics that allow us to count the number of users who have visited or accessed the Services and to recognize users by accessing our cookies.  We may employ web beacons to facilitate Services administration and navigation, to track the actions of users of the Services, to compile aggregate statistics about Services usage and response rates, and to provide an enhanced online experience for visitors to the Services.

      	<h2>YOUR CHOICES</h2>
      	<ul>
      		<li>
      			<h3>A. Information You Provide</h3>
      			<p>
      				You can always choose whether or not to provide information on the Services.  However, if you choose not to disclose certain information, you may not be able to register as a user of the Services, which may limit your access to certain portions of the Services.  For example, if you disable location services on your mobile device, we will not be able to detect interactions with other users of the Services, so we will not update your Relationships.
      			</p>
      		</li>
      		<li>
      			<h3>B. Managing Your Privacy</h3>
      			<p>
      				Your profile information will be visible to other users of the Services based on your “Relationship Level” with a user.  Your Relationship Level with a particular user is displayed in the “Relationship” tab on the Services, and displayed under the applicable user’s profile picture whenever posts by that user are visible to you.  
      				<br><br>
    				By default, the following types of information that you choose to submit will be available to all of your connections on the Services: your name, profile picture, Relationships, where you work, and where you go to school.  
    				<br><br>
    				Our Social Network includes five Relationship Levels.  A connection with a Level 1 Relationship can see all of your profile information. A connection with a Level 5 Relationship can see the least amount of information about you.
    				<br><br>
    				<strong><em>The following profile information is available to users based on your Relationship Level:</em></strong>
    			</p>
    			<dl>
    				<dt>Level 1 Relationship</dt>
    				<dd>All of your profile information is visible to the user.</dd>
    				<dt>Level 2 Relationship</dt>
    				<dd>All of your profile information except your physical address is visible to the user.</dd>
    				<dt>Level 3 Relationship</dt>
    				<dd>All of your profile information except your Contact Information is visible to the user.  Contact Information includes your physical address, telephone number, and email address. </dd>
    				<dt>Level 4 Relationship</dt>
    				<dd>All of your profile information except for your photos and Contact Information is visible to the user.</dd>
    				<dt>Level 5 Relationship</dt>
    				<dd>Your name, profile picture, and the school or workplace you list on your profile is visible to the user.</dd>
    				<dt>No Relationship</dt>
    				<dd>Your name, profile picture, and the school or workplace you list on your profile is visible to the user.  Note that users with no Relationship with you can see the same information as a user with a Level 5 Relationship.</dd>
    			</dl>
    			<p>
    				When we first detect an in-person interaction with a user, we add that user to your Relationships as a Level 5 Relationship.  We will automatically adjust the Relationship levels of your connections for a variety of factors, including without limitation based on the frequency of your interactions, length of your interactions, and place of your interactions.
    				<br><br>
    				You may change your account settings to limit what information can be viewed by other users of the Services by adjusting the Relationship level.  To change the Relationship level, go to the “Manage Relationship” link on your profile page.
