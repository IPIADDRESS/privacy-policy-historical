(“Lifetouch”) along with its wholly-owned subsidiaries Lifetouch National School Studios Inc., Lifetouch Portrait Studios Inc., Lifetouch Church Directories and Portraits Inc. (U.S. and Canada), Lifetouch Canada Inc., Lifetouch Services Inc. and their divisions doing business as JCPenney Portraits, Target Studios, Olan Mills, Prestige Portraits, Sportography, Flash Digital Portraits and Cilento Photography, (“the Lifetouch Companies”). Lifetouch is a trusted provider of photographic products and services to communities, schools, churches, day care centers and families throughout the United States and Canada. At Lifetouch, we are sensitive to the privacy concerns of visitors to our websites. Though we do not obtain any personal information that individually identifies you (e.g., your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, etc.) unless you affirmatively provide it to us, many visitors do choose to provide us with such information. This policy explains our online information practices pertaining to this website and the choices you, as a visitor to this site, can make about the collection and use of your information.</span></p>
<h4>What personal information is collected at Lifetouch.com? How is it used?</h4>
<p align="left"><span class="content">At the Lifetouch Site, we only collect personally identifiable information about you to the extent you specifically provide it to us. This includes, for example, the information you provide when you contact us through this website to place an order, contact customer service, register for a service, respond to a survey or enter a contest or sweepstakes online. We use this information you share with us</span></p>
<ul class="basic">
<li><span class="content">to provide the products or services or benefits you request,</span></li>
<li>to develop and improve our products and services,</li>
<li>to improve the content of our site and its usefulness to you, and</li>
<li><span class="content">for our own marketing and promotional purposes.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="content">Lifetouch does not sell, trade or share the information you provide us through this website with unaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes. We reserve the right to share such information among the Lifetouch Companies and you may receive product and service information from any of them. Information you submit to jcpenneyportraits.com and/or targetstudios.com (operated by Lifetouch Portrait Studios Inc.) may also be shared with the host organization, J. C. Penney Company, Inc. or Target Corporation respectively. Finally, we may also share this information with outside vendors and organizations that provide support services to us such as helping us fulfill customer orders, process credit card orders and the like. If so, these parties are authorized to use the information solely in conjunction with the specific service they provide to or on behalf of Lifetouch.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="content">We may also be required to share information you provide us through this website in other, limited circumstances in which we may share or transfer the information you provide us through this website, for example, to respond to judicial process, to comply with state, federal or local laws, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or website, to take precautions against liability, in the event of a corporate reorganization or, to the extent required by law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies.</span></p>
<h4>Safeguarding information</h4>
<p align="left"><span class="content">Within the Lifetouch Companies, we protect against unauthorized disclosures by limiting access to employees and contractors of the Lifetouch Companies who need the information to do their jobs. We also give them guidelines for adhering to our confidentiality policies.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="content">In the limited circumstances that we provide information to outside companies, we restrict it to only the information we believe is appropriate to enable them to carry out their responsibilities under our contracts.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="content">We require that the information provided be used only for the specifically authorized purpose and that its confidentiality be maintained.</span></p>
<h4>Other information about you</h4>
<p align="left"><span class="content">In addition to personal information you provide us through this website, the Lifetouch Site uses technology that lets us know what type of browser you are using, the website from which you enter the Lifetouch Site, and the pages you view as you tour our site. This technology does not identify you personally — it simply helps us compile statistics about our visitors and their use of our site. We use these statistics and share them with third parties to improve our website design and content and in connection with marketing programs.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span class="content">Our goal is to inform you about our products and services, including special promotions and coupons. We may contact you by mail or e-mail or telephone to inform you of offers. However, if you are contacted and do not wish to receive further information or contacts, use the means by which you were contacted to indicate you do not want further promotional information or contacts from them. If contacted by mail, return the mail to sender. If contacted by e-mail, reply to the e-mail sender. If telephoned, notify the person telephoning you that you do not want additional contacts from them.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="content">We will act promptly to honor your request and remove your name from the sender’s marketing list. However, even if we remove your name from use in marketing programs, you may still receive communications from the sender if necessary, for example, in connection with a pending order or customer service issue, or from other sources who obtained your contact information before we received your request or from a party other than Lifetouch.</span></p>
