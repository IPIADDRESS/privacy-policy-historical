	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>August 27, 2012</p>
<h2>LiveBinders Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>The following Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy” or “privacy policy”) governs our storage
and use of the information you provide to us during your use of the LiveBinders.com
website, and all content, services and/or products available thereon (collectively, the
"Services.").</p>

<p>This privacy policy describes LiveBinders’ information gathering and dissemination
practices with respect to information we collect through our Services. Because the
Internet is global, information about you that we collect or that you submit may be
transferred to, processed in, and held in countries (including the United States) other
than the one in which you reside. By using our Services, you explicitly consent to such
use of your information and agree to the terms of this privacy policy.</p>

<h2>Information You Choose to Submit</h2>
<p>You can use our Services without telling us who you are or revealing any personal
information (which we will refer to in this privacy policy as "Personal Data") about
yourself. To obtain access to certain areas of our Services, however, or to receive
certain services we provide (e.g., creating a livebinder, installing an application), you
may be required to register with us and, in connection with such registration, to provide
certain Personal Data (e.g., your full name, email address, billing information, and your
email address). We use such information to provide you with the services and features
you requested or registered for, and to monitor internally the usage of our Services. We
also use such information to fulfill your order and to contact you from time to time about
us, our website, and our products and services.</p>

<h2>Information We Automatically Collect</h2>
<p>We automatically collect certain information to help us understand how visitors use our
website and product (which we will refer to in this privacy policy as "Usage Data"). For
example, each time you visit our website we automatically collect your IP address,
browser and computer type, access time, the webpage from which you came, and
webpage(s) that you access during your visit. We also use cookies (which are small
amounts of data sent from a web server to your browser that are stored on your
computer's hard drive) to keep track of your use of our Services, to validate your
identity, to remember your password and preferences, to tailor our Services to meet
your personal interests, and to improve the quality of our Services. In addition, third
parties who place advertisements on our website may also collect information through
cookies to ensure that their advertising systems and technologies work properly and to
allow them to track responses to their advertisements. Cookies set by these third parties
are governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. Generally, you can set your
browser not to accept cookies or to notify you if you are sent a cookie, giving you the
opportunity to choose whether or not to accept the cookie. Please note that if you do set
your browser not to accept cookies, certain areas of our website may not function
properly and we may not be able to provide you with certain features of the Services.</p>


<h2>Our Information Sharing Practices</h2>
<p>Generally, except as otherwise described in this section of our privacy policy, we will not
￼share your Personal Data or Usage Data with any third party without your permission.</p>

<p><strong>Aggregated Data.</strong> From time to time, we may share aggregated Personal Data
(excluding any credit card information) and Usage Data with third parties. We will not
share any aggregated data, however, in a manner that would enable the recipient to
personally identify you. In addition, we may combine Usage Data with Personal Data in
a manner that enables us to trace Usage Data to an individual user.</p>

<p><strong>Service Providers.</strong> From time to time, we may enter into relationships with third parties
who provide services to us (e.g., credit card processing services, shipping services, or
data management and storage services). In those circumstances, we disclose
information about you that is necessary for such service providers to perform those
services, but only if such service providers agree not to disclose your information except
as necessary to perform such services.</p>
<p><strong>Other Disclosure Scenarios.</strong> Notwithstanding anything in this privacy policy to the
contrary, we reserve the right, unless limited by applicable law, to share any information
we have collected about you or that you have submitted: (1) in response to subpoenas,
court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or
defend against legal claims; (2) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate,
prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential
threats to the safety of any person or property; (3) if we believe it is necessary to
investigate, prevent, or take action regarding situations that involve significant abuse of
our website infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming,
denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of information); (4) to
our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common
control with us (in which case we will require such entities to honor this privacy policy);
and (5) with another entity that acquires or merges with us.</p>
<h2>Public Areas</h2>
<p>Your use of areas of our website that are intended for interaction with other users (e.g.,
message boards, discussion rooms, and other online forums) may allow you to post
Personal Data. By choosing to use these areas, you understand and agree that anyone
may access, use, and disclose any Personal Data that you post to those areas.</p>
<h2>Choice/Opt-Out</h2>
<p>We offer you the opportunity to choose not to receive communications from us. If you
would like to take advantage of this opportunity, please let us know by updating your
profile on our website. Please note that sometimes these requests may take up to ten
business days to process and that we are not responsible for removing information
about you from the database of any third party with which we shared your Personal
Data prior to processing your request. Even if you do take advantage of this opportunity,
we reserve the right to send you administrative messages relating to our Services (e.g.,
about changes to this privacy policy), to contact you regarding orders you have placed
(e.g., order confirmations), and to share your information with our service providers as
necessary to provide you with the Services</p>
<h2>Accessing, Correcting, and Deleting Your Personal Data</h2>

<p>If you would like to modify or delete from our database any Personal Data you
previously submitted to us, please let us know by accessing and updating your profile
on our site or by sending us an email to privacy (at) LiveBinders (DOT) com. (Please
send your request from the email address associated with your account and clearly
state what Personal Data you would like modified or deleted). Please note that
sometimes these requests may take up to ten business days to process, that any
Personal Data that we have copied may remain in back-up storage for some period of
time after your request, and that if you delete certain information (e.g., your billing
address or credit card number) you may not be able to purchase products in the future
without re-submitting such information. Also, please note that we will maintain
information about you in our database whenever we are required to do so by law.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We have implemented reasonable measures to help protect your Personal Data from
loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure. Unfortunately, however, no data
transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we
cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or through the
Services, and you do so at your own risk.</p>

<h2>Children Safety</h2>
<p>If students are under 13 years of age, they must have parental permission to register an
account at LiveBinders. Schools should obtain parental permission before issuing
accounts to students. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under
the age of 13 has a registered account for the Services or that we have received any
Personal Data of that child without your consent, then you may alert us at
info@livebinders.com and request that we delete that child’s Personal Data and/or
account from our systems.</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Our Services may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy
practices of any such other website (whether accessed through an advertisement,
service, or content link) and urge you to review such practices prior to submitting any
personal information to such websites.</p>
<h2>International Users</h2>
<p>If you choose to use the Services from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your personally identifiable information outside of those regions to the United States and by providing your personally identifiable information on or through the Services you consent to that transfer.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If under any such update we make
any material change to the way in which we treat your Personal Data or Usage Data, we
will inform you of such change via email or by posting a notice on relevant areas of our
Services. Any updated version of this privacy policy will be effective as of the date set
forth therein.</p>
