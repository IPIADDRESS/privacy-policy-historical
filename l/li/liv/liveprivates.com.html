					- When I've given my credit-card information to similar sites in the past,
					they abused it. How do I know I can trust you?</strong></p>
			<p class="answer1">A - LivePrivates is one of the fastest-growing web-conferencing
				and videochat services on the internet. With millions of registered users
				and over 9,000 registered video chathosts, both numbers growing every day,
				and with participation from more than 50 different countries. No company
				online or offline could ever hope to achieve that degree of success by engaging
				in abusive practices or by taking advantage of its customers. At LivePrivates,
				the Customer is King. You are king. We are extremely proud of our record
				for excellence in customer service.</p>
			<p class="question2"><strong>Q - How do I know my personal information is
					safe on your servers? What about hackers?</strong></p>
			<p class="answer1">A - Your registration information is always safe from hackers.
				All elements of the registration form (including this very message) are SSL-encrypted
				via Verisign digital certificates for your complete and total safety (look
				for the "closed padlock" icon when using Internet Explorer/AOL/Netscape
				or similar browsers). Since the beginning of our operation, 2001, our encrypted
				and firewall-protected systems have never suffered even a single serious
				security breach.</p>
			<p class="question2"><strong>Q - If I fill out the form, am I going to get
					slammed with junk email from 3rd parties?</strong></p>
			<p class="answer1">A - Perhaps with other internet services, but never with
				LivePrivates. LivePrivates never shares or sells your registration information,
				including your email address, with outside parties. Of course, if you contact
				any of LivePrivates's 9,000+ videochat hosts and exchange your contact information
				with a chathost, we can't prevent that chathost from sending you email, but
				that is your decision -- LivePrivates never makes that decision for you.</p></td>

				is a "Scam-Free Zone". What's that? If you've spent much time surfing
				the web, especially those sites that offer adult-oriented areas, you've learned
				(probably the hard way) not to give your credit-card number or other financial
				information to a website unless you're positive your personal and financial
				information won't be misused or abused by hackers or by anyone else (including
				the site itself).<br>
				First, on LivePrivates, your membership information is always safe
				from hackers. All elements of the registration form are SSL-encrypted via
				Verisign digital certificates for your complete and total safety (look for
				the "closed padlock" icon when using Internet Explorer/AOL/Netscape
				or similar browsers). Moreover, ever since our first day of operation on
				the internet (we've been online since the earliest days of the web), our
				encrypted and firewall-protected systems have never suffered even a single
				serious security incident.</p>
			<p class="answer1">Second, at LivePrivates, any personal information collected
				from you is kept strictly confidential and is for the limited purpose of
				identity verification to protect LivePrivates from abusive behavior. (E-commerce-enabled
				Chat services occasionally attract user misconduct such as identity theft,
				spam and other abuses. LivePrivates undertakes responsible measures to verify
				your identity, including matching your registration information against available
				verification databases and services. Of course, your privacy is respected
				and protected at all times). Any payment information collected will never
				be used to charge you for anything, unless you specifically authorize us
				to. You'll never be burned by LivePrivates. Ever. Other sites bury the fees
				and terms in the fine print (and some don't even care to mention them). But
				our plain-English Terms of Service explains in the first paragraph how it
				all works</p>

					LivePrivates Protects Your Privacy ?</strong></p>
			<p class="answer1">- We NEVER sell, rent or share your personal information
				or email address with any other party!<br>
				- We may send you occasional promotional emails, and every email
				will contain an unsubscribe option.<br>
				- Your personal information is NEVER stored on LivePrivates.com's
				server, so it cannot be stolen by hackers.</p>
			<p align="center" class="answer2"><strong>Not only do we respect your privacy,<br>
				we protect your privacy!!!</strong></p>
			<p class="answer1">LivePrivates is occasionally contacted by third parties
				who, for marketing purposes, want to purchase our mailing list and other
				sensitive customer information derived from our database. Although there
				is no law forbidding LivePrivates from selling such information, the trading
				of which is an extremely lucrative business, LivePrivates is serious in its
				commitment to protecting your personal privacy. We have never sold such personal
				information about our customers to outside parties -- not even once -- and
				we never will.</p>
			<p class="answer1">As a general rule, LivePrivates collects only three kinds
				of information about you: (1) Information that you voluntarily provide to
				us or authorize us to view, such as your name, address, credit-card and other
				account information as submitted on the LivePrivates Membership Submission
				Form, (2) "Log information" about the areas of LivePrivates that
				you visit, that are accessible from the general internet environment, and
				(3) private correspondence, such as the contents of e-mail messages you exchange
				with LivePrivates.</p>
			<p class="answer1">Log information bears greater explanation: Log information
				typically consists of such things as your browser type (i.e., Netscape or
				MSIE), your IP address (i.e., 102.316.52.11), the domain name from which
				you are visiting LivePrivates (i.e., "aol.com"), and the pages
				of LivePrivates that you visit. Like all internet services, we analyze our
				log files to better understand which areas of LivePrivates are more popular
				than others. And like most other large-scale internet properties, we also
				use this information to "customize" the LivePrivates experience
				to match your tastes. For example, if you first visit LivePrivates by searching
				an internet portal for a search term such as "voyeur" and clicking
				upon an LivePrivates banner or link, LivePrivates may set a "cookie" on
				your computer which records the term as a "search preference" (Note:
				Everyday log-analysis programs such as WebTrends include such tracking of
				keyword-specific traffic as a regular feature - indeed, using such tools,
				the administrators of most websites on earth track traffic originating from
				search engines by searched keyword). Later, as you navigate through LivePrivates,
				you will likely observe that the content you see on LivePrivates tends to
				be tailored to match your recorded search preference. Note: such cookies
				are "secure" in that they cannot be read by other internet companies,
				but can only be read by the web site which placed the cookie on your computer.</p>
			<p class="answer1">LivePrivates also uses your recorded "search preference" information
				to better target and allocate marketing expenditures. For example, if LivePrivates
				learns that, in aggregate, individuals who search portals for terms such
				as "voyeur" are more likely to purchase goods and services from
				LivePrivates than individuals who search for terms such as "livecams",
				LivePrivates may allocate greater portions of its marketing budget to targeting
				the former group, and a smaller portion of its budget to target the latter
				group. By optimizing marketing strategies in this manner, LivePrivates has
				more disposable capital that can be deployed toward development efforts which
				improve the LivePrivates platform and provide a richer customer experience
				for all.</p>
			<p class="answer1">Speaking of cookies, another kind of cookie that LivePrivates
				sets is an "identification cookie". This cookie is written whenever
				you successfully use your login and password to access a restricted area
				of LivePrivates; the identification cookie is available only to individuals
				who have already been verified as adults, via LivePrivates's verification
				procedures. When LivePrivates's servers observe this identification cookie
				on your computer, they recognize you and therefore might deliver unmodified
				content as opposed to modified content - in effect, another form of customized
				content tailored to suit your indicated preferences.</p>
			<p class="answer1">Another question that might concern you: "Does LivePrivates
				outsource to other companies any privacy-sensitive functions such as management
				of its email newsletter system, web hosting, or its e-commerce platform?" Because
				LivePrivates is committed to safeguarding the integrity of your personal
				information, we have elected to not use such services, despite the fact that
				they are reasonably-priced and simplify the management task of running a
				large and complex website operation.</p>
