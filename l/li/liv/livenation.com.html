("Live Nation," "we," "us").  Your privacy is important to Live Nation.  This Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") outlines the types of Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) that we gather while you are visiting the Site, as well as ways in which we process and disseminate such Personally Identifiable Information.  This Privacy Policy does not pertain to information collected on any other site owned by Live Nation, its subsidiaries or other businesses.  You are, of course, free to use much of the Site without providing any Personally Identifiable Information to us.</p>
                                        <p class="brBugFix">&nbsp;</p><p>Live Nation reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of this Privacy Policy.  Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted here, and we encourage you to check back from time to time to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version of our Privacy Policy.  You can determine whether the Privacy Policy has been revised since your previous visit to the Site by referring to the "Last Updated" legend at the top of this page.  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.  Your use of this Site constitutes your acceptance to be bound by this Privacy Policy without limitation, qualification or change.  If at any time you do not accept all the terms and conditions contained herein, you must immediately discontinue use of this Site.</p>
                                        <p class="brBugFix">&nbsp;</p><p>This Site is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of United States of America (USA).  Live Nation makes no representation that this Site is governed by or operated in accordance with the laws of other nations, or that the Site or any part thereof is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction.  Those who choose to access the Site do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations.  By using this Site and submitting any PII, visitors from outside of the USA acknowledge this Site is subject to USA law, consent to the transfer of PII to the USA, and waive any claims that may arise under their own national laws.</p>
                                        <p class="brBugFix">&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. What Information We Collect</strong></p>
                                        <p class="brBugFix">&nbsp;</p><p>Live Nation gathers two basic types of information through the Site: "Personally Identifiable Information (or "PII") and "Non-Personally Identifiable Information" (or "Non-PII").  Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies or can identify you as an individual and Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity.</p>
                                        <ol type="a">
                                        <li><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>
                                        When you visit and interact with the Site, Live Nation and third parties with whom Live Nation has contracted to provide services to Live Nation may collect Non-PII (for example, a catalog of the Site pages you visit).  Non-PII is generally collected through the Site from four different sources:  IP protocol addresses and web logs; cookies; pixel tags and other similar technologies; and information that you voluntarily provide.
                                        <ol type="i">
                                        <li><strong>IP Protocol Addresses and Web Logs</strong>
                                        This Site's web servers automatically collect the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and log files of visitors.  Your IP address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).  This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited.  We use your IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site's servers, and administering the Site.  Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Cookies</strong>
                                        We and our service providers may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the Site.  Cookies reside on your computer and help the Site recognize your computer's browser as a previous visitor.  In addition, on occasion our Site may also set a "session cookie" which helps us administer the Site.  The session cookie expires when you close your browser and does not retain any information about you after it expires.  If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you should be able to modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies.  For example, if you use a standard browser, you should have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set or to reject all cookies.  If you choose to reject cookies, you may be unable to use certain Site services (e.g., those services that require you to log on to the Site in order to participate).  For more information on modifying your browser preference, please refer to the documentation accompanying your browser.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Pixel Tags</strong>
                                        We and our service providers may also use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates.  A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors’ hard drives.  Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.  When used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Information You Voluntarily Provide</strong>
                                        We may also collect certain information (e.g., your geographic location, your genre preferences etc.) when you voluntarily provide such information to us.  When such information is not combined with any PII, such information is considered to be Non-PII, as it does not personally identify you or any other user.  Additionally, we may aggregate PII in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using PII to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code.  Such aggregate information is considered Non-PII for purposes of this Policy.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong> You may use many features of this Site without providing any PII.  However, in order to take advantage of particular opportunities made available through the Site (for example, to access additional services provided by this Site such as concert updates, chat room forums and/or personalized content) we may require that you furnish PII to us such as:  your name, postal address, telephone number, fax number email address, age, gender, credit card number or other payment account number and health-related information (for example, physically disabled seating requests).  Please keep in mind that you may also be providing PII when you submit comments through chat rooms, forums, message boards or news groups.  We collect PII from you through the Site only when you voluntarily provide it</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p class="brBugFix">&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. How Information We Collect Is Used</strong></p>
                                        <ol type="a">
                                        <li><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong> Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose.  For example, we may use Non-PII to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Site and pages viewed as well as to diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Site.  We may then use this information to analyze and improve the features and functionality of this Site.  We may use information about you and other Site visitors on an aggregate basis to sell and deliver advertising, promotions and content that we believe will be of interest to you.
                                        <br><br>In addition, we reserve the right to share such Non PII, which does not personally identify you, with third parties, for any purpose.  For example, we may share information with advertisers or other third parties that are not part of the Live Nation family on an aggregate or other basis that does not disclose your identity or contact information.
                                        <br><br>In some instances, we may combine Non-PII with PII (such as embedding email addresses in cookies).  If we do combine any Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated as PII as long as it is so combined.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>
                                        <ol type="i">
                                        <li><strong>Site:</strong>  We may use PII you give us to better tailor your website experience to your interests, and to show you content in which you may be interested and to display the content according to your preferences.  We may also share your PII within the Live Nation business family in order to enhance your experience on other Live Nation websites.</li> 
                                        <li><strong>Communications:</strong>  If you choose to opt-in, we may use your PII to send you information about Live Nation and its services as well as promotional material on behalf of some of our partners.  If at any time you change your mind and prefer to no longer receive such marketing communications from us, please see the <strong>"Opt-In Policy"</strong> section below.</li> 
                                        <li><strong>Administrative Matters:</strong>  Live Nation reserves the right to contact you in the event of a change in the Site's Terms of Use and/or this Privacy Policy, or to notify you of other administrative matters in connection with the Site (e.g., contacting you to facilitate, complete or confirm a transaction).  Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications.</li>

We will use the Payment Information that you provide to bill you for your purchase and to fulfill your purchase.  By providing your Payment Information, you are authorizing us to give that information to third parties as necessary to confirm and fulfill your order (for example, to process your credit card or payment account number and to send you products you have ordered).</li>

If you wish to use this feature, you may provide us with such other party’s email address Instant Messenger screen names or so that we can facilitate your sending of such message to such other party.  To do so, any PII you provide in connection with sending such other party the message, such as your name and your email address or Instant Messenger screen name, will, of course, be disclosed to such other party.  While, due to technical restrictions, the recipient's email address or Instant Messenger screen names may be retained in our log files, we do not knowingly share it with third parties (unless the recipient has already consented to such use of his/her PII).</li>  
                                        <li><strong>Online Surveys/Sweepstakes and Contests:</strong> From time to time, we conduct online surveys and offer online sweepstakes or contests on the Site (each, a "Promotion"), and we may collect PII in connection with the same.  We may use your PII to contact you regarding your Promotion entry, or to contact you if you win a Promotion (if applicable).  You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate through the Site, as they may contain additional important information about Live Nation's use of your PII.  To the extent such rules conflict with this Privacy Policy, such rules will govern that particular Promotion.</li>

                                        When you provide PII to one of our Site’s e-commerce partners, vendors or advertisers, this transaction will occur in connection with the site of the e-commerce partner, vendor or advertiser, not on the Site, and, as such, the PII you provide is collected pursuant to and controlled by the privacy policy of such e-commerce partner, vendor or advertiser.  Live Nation is not responsible for such parties' privacy policies and we encourage you to familiarize yourself with the applicable privacy policy of the e-commerce site with which you transact business or to contact the operator of such site for more information.
