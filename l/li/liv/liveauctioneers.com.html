        <p class="style3"><strong> OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
        <p class="style3"> We use your information to provide you with access to our site and
          services. We also use your information to contact you to inform you
          of our services, offerings, or information you may have requested.

          all of your private communications and other personal information will

          Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may
          be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third
          parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept
          or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse
          or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site.
          Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your
          privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal
          information or private communications will always remain private.<strong><br>
          </strong>        </p>

          access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure appropriate use of information,
          we use industry leading technical and administrative practices and
          procedures to safeguard and secure your information.</p>
        <p class="style3"><strong> NOTICE</strong></p>
        <p class="style3"> We may occasionally choose to amend this privacy policy to better
          reflect our use and protection of your information. In the event of
          amendment, all terms shall become effective within 15 days after they
