	<h3>Our relationship with Restaurants</h3>

	<p>While we generally act as a data controller when you use our services directly, when you use our websites or mobile apps, we provide our booking services to the third parties for example, restaurants. When we provide our services to restaurants, for example, where a restaurant uses our booking platform on their own website, the restaurants engage us as a service provider. This means that we are not the data controller and we act as a data processor on behalf of the restaurants. We are not in control of any information where a restaurant acts as a data controller and you should ensure that you review each restaurant’s privacy policy where applicable.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="pp-h8">
	<h3>Where we store your personal information</h3>

	<p>All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers within UK or EEA. Unless you are told otherwise in any specific privacy notices provided by us, we do not transfer any personal information outside the EEA.</p>

	<p>While we are committed to keeping your personal information secure, the transmission of information online via the internet is not completely secure. We, together with our service providers will do our best to protect your personal information but information provided is at your sole risk.</p>

	<ul><li><strong>Restaurants</strong> - we share Booking Data, reviews, where applicable Payment Data and other relevant information you provide us with the Restaurants that you request services from. This information is provided to the Restaurants to enable them to continue to process and manage your booking. Once we pass your information to the Restaurant, the Restaurant takes the role of Data Controller and we become the Data Processor.</li>
		<li><strong>Partner Networks </strong>– where you book a Restaurant through one of our Partner Networks, for example a third party restaurant reservation website, we share Booking Data, reviews and other relevant information you provide us with that Partner Network. We will never share Payment Data with Partner Networks. Once we pass your information to the Partner Network, the Partner Network takes the role of Data Controller for that data.</li>
		<li><strong>Payment and billing providers</strong> – to make a reservation at some restaurants, you are required to make a deposit or provide your credit or debit card information to secure your reservation.

		<p>These service providers are legally obligated to keep the personal information they may have received confidential and secure and to use your personal information the basis of our instructions only.</p>

		<p>We may also share your personal information with third parties:</p>

		<ul><li>In the event that we sell or transfer any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal information to the prospective purchaser or recipient of such business or assets.</li>

For more specific retention periods, please see section 5 above.

	<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="pp-h11">
