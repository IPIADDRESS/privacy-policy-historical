<p>When your web browser or e-mail application requests a web page or e-mail from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information.

<h3 id="_Cookies"><strong>6.&nbsp;Cookies</strong></h3>
&nbsp;
<p>Like many other websites, we use "cookies" to help us gather and store information about visitors to our websites. This notice provides you with information about how we use cookies and how you can control them.&nbsp; By using this website you accept the use of cookies in accordance with this notice. If you do not accept the use of these cookies, please see the section below entitled ‘How do I disable/enable cookies?’ for further instructions.</p>

<p>A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can track unique visitors, recognise returning visitors and remember a visitor’s preferences. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device.</p>

<p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. You can find more information about cookies at: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>7. What types of cookies are used on this site?</strong></h3>
&nbsp;
<p>We use two broad categories of cookies:</p>

<ul class="bullet" style="margin-left: 18px">

	<li><strong>Third party cookies</strong>, served by a third party on our behalf. We use third party cookies to help us analyse our websites and their uses, and to enable tailored advertising.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>8.&nbsp;What do we use cookies for?&nbsp; </strong></h3>
&nbsp;
<p><strong>Category 1: Strictly Necessary Cookies </strong></p>

<p>These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies services you have asked for, like shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.</p>

<p>We may also use a Social Sharing Cookie. This is a cookie that identifies you with social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter and allows interaction between your activity on social networking sites and on our website through your direction, and makes your transition between the sites more seamless.</p>

<p><strong>Category 2: Performance Cookies</strong></p>

<p>These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a website works.</p>

<h3><strong>10. What type of Performance Cookies do we use on on our website?</strong></h3>
&nbsp;
<p>We use Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics to help analyse use of the site. This analytical tool uses cookies to collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information in an anonymous and aggregate form. The information about your use of the website and your IP address is transmitted to Google and Adobe and is used by us to evaluate visitors' use of the website, compile statistical reports on website activity and create a profile of aggregated visitors using Google Analytics demographics and interests. We also use Google Display Network Impression Reporting to understand which adverts we place on other websites in the Google Display Network are better at helping us attract visitors to our website. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites visit&nbsp; <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;To delete performance cookies, please refer to section 12.</p>

<p><strong>Category 3: Functionality Cookies</strong></p>

<p>These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing in a cookie the region in which you are currently located. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.</p>

<h3><strong>11. What type of Functionality Cookies do we use on our website?</strong></h3>
&nbsp;
<p>With your consent we may place a cookie to remember your preferences (Preference Cookie) so that you do not need to re-enter your details (country/age and language preferences) on our gateway page. This is not suitable if you share your computer with someone else.&nbsp; This cookie expires automatically after 12 months.</p>

<p>We may also use Session Cookies, which are temporary cookies that aid the user journey around the site, and will remember preferences you have selected during the session. These cookies are deleted as soon as you leave the site.</p>

<p><strong>Category 4: Targeting Cookies or Advertising Cookies</strong></p>

<p>These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.</p>

<h3 id="_Disclosure_of_personal"><strong>15.&nbsp;Disclosure of personal information</strong></h3>

<p>We value your personal information and only share it with third parties that provide it with adequate protection.&nbsp; From time to time we may disclose personal information&nbsp; to:</p>

<ol class="bullet" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
	<li>third parties to whom you have provided your consent;</li>
	<li>our service providers and subcontractors, including our affiliates, retained to perform functions on our behalf, or to provide services to us (such as warehousing and delivery; marketing and advertising; credit card and data processing; age verification; software development; website hosting and management; information technology and office services; legal, accounting, audit and other professional service providers; and other services related to our business), provided such service providers and subcontractors have entered into written agreements with us and do not collect, use, or disclose the personal information for any purpose other than to perform such functions on our behalf, to provide services to us, or as otherwise required by law;</li>
	<li>third parties who, in our reasonable judgment, are providing or seeking the information as your authorized or appointed legal agent; or</li>
	<li>We will obtain your express permission before we allow a third party that is not an affiliate to send you any marketing and promotional information;</li>
	<li>a person or entity, including our affiliates, in the event of a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, financing, reorganization, or liquidation whereby we transfer, sell, or assign to such third party information concerning your relationship with us, including without limitation, personally identifiable information that you provide and other information concerning your relationship with us;</li>

	<li>When you breach this Notice or the Terms of use of the site.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<h3 id="_Public_areas_of"><strong>16.&nbsp;Public areas of our websites</strong></h3>
&nbsp;
<p>Information that you post on or through the public areas of the site (e.g., chat rooms, bulletin boards, discussion groups, or Social Networking modules) generally is accessible to, and may be collected and used by, others, and may result in unsolicited messages or other contact from others. You should not provide personal information about yourself in public (or interactive) areas of the site.&nbsp; Such personal information is not covered under this Privacy and Cookie Notice.</p>

<h3><strong>17.&nbsp;Security</strong></h3>
&nbsp;
<p>We take security seriously and take precautions to keep your personal information secure. We have implemented security practices and procedures and have a comprehensively documented information security programme and information security policies with adequate managerial, technical, operational and physical security control measures to safeguard against any non-disclosure of your personal information that we collect. However, we have no control over the privacy of any communication while it is in transit to us. We therefore recommend that you not include confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information in any such communications.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp; If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at the contact details below.In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If such a notification is appropriate, we will endeavour to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your email address, we may notify you by email.</p>

<p>You are&nbsp;reminded that, in accordance with the Terms of Use for this website, which include this Privacy and Cookie Notice, you are&nbsp;responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you are responsible for any activity under your account and password. &nbsp;It is your sole responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your account, and notify&nbsp;us when you wish to cancel your account.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this&nbsp;obligation.</p>

<p>While USL will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that your personal information and other information submitted by you is safe and secure, it offers no representation, warranties or other assurances that the security measures are adequate, safe, fool proof or impenetrable.</p>

<h3><strong>18.&nbsp;Unsubscribe, access, questions and further information</strong></h3>

Where you choose to provide specific opt-out requests (including requests where you previously opted in with respect to the use of your personal information), you will not be able to use all the functionalities of the site or receive certain services rendered pursuant to the site.</p>

<h3><strong>19. Retention period</strong></h3>
&nbsp;

<p>If you would like to unsubscribe from this communication, or from all communications about Diageo brands, please contact: admin@liveinstyle.com</p>

<h3 id="_Portfolio_permissions"><strong>20.&nbsp;Portfolio permissions</strong></h3>
&nbsp;
<p>If you have given permission to receive communications about Diageo brands generally (for example, by opting to receive news and special offers by email about Diageo’s other great alcohol brands), you may from time to time receive communications about brands to which you have not opted in specifically. Information about many of Diageo’s brands can be found at <a href="http://www.diageobrands.com/">www.diageobrands.com</a>.</p>

<p>We occasionally may send you communications about brands not featured on <a href="http://www.diageobrands.com/">www.diageobrands.com</a> (e.g., new brands). We recommend that you refer to <a href="http://www.diageobrands.com/">www.diageobrands.com</a> from time to time as the list of featured brands will be updated periodically.</p>

<p>Providing general permission for us to communicate with you about our brands does not mean that you will receive communications about all of Diageo’s brands. We will only communicate with you about those brands that we think may be of particular interest to you. Any such communications will provide you with an opportunity to unsubscribe from the brand in question and/or from all communications about Diageo brands.</p>

<p>If you have any privacy-related questions, concerns or complaints, please contact: admin@liveinstyle.com</p>

<p>This Privacy and Cookie Notice will be supplemented by additional legal requirements in jurisdictions where we conduct business as required. Nothing in this Privacy and Cookie Notice or otherwise will create, or add to, any right or claim (whether legal, equitable, or otherwise) that any individual or person may have at law or otherwise against the company or any third party, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, or representatives (collectively the “Diageo Group”), nor will the existence of this Privacy and Cookie Notice or its application impose or add to any obligations upon or create any liability for the Diageo Group that it does not already otherwise have under law.</p>
