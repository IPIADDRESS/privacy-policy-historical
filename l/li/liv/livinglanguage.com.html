<p id="personal-info"><strong>Controllers of Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>Any personal information provided to or to be gathered by Random House is controlled primarily by Random House LLC, 1745 Broadway, New York, NY 10019.</p>

<p id="what-info"><strong>What Information About Me Is Collected and Stored?</strong></p>

<p>We collect two basic types of information from you in conjunction with your use of the Sites, personal information and non-personal information.  Personal information is information that you may supply to us, as described more fully below, i.e., when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for a Site or any part thereof, enter a contest, upload content, participate in a community, or provide your e-mail address.  Personal information is any information that can individually identify you and includes your name, e-mail address, telephone number, postal address, credit card, billing and contact information.  Non-personal information includes information that does not personally identify you but may include tracking and usage information about your location, demographics, use of the Sites and the Internet.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>As a general matter, you can browse the Sites without submitting your personal information to us.  However, there are a number of circumstances in which you may supply us with your personal information.  The following lists the most common ways in which we may collect your personal information.</p>
<ul class="bullets-outside">
<li>Registration for an account on the Sites</li>
<li>Sign up to receive e-mail newsletters from us</li>
<li>Request for customer service or other assistance</li>
<li>Participation in surveys, panels, or market research</li>
<li>Participation in special events and promotions</li>
<li>Purchases on the Sites</li>
<li>Entry in contests or sweepstakes</li> 
<li>Participation on social media accounts involving Random House, our books and our brands</li>
<li>Participation in communities, chat rooms, and other interactive services</li>
<li>Submission of user generated content on any part of the Sites that permit it</li>
<li>Submission of a job application</li>
<li>Any other place on the Sites where you knowingly volunteer personal information</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Collection of Personal Information From Social Media Sites</strong></p>

<p>When you interact with any Random House property page or account on a social media platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, YouTube, or Pinterest, we may collect the personal information that you make available to us on that page or account including your account ID or "handle." However, we will comply with the privacy policies of the corresponding social media platform and we will only collect and store such personal information that we are permitted to collect by these social media platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>In addition, when you interact with the Sites, our servers may keep an activity log that does not identify you individually ("Non-Personal Information"). Generally, we collect and store the following categories of Non-Personal Information:</p>
<ul class="bullets-outside">
<li>Demographic data such as age, gender, and five digit zip code as part of collecting personal information</li>
<li>Device information about your computer, mobile device, or other device that you use to access the Sites. This information may include IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language, and other transactional information.</li>
<li>Usage information about your use of the Sites.  This information includes a reading history of the pages you view.  We use this information to provide you a more customized experience on the Sites.</li>
<li>Additional "traffic data" such as time of access, date of access, software crash reports, session identification number, access times, and referring website addresses.</li>
<li>Your search terms and search results.</li>
<li>Other information regarding our users' use of the Sites.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Collection of Your Source IP Address/Location Information</strong></p>

<p>We collect and store your device's source IP address which may disclose the location of your device at the time you access the Sites.  Advertisements and certain content may be directed to you as a result of this data.</p>

<p>In addition, in some cases the Sites can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature.  If you enable that feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device which will be used by the Sites to serve you certain content tied to your location.  If you elect to have your location-based searches saved to your history, we will store such information on our servers.</p>

<p><strong>Collection of Personal and Non-Personal Information From Other Sources</strong></p>

<p>We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources to, among other things, enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database and to better customize your experience on the Sites.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Cookies, Flash Cookies and Web Beacons</strong></p>

<p>Like many websites, we use "cookies", which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences and actions. We use cookies to track use of our Sites and online services. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Sites and make it easier and/or relevant for your use.  You may occasionally get cookies from companies advertising on our behalf.  We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to this cookie policy.</p>

<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. For more information on cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>

<p>We may also use web beacons or flash cookies.  A web beacon or flash cookie (also known as "action tags", "tracer tags", or "single-pixel gifs") is an invisible graphic on a web page that is programmed to collect non-personal  information about your use of a given website. We do not share or provide personal information we may collect through such web beacons, such as names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers with our advertisers without your express permission.</p>

<p>We work with third-party advertising companies who may utilize flash or enhanced cookies or web beacons to better provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. These partners do not have access to or use your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personal information from us.  They may, however, anonymously track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond these Sites.  To learn more about the use of this information or to choose not to have this information used by our third-party advertising partners by opting out please visit the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</p>

<p id="children"><strong>Is Personal Information Collected From Children?</strong></p>

<p>Unless otherwise disclosed during collection and with parent or guardian consent, Random House does not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age you should not under any circumstance provide personally identifiable information to Random House. If Random House discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided Random House with personally identifiable information, Random House will immediately delete that child's information from the Sites.</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party Agents</strong></p>

<p>We have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and partners that perform functions on our behalf, such as hosting, billing, marketing, analytics, customer service, fraud protection, etc.  These entities have access to the Personal Information needed to perform their functions and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that Personal Information.  They are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to the Sites.</p>

<p><strong>Business Partners and Third Parties</strong></p>

<p>We may share your Personal Information with our business partners or co-marketers from time to time.  We may also share your Personal Information with third parties that provide products and services that we think you may be interested in.

We will also disclose Non-Personal Information to our partners and other third parties about how our users collectively use the Sites.</p>

<p id="what"><strong>What Steps Are Taken To Keep Personal Information Secure?</strong></p>

<p>We are concerned about ensuring the security of your Personal Information.  We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your device to our servers.  Personal Information collected by our Sites is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public.  Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose your Personal Information to you.  Please understand, however, that while we try our best to safeguard your Personal Information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

<p id="right"><strong>Your Obligations to Keep Your Access Rights Secure</strong></p>

<p>You promise to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and your business as prompted by a Website's registration form (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Random House has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Random House has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Sites (or any portion thereof).  You are entirely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account.</p>

<p id="links"><strong>What Happens When I Link To or From Another Website?</strong></p>

<p>These Sites may contain links to other websites operated by affiliates of Random House or third parties. Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy for Random House do not apply to information gathered through these other websites. We are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third parties and other websites.</p>

<p id="contests"><strong>What About Contests and Sweepstakes?</strong></p>

<p>When we run a contest or sweepstakes relating to our Sites, it will be accompanied by a set of rules. The rules for each contest/sweepstakes will specify how the information gathered from you for entry will be used and disclosed, if it is different than as described in this Privacy Policy.  In conjunction with your entry in such contest or sweepstakes, Personal Information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it to.</p>

<p id="community"><strong>Public Areas, Chat Rooms, Reviews, and Community Areas</strong></p>

<p>Please remember that any information you share in public areas, such as message boards or feedback sections, becomes public and anyone may take and use that information.  Please be careful about what you disclose and do not post any Personal Information that you expect to keep private.  Please consult the applicable guidelines, if any, for use of our chat rooms and other community areas for more information.</p>

<p id="governing-law"><strong>Governing Law</strong></p>

<p>These Sites are published in the United States. We attempt to protect the Personal Information of all users of our Sites and we attempt to comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws to the extent they may apply to the Random House services, but our family of Sites are located and targeted to United States citizens and our policies are directed at compliance with those laws.  If you are uncertain whether this privacy policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy laws where you are located, you should not submit your Personal Information to Random House.</p>

<p id="assignment"><strong>Assignment</strong></p>

<p>We may change our ownership or corporate organization while providing the Sites and services.  We may also sell certain assets associated with the Sites.  As a result, please be aware that in such event we may transfer some or all of your information to a company acquiring all or part of our assets or to another company with which we have merged.  Under such circumstances we would, to the extent possible, require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time.  Nevertheless, we cannot promise that an acquiring company or the merged company will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p id="non-us"><strong>Notice to Non-US Users</strong></p>

<p>If you are located outside the United States of America, you should be aware that your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the United States of America, the laws of which may be deemed by the your country to have inadequate data protection. If you are located in a country outside the United States of America and voluntarily submit personal information to us, you thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this privacy policy and to the transfer of that information to, and/or storage of that information in, the United States of America.</p>

<p id="changes"><strong>Changes to This Policy</strong></p>

<p>As our Sites continue to develop, we may add new services and features to our Sites. In the event that these additions affect our Privacy Policy, this document will be updated appropriately.  We will post those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.  We do, however, recommend that you read this Privacy Policy each time you use our Sites in case you missed our notice of changes to the Privacy Policy.  We will not, however, materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of Personal Information we have previously collected from you without your express consent.</p>

<p id="opt-out"><strong>How Do I Opt-Out or Correct Information About Me</strong></p>

<p>You may always opt-out of receiving future e-mail messages and newsletters from Random House.  We provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request information about you.  To do so, you can send us a message at listmaster@randomhouse.com.</p>

To make such a request, please send an e-mail to ecustomerservice@randomhouse.com.</p>
