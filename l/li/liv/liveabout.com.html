            <p>
                At LiveAbout, we take online privacy seriously and we respect the concerns of 
                our community of users. In this policy (the “Privacy Policy”) we describe our 
                privacy practices with regard to information we collect through LiveAbout.com 
                and affiliated sites and email properties (collectively, the “Site“), 
                to help you make informed decisions about how you 
                share information when you visit or use the site.
            </p>
            <p>
                </p><h3>Understanding How Information Is Collected on LiveAbout:</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                </p><h4>Information You May Choose to Provide to Us</h4>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                We may collect information, including personal data,
                directly from you if you choose to provide that information. For example,
                you may provide us with your name and contact information (such as an email
                address), date of birth, or other details of that nature, when you sign up
                for our newsletters or participate in promotions or surveys on the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
                You also may choose to provide personally data about
                yourself when you participate in forums or discussions on the Site. 
                Please be aware that information you post may be
                viewed or captured by anyone who visits the Site, therefore you should
                avoid posting sensitive or personal data that you would not want to
                be available to the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                </p><h4>Information That Is Automatically Collected When You Visit LiveAbout</h4>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                When you access the Site, we and our third-party partners may automatically 
                collect certain information about your visit using tools such as cookies, web beacons, 
                and other similar technologies. The information collected automatically when you visit 
                the Site may include your IP address, characteristics of your operating system, 
                information about your browser and system settings, data about the computer 
                or mobile device you use to access the Site, unique device identifiers, 
                clickstream data (which shows the page-by-page path you take as you browse the Site). 
                We or our third-party partners may combine information that each of us collects 
                automatically with other information about you, including information you choose to provide.

                <b>Cookies</b> are small files that websites and other online services use to store 
                information about users on the users’ own computers. This Site may use cookies 
                (such as HTTP and HTML5 cookies and Flash cookies), as well as other types of local

                you choose to disable cookies, that could affect certain features of the
                Site that use cookies to enhance their functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                To manage our automatic data collection, we may place tags (often referred 
                to as “web beacons”) on pages on the Site or in emails we send to you.&nbsp;
                <b>Web beacons</b>&nbsp;are small files that link web pages to particular web servers 
                and their cookies, and they may be used for a variety of purposes, such as 
                counting the number of visitors to the Site, analyzing how users navigate 
                around the Site, assessing how many emails that we send are actually opened 
                and which articles or links are viewed by visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also use third-party web analytics services, such as Google Analytics, 
                on the Site, to provide us with statistics and other information about visitors to the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>“Do Not Track” Signals.</b>
                Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “do not track” 
                signal to websites and online services you visit. At this time there is 
                no consensus among industry participants as to the meaning of “do not track” 
                in this context. Like many other websites, LiveAbout.com is not 
                configured to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers.&nbsp;

                Finally, companies that provide certain third-party apps, tools, widgets, 
                and plug-ins that may appear on the Site (for example, Facebook “Like” 
                buttons), also may use automated means to collect information regarding 
                your interactions with these features. This information collection is 
                subject to the privacy policies or notices of those providers.
