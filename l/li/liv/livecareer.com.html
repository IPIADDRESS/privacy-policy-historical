<p class="headingPP">LIVECAREER PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p>Effective Date: May 01, 2013</p>
<p>LiveCareer Limited (“LiveCareer”, "us", "our" or "we") has developed this Privacy Policy which details important information regarding our collection, use and disclosure of user information. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected on our family of websites, which are owned and/or controlled by LiveCareer (collectively, the “Sites”), and other interactive properties, including but not limited to our mobile applications (the Sites and other LiveCareer interactive properties are collectively referred to herein as the “LiveCareer Applications"). This Privacy Policy also applies to our offline collection of information. LiveCareer provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use the services provided by LiveCareer and/or assessed through the LiveCareer Applications or offline ("Services"). This Privacy Policy applies to your use of (1) the LiveCareer Applications (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise); (2) email or electronic catalogs and newsletters; and (3) any other means or applications in which you connect with us or our products and services.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Use. Each time that you access, register and/or use LiveCareer Applications or our Services you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the Terms of Use, and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the LiveCareer Applications or Services.</p>
<p class="subheadingPP">We use information about you as set forth in more detail in this Privacy Policy to:</p>
<p class="subheadingP">I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
<p class="subheadingPP">Information Provided Directly by You To LiveCareer</p>
<p><strong>Registration Information.</strong> We will collect personal information from you if you register on our LiveCareer Applications or use or subscribe to our Services. When you register you are required to provide your email address and password.</p>
<p><strong>Required Information.</strong> Certain categories of information may also be required depending on the product or service you are using, such as name, address, year of birth, education level, degree or career course of interest and other information relevant to the service you select. For some products, you are required to provide other information in the form of uploaded documents as well as resume information, contact information, career objectives, employment history and job descriptions. LiveCareer asks for this information so that you are able to use and maximize the effectiveness of our career tools and have the best possible experience with LiveCareer. The use of services which require the input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part. You have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of LiveCareer Applications.</p>
<p><strong>Optional Information.</strong> At various other points during your visit to LiveCareer, you may be asked to provide information about yourself that is not related to a particular service such as an area of study, degrees or careers that interest you. The input of this optional information is completely voluntary on your part but may enable us to provide you with information to further help your work life.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback.</strong> In addition, you may provide feedback, ideas, suggestions, and/or proposals (“Feedback”) with regard to our products and services. Submission of Feedback is optional, although encouraged, as it allows LiveCareer to better address our users’ needs and continuously work towards improving our products and services. If at any time you provide Feedback, you acknowledge and agree that (1) such Feedback do not contain confidential or proprietary information; (2) LiveCareer will be entitled to use or disclose (or choose not to disclose) any such Feedback for any purpose, in any way, in any media worldwide; (3) you irrevocably assign to LiveCareer all rights to your Feedback; (4) LiveCareer is not under any obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Feedback; and (5) you are not entitled to any compensation or reimbursement of any kind from LiveCareer under any circumstances for submission or use of your Feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Billing Information.</strong> While many products and services on LiveCareer Applications are provided free, some require payment from you by the method of payments accepted by us (“Billing Information”). We collect, and, if you are purchasing an automatically renewing subscription from us, we may store your Billing Information but this information is only shared with third parties who perform tasks on our behalf to verify, update and complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders, customer service functions and processing charges to your chosen payment method provider.</p>
<p><strong>Surveys and Promotions.</strong>From time-to-time we may request information from you and other users via surveys or promotions. Participation in these surveys or promotions which might include contests or sweepstakes is completely voluntary so you and other users have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact and demographic information. Contact information may be used to notify the winners and award prizes and file winners’ information, as required by law. Survey information will be used for the purpose of administering your participation in the survey, and the monitoring or improvement of the use and satisfaction of LiveCareer Applications or other career, employment, education, workforce and other services that will help you advance your working life.</p>
<p class="subheadingPP">Information Contained in Your Resume, Cover Letters or Interactive Posts</p>
<p>The Services contain the ability to communicate interactively and other mechanisms designed to enable you to communicate with others or to post content on LiveCareer Applications and on other third party sites, which may include bulletin boards and career, employment, education, workforce and other services that will help you advance your working life (the “Communication Services”). Please remember that any information you disclose while participating in the Communication Services becomes public information and is subject to redistribution by LiveCareer. You should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose any personal information in a submission or posting. There is no expectation of privacy when posting, or otherwise participating on the Communication Services. If you post content, such as your contact information or other personally identifiable information on your resume, cover letter, or in other content using the Communication Services, please be aware that any information contained in such content is accessible to other users of the particular LiveCareer Application or Communication Service, including where your information has been posted on third party sites, and we have no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information and have no responsibility for and do not endorse how those third parties may use your information. You should check the privacy policies of those third parties prior to posting any content which could be shared. We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the Communication Services. We reserve the right to take action in connection with any content we deem to be inappropriate. Please review our Terms of Use for more information regarding your appropriate use of these Communication Services.</p>

<p class="subheadingPP">Information You Provide About a Third Party</p>
<p>If you send someone else a communication from the LiveCareer Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please ensure that you only send communications to friends or colleagues who would want to receive the information you send. If that person becomes a customer or registers with us, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other customers or registered users. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the LiveCareer Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend</p>
<p class="subheadingPP">Information We Collect From Third Parties</p>
<p>We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address, your billing information, or other demographic and lifestyle information.

You expressly consent to our communicating with you using this contact information about LiveCareer products and services and, unless you opt out of such sharing, to share your contact information with third parties. In addition, if you have chosen to participate in some of our career building Services, your contact information obtained directly from you or which is provided on documents you submit to us may be provided to third parties such as (i) resume editors, (ii) employers or recruiters who might contact you about career opportunities, and/or (iii) career, employment, education, workforce and other services providers, to will help you advance your working life (collectively, “Career Service Providers”).

<p class="subheadingP">Your California Privacy Rights (As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</p>
<p>California’s "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. If you do not want us to send you emails regarding special promotions or offers or share your email address with third parties so that they can send you emails about their products and services, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions that are located at the bottom of those emails or you can log onto My Account” and click the “My Settings” and “Preferences” links. If you do not want us to send you any offers from third parties through postal direct mail or share your name and mailing address with third parties so that they can send you postal direct mail offers about their products and services, please send an email to <a href="mailto:directmail@livecareer.com">DirectMail@LiveCareer.com</a> or write to North America LiveCareer, Inc., acting on behalf of LiveCareer Limited, 1 Hallidie Plaze Ste 306 San Francisco, CA 94102 ATTN: Marketing. California customers may request further information about our approach to this law by contacting us.</p>
<p><strong>Children's Privacy.</strong> The LiveCareer Applications are intended for general adult audiences and you represent that you are over the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence in accordance with LiveCareer’s Terms of Use.
