To the extent we collect credit card information, we do not share that information with any third parties except to the extent necessary to complete a transaction.  We also do not store complete credit card information (meaning we do not store your entire credit card number) unless you ask us to in connection with a subscription-based product.  All credit card information is removed from our systems at your request.

The types of passive information collected by this Site include, without limitation, your IP address, which type of browser you are using, how you came to our Site, where you go on our Site and how long you stay on any part of our Site.

 With respect to information you provide during our registration process, LiveCareer gives you the option not to receive electronic communications from LiveCareer and third parties.  If you do not opt-out, personal information about you (such as your contact information and other information collected during your visit to LiveCareer) may be shared with colleges, universities, potential employers, recruiters/headhunters, data aggregators, marketers (possibly in the form of list rental or license) and other organizations.

   These selected third parties may use your personal information to provide you with promotional materials about goods and services offered by them.
