color:black">Overview</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">This Privacy
Policy describes how LiveDeal treats the personal information that LiveDeal
collects and receives through its web site. Personal information is information
about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email
address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This
policy does not apply to the practices of companies that LiveDeal does not own
or control or to people that LiveDeal does not employ or manage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">By your use of
the LiveDeal web site, you expressly consent to our disclosure and use of your
personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">We reserve the
right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, and will notify you of any
such changes by posting a notice on the "General Announcements" section of the
Community page of our web site. In addition, we may notify you directly (via
email) of such changes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">We last updated
our Privacy Policy on Mar 23, 2004.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold1"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black">1. A Special Note About Children</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Children
(persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to use the web site unsupervised
and we ask that children do not submit any personal information to us. If you
are under the age of 18, you may use the web site only in conjunction with and
under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold1"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black">2. Information Collection and Use</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">LiveDeal collects
personal information from our users at several different points on our web
site. This includes when you register with LiveDeal and when you conduct
certain activities on the web site.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">When you
register, we ask for information such as your name, address, telephone number,
email address, city, state and zip code. We may also ask you for credit card
information to enable us to bill you fees for our services. Once you register
with LiveDeal and login to our services, you are not anonymous to us. However,
you can browse our web site without telling us who you are or revealing
personal information about yourself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">When you wish
to contact a seller regarding an item listed on our web site, we ask you for
your email address and you may also volunteer to provide your telephone number.
In addition, each member may provide information about the buyers with whom
they deal (including the email address, and feedback regarding the other
member's&nbsp; performance during the transaction).&nbsp; Finally, we may also collect
the Internet Protocol (IP) address and other information regarding transactions
in which you participate (either as a buyer or seller) through our web site.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">We use the
information that we collect to improve product offerings, fulfill your
requests, bill you for services, customize the web site's content and layout,
develop feedback ratings, contact you, and for marketing activities and
statistical analysis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">If you elect to
use our referral service to inform a friend about our web site, we ask you for
the friend's name and email address. We will automatically send the friend a
one-time email inviting him or her to visit our web site. We store this
information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking
the success of our referral program.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">LiveDeal
automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your
browser, including your IP address, LiveDeal cookies information, and the page
you request. Our collection and use of such information is further described
below.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold1"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black">3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">LiveDeal is the
sole owner of the information collected on <a href="http://www.livedeal.com/index.jsp">www.livedeal.com</a>. We will not
rent, sell or share your personal information with anyone except under the
following circumstances:</span></p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Arial">Other visitors to our web site may view your member ID,
     feedback rating, city, region and items or messages that you have posted
     on our web site. </span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Arial">In order to complete a transaction, the buyer and
     seller will communicate directly. To enable such communications, we will
     disclose a buyer's email address and (where the buyer has chosen to
     provide such information) telephone number to the seller.</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Arial">We provide information about our users to trusted
     partners who work on our behalf pursuant to confidentiality agreements.&nbsp;
     Pursuant to the terms of their agreements, these companies do not have any
     independent right to share or use such information.</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Arial">We may disclose user information in response to
     subpoenas, court orders or legal process, or to establish or exercise our
     legal rights or defend against legal claims.</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Arial">We may disclose user information when we believe such
     disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding
     illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats
     to the physical safety of any person, violations of our User Agreement, or
     as otherwise required by law.</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Arial">We may transfer information about you if we are
     acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, we will notify
     you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a
     different privacy policy.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Of course, once
you provide personal information to a buyer or seller on our web site, LiveDeal
has no control over how your information is used or shared by that individual.
You should discuss any privacy concerns you may have with any individual you
meet through our web site, as the only protection you will have is whatever
terms you agree to directly with this individual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">On account of
the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private
communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways
not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, although we use
industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you
should not expect, that your personal information or private communications
will always remain private.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold1"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black">4. Cookies</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">LiveDeal may
set and access LiveDeal "cookies" on your computer. A cookie is a
piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.
Usage of a cookie does not link to any personally identifiable information
while on our web site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.
For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.
A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an
extended period of time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Cookies were
implemented to allow user-side customization of web site information. Cookie
related information is used by LiveDeal to facilitate the user's transactions
and to improve LiveDeal's service offering to better match the user's needs.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold1"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black">5. Log Files</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Like most
standard web site servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol
(IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit
pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends,
administer the web site, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather
broad demographic information for aggregate use. </span></p>

<p><span class="bold1"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black">6. Your Ability to Edit and Deactivate Your Account Information
and Preferences</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">You can edit
your LiveDeal account information by going to the My LiveDeal page. There, you
may also opt-out of receiving marketing or promotional-related emails. However,
we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the
LiveDeal web site, such as service announcements and administrative messages,
without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.
Occasionally, we will send you emails about new services or promotions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Upon your
request, we will deactivate your account, contact information, billing
information and any financial information from our active databases. To make
this request, email <a href="mailto:privacy@livedeal.com">privacy@livedeal.com</a>.
Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based on
your account activity and in accordance with our User Agreement and applicable
law.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">We will retain
in our files some personal information you have requested to edit or remove to
prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems,
assist with any investigations, enforce our User Agreement and comply with
legal requirements as is permitted by law. Therefore, you should not expect
that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our
databases in response to your requests. However, such personal information will
be deactivated from public and user viewing and will only be available to
select LiveDeal personnel for the limited purposes described above.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold1"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black">7. Confidentiality and Security</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Your personal
information is stored on LiveDeal's servers located in the United States. We
use physical, procedural and technical safeguards to protect that information
against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure. Certain
information is password-protected. Likewise, in certain areas, LiveDeal uses
VeriSign-certified industry-standard SSL-encryption and network firewalls to
protect data transmissions and storage. Finally, all of our employees are kept
up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold1"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black">8. Your Responsibilities</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">We go to great
lengths to protect all of your information on our web site. In order to help us
maintain the security of your personal information, we ask that you not share
your password with anybody. Sharing this information could put you and your
rating as a buyer/seller at risk. If you lose control of your password or you
think that somebody has obtained unauthorized access to your account,
immediately change your password. Please contact us if you have any questions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Please keep in
mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for
example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information
can be collected and used by others. By disclosing personal information online,
you may receive unsolicited communication from other parties in return.
Therefore, you should exercise caution and common sense in such disclosures.</span></p>

<p><span class="bold1"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black">9. Questions and Suggestions</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">We take your
privacy seriously. LiveDeal is TRUSTe-certified and a licensee. If you believe
that LiveDeal has not satisfactorily addressed any inquiries that you have
regarding privacy, please contact TRUSTe (<a href="http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog_new.php">http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog_new.php</a>),
