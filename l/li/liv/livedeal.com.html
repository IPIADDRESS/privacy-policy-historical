<p><span class="bold">Overview</span></p> 

<p>This Privacy Policy covers how LiveDeal treats the personal information that LiveDeal collects and receives, including information related to your past use of LiveDeal products and services. This privacy practice applies to our services available under the domain and sub domains of <a href="http://www.livedeal.com">www.livedeal.com</a>. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that LiveDeal does not own or control or to people that LiveDeal does not employ or manage.</p>
<p>By accepting the Privacy Policy and User Agreement when you register for a LiveDeal account, you expressly consent to our disclosure and use of your personal information in accordance with the guidelines expressed in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into LiveDeal User Agreement. We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on the web site. All amended terms that are material changes shall become effective 30 days after prominent notice is posted on the site. We will notify you of substantial changes to this Privacy Policy through our general announcement board.</p>

<p><span class="bold">1. A Special Note About Children</span></p>

<p>Children (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to use the web site unsupervised and we ask that children do not submit any personal information to us. If you are under the age of 18, you may only use the web site in conjunction with and under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who is a registered member of LiveDeal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">2. Information Collection and Use</span></p>

<p>LiveDeal is the sole owner of the information collected on <a href="http://www.livedeal.com">www.livedeal.com</a>. LiveDeal collects personal information from our users at several different points on our web site. This includes when you register with LiveDeal and when you conduct certain activities on the web site. When you register, we ask for information such as your name, email address, zip code and the College or University community near you (called Home/Sell Region). Once you register with LiveDeal and login to our services, you are not anonymous to us. However, you can browse our web site without telling us who you are or revealing personal information about yourself.</p>
<p>LiveDeal automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, LiveDeal cookies information, and the page you request.  The information collected from LiveDeal members is used to improve product offerings, customize the web site's content and layout, and for marketing and statistical effort.</p>
<p>If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address.  We will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.  We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>

<p><span class="bold">3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</span></p>

<p>Our number one priority is to keep your personal information private and confidential. We will not willfully disclose your personal information to third parties. We will not rent or sell your personal information to anyone.</p>
<p>However, certain personal information will be made available to others in the process of using our Site. This information includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Other visitors to our web site may view your member ID, feedback rating, city, region and items or messages that you have posted on our web site.</li>
<li>In order to complete the transaction, the buyer and seller will communicate through LiveDeal's messaging system.</li>
<li>Any member can view your member ID, rating, region and your city.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, once you provide personal information to a buyer or seller on our web site, LiveDeal has no control over how that information is used by that individual.  You should discuss any privacy concerns you may have with any individual you meet through our web site, as the only protection you will have is whatever terms you agree to directly with this individual.</p>
<p>Nothing in this Policy shall limit, prohibit, or otherwise deny the ability of LiveDeal to (1) transfer, assign, or sell its assets, including, without limitation, the assets of our web site, to a third party or (2) dispose of its assets in any manner through bankruptcy or similar proceeding. LiveDeal also makes no representations regarding, and disclaims all liability arising out of or related to, the accuracy or completeness of the information it collects and discloses through our Site. For more information see our "Changes to our Privacy Policy" section below.</p>
<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. LiveDeal cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as fraud, to help protect you and the LiveDeal community. In response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, address, telephone number, email address, and Member ID without a subpoena. Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to: prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity.</p>
<p>On account of the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</p>

<p><span class="bold">4. Cookies</span></p>

<p>LiveDeal may set and access LiveDeal "cookies" on your computer. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie does not link to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Cookies were implemented to allow user-side customization of Web information. Cookie related information is used by LiveDeal to facilitate the member's transactions and to improve LiveDeal's service offering to better match the member's needs.</p>

<p><span class="bold">5. Log Files</span></p>

<p>Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><span class="bold">6. Your Ability to Edit and Deactivate Your Account Information and Preferences</span></p>

<p>You can edit your LiveDeal account information by going to the My LiveDeal page. Users will soon have the ability to opt-out of marketing or promotional-related emails. LiveDeal will contact all members when this option becomes available. Until this point, we will not send such communication. We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the LiveDeal service, such as service announcements and administrative messages that are considered part of your LiveDeal account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them. Occasionally, we will send you emails about new services or promotions.</p>
<p>Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information, billing information and any financial information from our active databases. To make this request, email <a href="mailto:privacy@livedeal.com">privacy@livedeal.com</a>. Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based on your account activity and in accordance with our deactivation policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>We will retain in our files some personal information you have requested to remove to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce User Agreement and comply with legal requirements as is permitted by law. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. However, such personal information will be deactivated from public and member viewing and will only be available to select LiveDeal personnel.</p>

<p><span class="bold">7. Confidentiality and Security</span></p>

<p>LiveDeal takes every precaution to protect our members' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. Your information is stored on LiveDeal's servers located in the United States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. Your LiveDeal account information is password-protected. In certain areas, LiveDeal uses VeriSign-certified industry-standard SSL-encryption and network firewalls to protect data transmissions and storage. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.</p>

<p><span class="bold">8. Your Responsibilities</span></p>

<p>We go to great lengths to protect all of your information on our web site. In order to help us maintain the security of your personal information, we ask that you do not share your password with anybody. Sharing this information could put you and your rating as a buyer/seller at risk. If you lose control of your password or you think that somebody has obtained unauthorized access to your account, immediately change your password. Please contact us if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited communication from other parties in return. Your privacy is extremely important to LiveDeal and we do everything that we can to help you protect your personal information.</p>

<p><span class="bold">9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</span></p>

<p>LiveDeal may update this policy at any time by posting the amended terms on the web site. All amended terms that are material changes shall become effective 30 days after prominent notice is posted on the site. In addition, we may notify you in accordance with your notification preferences.</p>

<p><span class="bold">10. Questions and Suggestions</span></p>

<p>We take the matter of your privacy seriously. LiveDeal is TRUSTe-certified and a licensee. If you feel that LiveDeal has not satisfactorily addressed any inquiries that you have regarding privacy, please contact TRUSTe (<a href="http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog_new.php">http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog_new.php</a>), an independent privacy organization.
