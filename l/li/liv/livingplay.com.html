<b>LIVINGPLAY PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy ("Policy")
explains what information LivingPlay LLC and its parent company,
Future Ads LLC (referred to herein collectively as "LivingPlay",
"Company" or "we") collects from individuals who
visit the LivingPlay.com website (the "Site" or
"LivingPlay") and/or participate in the resources offered
by LivingPlay ("User(s)" or "you"). This Policy
also explains how the Company uses and maintains that information.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Changes to this Privacy Policy </b>
</p>
<p>
If we decide to change our privacy
policy, we will post those changes to this Policy, the LivingPlay
home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware
of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
circumstances, if any, we disclose it. <br><br>
</p>
<p>
We reserve the right to update or
modify this Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we
make material changes to this Policy, we will notify you here, by
email, or by means of a notice on the LivingPlay home page.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This Policy applies only to
information collected on LivingPlay and not to information collected
or obtained from other sources.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We collect two kinds of information
through the Site. The first kind is information that can identify you
as a specific individual - such as your name and email address
("PII"). We only collect PII when you have contacted us
directly or forwarded content from the Site to someone else. (See
"Collection of Personally Identifiable Information" below).
The second kind of information is the kind of non-personally
identifiable information ("NPII") collected and stored
automatically by many websites. It includes, for example, information
about your Internet service provider, operating system, type of
browser, geographic location, and pages viewed on the Site. Although
this information is related to you, it is not associated with your
PII and cannot be linked to you personally.  If you register to <a href="http://livingplay.com/ClientPrivacyPolicy.lp">play</a>
"Premium Games", the NPII collected may also include your
IP address and HTML information about the content of web pages you
visit.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If you do not want your information to
<a href="http://livingplay.com/ClientPrivacyPolicy.lp">continue</a>
to be collected and used as provided in this Policy, you should not
access or use the Site again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Premium Game players ("Premium
User(s)") have access to the Premium Games at no charge in
exchange for their agreement to install the LivingPlay software (the
"Software") on their computers or other computing device.
The Software allows us to provide a Premium User with a limited
amount of in-text and
pop-up/under advertisements
based on the web content viewed by that Premium User. No PII is
collected through the Software.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Collection of Personally
Identifiable Information </b>
</p>
<p>
PII is collected by LivingPlay only
when you provide it to us by using one of the following Site
features:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>
	When you <a href="http://livingplay.com/ClientPrivacyPolicy.lp">communicate</a>
	with us via the "Contact Us" page, LivingPlay asks for
	your name, phone number and email address so that you can receive a
	response.
	</p>
	</li><li><p>
	When you use our "Send Game to
	Friend" feature, LivingPlay collects the name and email address
	of you and your friend. We will only send your friend a onetime
	email inviting them to visit the site and check out the game that
	you sent them. We do not retain their PII for any purpose.
	</p>
</li></ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>AdThis Widget</b>

</p>
<p>
If you choose to use our referral
service to send a game to a friend using the AdThis Widget, AdThis
will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We do not
collect or store the information collected through the AdThis widget,
please read their privacy policy regarding the collection and use of
information. We also use the AdThis widget in order to allow you to
share links to the Site on various third party web sites. Please note
that you will be taken to these third party domains and asked to
login to your account in order to share links about LivingPlay.
LivingPlay does not have any access to this information.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If you do not want us to collect your
PII as described above or to use and share your PII as described
further below in this Policy, you should NOT provide it to us through
any of the LivingPlay features described above. By providing us with
your PII using any of these features, you are authorizing our use and
sharing of your PII as described in this Policy and any subsequent
revisions to this Policy that we may publish on the Site.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Updating Your Personally
Identifiable Information. </b>
</p>

If your PII changes, or if you no
longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, or remove
it by emailing our Customer Support at

<b>Children's Privacy</b>

</p>
<p>
LivingPlay and the content available
or emails delivered in connection with LivingPlay, are neither
intended for, nor directed to, nor to be accessed by, persons under
the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under 13
years of age.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Use and Sharing of Personally
Identifiable Information</b></p>
<p>
We reserve the right to use PII: (1)
for the specific purpose for which such information was provided as
stated above; (2) for the purposes disclosed at the time such
information is provided; or (3) as disclosed in this Policy. We may
also retain outside contractors to provide technical support or
perform other services for us. We require that these contractors keep
the PII of our Users confidential and that they use personal
information only on behalf of the Company.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In addition, if we go through a
business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another
company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your PII will
likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified by a
prominent notice on the LivingPlay home page of any such change in
ownership or control of your PII.  We also reserve the right to
disclose PII as required by law and when we believe that disclosure
is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial
proceeding, court order, or legal process.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Non-Personally Identifiable
Information </b>
</p>
<p>
As with many websites, when you visit
LivingPlay, LivingPlay automatically gathers certain NPII based on
your computer information and stores it in log files. This type of
technical and statistical information is used to customize your
experience at LivingPlay, to help us improve the quality of
LivingPlay and to make your visits to LivingPlay easy, convenient and
fun. LivingPlay also collects your IP address to help diagnose
problems with the Site server and for Site administration purposes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In addition to the general collection
of NPII by the Site, the Software downloaded by Premium Users tracks
URLs, HTML, web pages and/or
search queries on the web pages
visited in order to deliver ads
in the form of in-text and pop-up/under advertisements which appear
when online generally.   An average of four ads per day will be shown
based on the web content viewed.  If
at any time, a Premium User no longer wants the Software to collect
NPII or to deliver customized advertising, s/he may deactivate the
Software which will uninstall the Software and its associated
monitoring technologies. The directions for uninstalling the Software
are set forth below in the section entitled "Deactivate
Software."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Cookies</b></p>
<p>
LivingPlay uses "cookies"
and similar means to collect aggregate Internet traffic statistics
and to enhance your experience at the Site. A cookie is a small text
file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies
contain information that can later be read by a web server in the
domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run
programs or deliver viruses to your computer. LivingPlay uses cookies
to recognize your preferences, temporarily store session information
(such as your login to a download or support area), and to remember
you when you register for our products and/or services. This helps
save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same
information and to display your customized content and advertising on
your later visits to the Site. It also allows you to move from page
to page at the Site without having to sign in again on each page. If
you do not want LivingPlay to deploy cookies in your browser, you can
set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website
tries to put a cookie in your browser software. If you choose to
decline cookies, however, you may not be able to fully experience the
interactive features of the Site and it may affect your ability to
use some of the products and/or services at the Site. We do not tie
any PII to the cookies that we set.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Third Party Cookies</b></p>
<p>
The use of cookies by our third party
advertisers as well as third party ad servers is not covered by our
privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.
These third parties use session ID cookies to gather anonymous
information.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Web Beacons</b></p>
<p>
The Site may contain electronic images
known as "web beacons" which are also sometimes called
single-pixel gifs. Web beacons may be used to assist in delivering
cookies, allow us to count users who have visited the Site pages and
to deliver services via the Site. We may also include web beacons in
email messages or newsletters you agree to receive in order to
determine whether such messages have been opened and acted upon. If
any partner advertises on our website, we may work with them to place
web beacons on their website to allow LivingPlay to collect
statistics on how often clicking on those advertisements on our
website results in a purchase or other action on such partner's
website. LivingPlay may also employ web beacons from third party
partners in order to help compile aggregated statistics regarding the
effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations of the
Site. LivingPlay will never allow web beacons on the Site to be used
by third parties to collect or access your personal information. We
do not tie web beacons to any PII you submit while on our Site.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Use and Sharing of Non-Personally
Identifiable Information (NPII)</b>

</p>
<p>
We share NPII with our business
partners in order to customize the services they and LivingPlay
provide to you. And of course, we may also disclose any of the NPII
collected through LivingPlay or the Software in order to (1) comply
with applicable laws, (2) respond to governmental inquiries, (3)
comply with valid legal process, or (4) protect our rights and
property or that of or our Users.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Security</b></p>
<p>
We have implemented technical,
administrative and physical security measures to protect Information
from unauthorized access and improper use. We keep information on
servers that are protected by firewalls and located in a physically
secure facility accessible only to authorized employees. From time to
time, we review our security procedures in order to consider
appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though, that,
despite our reasonable efforts, no security measures are impenetrable
and any connection to LivingPlay or information transmitted to us or
to LivingPlay will be at your own risk.
</p>

</p>
<p>

usually found on these companies' websites or within each of their
email communications.
