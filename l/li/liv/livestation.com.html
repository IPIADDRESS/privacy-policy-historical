            	<p>
            	We may also pass on your login information to a channel provider or platform operator in the case of subscription channels or premium programming to enable you to view such channels or programmes.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	We may also store and transfer a small file known as a 'cookie' to save and maintain information and preferences while you are using the Livestation software or Website and between sessions.

            	<h2>Sharing Personal Information</h2>
            	<p>
            	Livestation may share your personal information with third parties we use to perform certain services for us such as support or technical functions. We will limit the information we share and these third parties are required to use the personal information we share with them only to perform services on our behalf and to treat your personal information as strictly confidential. 
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	Livestation may also share your personal information with other Livestation businesses or with third parties who partner with us to provide products and services to our customers.

            	</p>
            	<p>
            	In certain limited circumstances we may share or transfer personal information to unrelated third parties. This may be at your request, to comply with a legal requirement or court order, to investigate a possible crime, or a matter on which we require legal advice or under similar circumstances. In such cases we will take appropriate steps to protect your personal information. 
            	</p>
            	</li>

            	<p>
            	Livestation will maintain reasonable safeguards to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of your personal information. For example, we use encryption to protect any passwords and we restrict access to information both physically and logically. Although we use security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorised disclosure, misuse or alteration, as is the case with all public computer networks, we cannot guarantee the security of information provided over the Internet and will not be responsible for breaches of security beyond our reasonable control.

            	</li>
            	<li>
            	<h2>Links to third-party services</h2>
            	<p>
            	The Livestation Software and our Website may contain references or links to third-party services that are not operated by Livestation. These references or links are provided as a service and do not imply any endorsement of the activities or content of such services or any association with their operators.
