<p>Welcome to LiveMocha.com (“Site”), an online service
designed to provide language learning content, language learning curriculum,
and to facilitate language exchanges and foreign language practice.&nbsp;
LiveMocha.com is owned and operated by LiveMocha, Inc.&nbsp; LIVEMOCHA, INC is
committed to safeguarding your privacy, and this privacy policy explains our
data collection, use, and disclosure practices.&nbsp; If you have specific questions
about these practices, please contact us by email at postmaster@LiveMocha.com.</p>

<h2>1. Information Collected&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </h2>

<p>When you register with LiveMocha.com, you provide us with
certain personal information, such as your name, your email address, your
spoken and learning languages, your gender, and any other personal or
preference information that you provide to us.&nbsp; </p>

<p>When you use LiveMocha.com, you may set up your personal
profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries,
enroll in events and courses, and transmit information through various
channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service
and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for
instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see
your friend list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of
the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the
prior version of that information.</p>

<p>You can choose not to provide this information to us, but in
general some information about you is required in order for you to register and
participate in the features offered through the Site.</p>

<p>If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend
about our site, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically
send your friend an email inviting him or her to visit the site. LiveMocha.com
may attempt to send invitations more than once. LiveMocha.com stores this
information to send email, to register a friend connection if your invitation
is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may
contact us at postmaster@livemocha.com to request that we remove this
information from our database.</p>

<p>We automatically collect some information about your
computer when you visit the Site.&nbsp; For example, we will collect your IP
address, Web browser software (such as Netscape Navigator or Internet
Explorer), and referring web site.&nbsp; We also may collect information about your
activity on this Site, such as the courses in which you enroll.&nbsp; One of our
goals in collecting this automatic information is to help improve your user
experience.</p>

<p>Finally, when you visit the Site, we may assign your
computer a "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file) to
remember who you are.&nbsp; For example, if you register on the Site, we may record
your username in a cookie for verification purposes.&nbsp; We also may include other
information in our cookie files; for example, if you arrived at our Site via a
link from third party site, we may include the URL of the linking page.</p>

<p>Please note that, at this time, the Site is not designed for
children under 13 years old.&nbsp; Accordingly, LIVEMOCHA, INC will not knowingly
collect or maintain personal information from children under 13 through the
Site.</p>

<h2>2. Use of Personal Information</h2>

<p>We will use personal information about you for the following
general purposes:&nbsp; to provide you with the products and services you request;
to respond to your questions and comments; to communicate with you via regular
mail and email (or other electronic means) about our programs and services; to
measure interest in and improve our services and Site; to solicit information
from you, including through surveys; to resolve disputes, collect fees, or
troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially illegal activities; to enforce
our Terms of Use; and otherwise as described to you at the point of
collection.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Please review “Your choices with respect to the Collection
and Use of Personal Information” below.</p>

<h2>3. Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>

address and password) to people browsing for friends, and to support other Site

vendors who provide services or functions on our behalf, including customer

information for any other purpose.</p>

<p>(b)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To business partners

<p>(e)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In connection with a

contain any personal information and is most often used to develop content and
services that we hope you find of interest.</p>



<h2>4. A Special Word About Chat Rooms and Email</h2>

<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose
personal information online, that information can be collected and used by
others.&nbsp; By posting personal information online that is publicly accessible,
you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</p>



<h2>5. Access To Personal Information</h2>

<p>You may obtain a copy of any personal information about you
that you provide through the Site or otherwise request that LIVEMOCHA, INC
update or make changes to such personal information by sending an email to

particular communication or by contacting us at postmaster@LiveMocha.com.</p>

the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from
accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a
new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.</p>



<h2>7. Security</h2>

<p>While no web site can guarantee security, LIVEMOCHA, INC has
implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security
procedures to help protect personal information.&nbsp; For example, only authorized
employees are permitted to access personal information, and they only may do so
for permitted business functions.</p>



<h2>8. Children Under 13</h2>

<p>As noted above, the Site is not intended for use by
children.&nbsp; Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information
to us, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to
inform him or her that the Site is not intended for children under the age of
13 and we will delete that information from our records.&nbsp; If you believe that
we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us
at postmaster@livemocha.com</p>



<h2>9. Third Party Websites</h2>

<p>Web sites to which this Site links do not operate under this
Privacy Policy.&nbsp; We recommend that you examine the privacy statements posted on
those other web sites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and
disclosing personal information. </p>

<h2>10. Third Party Advertising</h2>

<p><span>Advertisements
that appear on LiveMocha.com are sometimes delivered (or "served")
directly to users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your
IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download
cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and
"web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the
effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this
allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send
you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to
personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information
about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements
and determine which advertisements are clicked. LiveMocha.com does not have
access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party
advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information
stored on LiveMocha.com unless you choose to share it with them. </span></p>

<p><span>This privacy
policy covers the use of cookies by LiveMocha.com and does not cover the use of
cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.</span></p>

material changes to this Privacy Policy by sending a notice to the e-mail
address you provided to us or by placing a prominent notice on the Site. </p>
