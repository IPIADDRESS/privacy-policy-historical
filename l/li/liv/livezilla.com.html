    The author is not responsible for any contents linked or referred to from his pages - unless he has full knowledge of illegal contents and would be able to
    prevent the visitors of his site fromviewing those pages. If any damage occurs by the use of information presented there, only the author of the respective

    <br><br>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Use of YouTube components with enhanced data protection mode</h2>
    <br><br>


    On our website we use components (videos) of YouTube, LLC 901 Cherry Ave., 94066 San Bruno, CA, USA, a company belonging to Google Inc., Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
    To this end, we use the - enhanced data protection mode - option provided by YouTube.
    When you display a page that has an embedded video, a connection will be made to the YouTube server and the content will appear on the website via a
    communication to your browser.
    According to the information provided by YouTube, in - enhanced data protection mode -, data is only transferred to the YouTube server, in particular
    which of our websites you have visited, if you watch the video. If you are logged onto YouTube at the same time, this information will be matched to your
    YouTube member account. You can prevent this from happening by logging out of your member account before visiting our website.
    <br><br>
    Further information about data protection by YouTube is provided by Google under the following link:
    <br><br>
    https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/

    <br><br>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Use of Google Analytics with anonymization function</h2>
    <br><br>
    We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereafter "Google". Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer and thereby allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated by these cookies, such as the time, location and frequency of your website visit, including your IP address, is transmitted to Google in the United States and stored there. We use Google Analytics on our website with an IP anonymization feature. In this case, your IP address will already be shortened and thus anonymised by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of our site, to compile reports on our website activity, and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties if required by law or as far as third parties process this data on behalf of Google. Google does not claim to link your IP address to any other data provided by Google. You can prevent the installation of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; however, we point out that in this case you may not be able to fully use all functions of our website. In addition, Google offers a deactivation option for the most popular browsers, giving you more control over what data Google collects and processes. If you enable this option, website visit information will not be sent to Google Analytics. Activation does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or any other web analytics services we may use. For more information about Google's opt-out option and to enable this option, please visit the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en

    <br><br>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Use of Google Adwords</h2>
    <br><br>
    We also use the Google advertising tool "Google Adwords" to promote our website. As part of this, we use the "Conversion Tracking" analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, "Google", on our website. If you have reached our website via a Google ad, a cookie will be stored on your computer. Cookies are small text files that your Internet browser stores and saves on your computer. These so-called "conversion cookies" lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for your personal identification. If you visit certain pages on our website and the cookie has not expired yet, we and Google may recognize that you, as a user, clicked on one of our Google ads and were redirected to our site.
    The information obtained through the "Conversion Cookies" is used by Google to create visitor statistics for our website. These statistics tell us the total number of users who clicked on our ad, and which pages on our site were subsequently accessed by their respective users. However, we or other advertisers do not receive any information through "Google Adwords" that personally identifies users.
    You can prevent the installation of the "conversion cookies" by setting your browser accordingly, for example by setting a browser that generally deactivates the automatic setting of cookies or specifically blocks only cookies from the domain "googleadservices.com".
    Google's privacy policy can be found at the following link: https://services.google.com/sitestats/en.html

    <br><br>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Use of Google Remarketing</h2>
    <br><br>
    We use the Google Remarketing service of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter "Google", on our website. Google Remarketing can show ads to people who have already visited our website in the past. Within the Google ad network, advertisements tailored to their interests can be displayed on our site. Google Remarketing uses cookies for this evaluation. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and allow an analysis of the use of the website. This will allow us to recognize our visitors as soon as they visit websites within Google's advertising network. In this way, within the Google ad network, advertisements may be presented that relate to content that the visitor previously viewed on Google Network websites that also use Google's remarketing feature. Google does not collect any personal data. You can disable this feature if you make the appropriate settings at http://www.google.com/settings/ads.

    <br><br>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Use of Facebook Remarketing</h2>
    <br><br>
    This website uses the remarketing feature "Custom Audiences" of Facebook Inc. ("Facebook"). This function serves to present to visitors of this website, as part of their visit to the social network Facebook, interest-based advertisements ("Facebook Ads"). For this purpose, the Facebook remarketing tag was implemented on this website. Through this tag, a direct connection to the Facebook servers is made when visiting the website. It is transmitted to the Facebook server that you have visited this website and Facebook assigns this information to your personal Facebook user account. For more information on the collection and use of data by Facebook, as well as your rights in this regard and ways to protect your privacy, please refer to the privacy policy of Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. Alternatively, you can disable the remarketing feature "Custom Audiences" at https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads#_=_. For this you must be logged in to Facebook.


    <br><br>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Use of LiveZilla</h2>
    <br><br>

    On our site, we use components of LiveZilla GmbH, Ekkehardstrasse 10, 78224 Singen. These components collect and store data from every single visit to the
    site for the purposes of web analysis and the operation of a live chat system. This data can then be used to generate pseudonymised user profiles via the
    deployment of cookies. These user profiles can assist with the analysis of visitor behaviour and of the operation of the live chat system and may be evaluated
    in order to improve our Internet provision and to enable us to design our site in a way that meets user needs.



    <br><br>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Information/Cancellation/Deletion</h2>
    <br><br>

    On the basis of the Federal Data Protection Act, you may contact us at no cost if you have questions relating to the collection, processing or use of your
    personal information, if you wish to request the correction, blocking or deletion of the same, or if you wish to cancel explicitly granted consent.
    Please note that you have the right to have incorrect data corrected or to have personal data deleted, where such claim is not barred by any legal
    obligation to retain this data.
