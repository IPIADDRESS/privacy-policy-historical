    <p>Your right to privacy is very important. Livedrive recognise that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner.

    <h2>Information Disclosure Policy</h2><br>
    <p><strong>Personal and account information</strong><br>
    Livedrive will not otherwise disclose its customers' personal and account information unless Livedrive has reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of Livedrive, Livedrive' customers, or others, or where Livedrive has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure.</p><br>
    
    <p><strong>Electronic communications</strong><br>
    Livedrive also will not, except for reasons stated below, disclose to third parties the contents of any electronic mail or other electronic communications that Livedrive stores or transmits for its customers.
