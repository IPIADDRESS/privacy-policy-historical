procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information. Users can
access the Livedrive service (the "Service") through our website
www.livedrive.com, applications on Devices, through APIs, and through
third-parties. A <strong>"Device"</strong> is any computer used to
access the Livedrive Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop,
mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy
governs your access to the Livedrive Service, regardless of how you access it,
and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing,
storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the
different forms of data, content, and information described below are
collectively referred to as "information".</p><p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:18.0pt;

Information We Collect And Store</strong></p><p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">We may collect and store the
following information when running the Livedrive Service:<br>
<br>
<strong>Information You Provide:</strong> When you register an account, we
collect some personal information, such as your name, phone number, credit card
or other billing information, email address and home and business postal
addresses. You may also ask us to import your contacts by giving us access to
your third party services (for example, your email account) or to use your
social networking information if you give us access to your account on social
network connection services. You may also provide us with your contacts' email
addresses when sharing folders or files with them.<br>
<br>
<strong>Files:</strong> We collect and store the files you upload, download, or
access with the Livedrive Service (<strong>"Files"</strong>). If you
add a file to your Livedrive that has been previously uploaded by you or
another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous file with your
account rather than storing a duplicate.<br>
<br>
<strong>Log Data:</strong> When you use the Service, we automatically record
information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the
Services. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol ("IP")
address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website,
information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification
numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps
associated with transactions, system configuration information, physical system
information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the
Service.<br>
<br>
<strong>Cookies:</strong> We also use "cookies" to collect
information and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we
transfer to your Device. We may use "persistent cookies" to save your
registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use
“session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better
understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and
web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing
its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a
cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you
may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.</p><p style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:

We Use Personal Information</strong><u><span style="color:blue"></span></u></p><p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><strong>Personal Information:</strong> In the
course of using the Service, we may collect personal information that can be
used to contact or identify you (<strong>"Personal Information"</strong>).
Personal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Service,
(ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand your
needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v)
to provide or offer software updates and product announcements.<br>
<br>
<strong>Geo-Location Information:</strong> Some Devices allow applications to
access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Our mobile apps
do not collect such information as of the date this policy went into effect,
but may do so in the future with your consent to improve our Services. Some
photos you place in Livedrive may contain recorded location information. We may
use this information to optimize your experience. Also, some of the information
we collect from a Device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to
approximate a Device’s location.<br>
<br>
<strong>Analytics:</strong> We also collect some information (ourselves or
using third party services) using logging and cookies, which can sometimes be
correlated with Personal Information. We use this information for the above
purposes and to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service’s
technical administration, to increase our Service’s functionality and
user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for the
Service to process their requests. As of the date this policy went into effect,
we use Google Analytics. To learn more about the privacy policy of Google
Analytics, <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html">click here</a>,

Sharing and Disclosure</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><strong>Your Use:</strong> We will display your
Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Service
according to the preferences you set in your account. Any information you
choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you.
Please consider carefully what information you disclose in your profile page
and your desired level of anonymity. You can review and revise your profile
information at any time. We may also share or disclose your information with your
consent, for example if you use a third party application to access your
account (see below). Through certain features of the Service, you may also have
the ability to make some of your information public. Public information may be
broadly and quickly disseminated.<br>
<br>
<strong>Service Providers, Business Partners and Others:</strong> We may use
certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help us provide,
analyze, and improve the Service (including but not limited to data storage,
maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing,
and improvement of the Service’s features). These third parties may have access
to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf
and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Transfer of Personal Data:</strong> Should we transfer your personal
data from Livedrive Internet Limited to j2 Cloud Services, Inc. (for example,
in the context of the processing of your billing information), we will do so in
a lawful manner through the use of Model Contracts for the transfer of personal
data to third countries, as detailed by the European Commission.<br>
<br>
<strong>Third-Party Applications:</strong> We may share your information with a
third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to
access our Services through such an application. We are not responsible for
what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust
the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you.<br>
<br>
<strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of
Livedrive's Rights:</strong> We may disclose to parties outside Livedrive files
stored in your Livedrive and information about you that we collect when we have
a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with
a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any
person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of
Livedrive or its users; or (d) to protect Livedrive’s property rights. If we
provide your Livedrive files to a law enforcement agency as set forth above, we
will remove Livedrive’s encryption from the files before providing them to law
enforcement. However, Livedrive will not be able to decrypt any files that you
encrypted prior to storing them on Livedrive.<br>
<br>
<strong>Non-private or Non-Personal Information:</strong> We may disclose your
non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage
statistics of our Service.</p><p style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:

If you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct or delete the
Personal Information provided in your registration or account profile by
changing your "account settings". If your personally identifiable
information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or
delete it by making the change on your account settings. In some cases we may

Retention</strong><br>
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as
needed to provide you services. We may retain and use your information as
necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce
our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your
information quickly upon request. Please note, however, that there might be
latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might
exist after deletion. In addition, we do not delete from our servers files that
you have in common with other users.</p><p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:

Our Service offers publicly accessible community services such as blogs,

these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Your

</span></b><strong>Security</strong><br>
The security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive
information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the
transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We
follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us,
both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of electronic
transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee
its absolute security.&nbsp;</p>
