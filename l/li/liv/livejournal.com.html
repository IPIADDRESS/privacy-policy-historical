        <!-- Content -->
        

<p>Information you share with us is used for LiveJournal's internal business
purposes. LiveJournal is not in the business of selling information about you.
This notice tells you what information we collect, steps we take to protect
and secure it, how we use and share the information, and finally, how you can
access that information or contact us with questions or concerns.</p>

<h2>Information We Gather</h2>

<ul>

<li> LiveJournal collects personal information that you provide when you
register with us, use LiveJournal products or services available on the
LiveJournal Site (the "Service") or post content on a LiveJournal Blog site as
a guest with authoring rights. </li>

<li> LiveJournal may also collect personal information you provide to us when
you enter any promotions or sweepstakes offered on the LiveJournal site. </li>

<li> LiveJournal may aggregate your information with information from other
users (without personally identifying you) and share it with our business
partners or others. </li>

<li> LiveJournal may also collect information about your transactions with us
and with some of our business partners. This information might include
information necessary to process payments due to us from you such as your
credit card number. </li>

<li> LiveJournal automatically receives and records information on our server
logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookies, and the pages you
request. </li>

</ul>

<h2>How we use IP Address Information</h2>

<ul>

<li> LiveJournal may occasionally obtain IP addresses from users depending
upon how you access our web site. IP addresses, browser and session
information may be used for various purposes, including to:</li>

<ul>

<li> Diagnose and prevent service or technology problems reported by our
users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by
a specific web company or ISP. </li>

<li> Estimate the total number of users visiting LiveJournal from
specific geographical regions. </li>

<li> Help determine which users have access privileges to certain content,
services or resources that we offer. </li>

<li> Monitor and prevent fraud and abuse. </li>

<li> Deliver more relevant advertisements to you. </li>

</ul>

<li> LiveJournal may display your IP address to the owners or
maintainers of certain LiveJournal journals when you post to those journals
and the owner or maintainer has enabled functionality on the site for this
purpose. </li>

</ul>

<h2>How we use Cookies</h2>

<ul>

<li> A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous
unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers
and stored on your computer's hard drive.</li>

<li> You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies,
or notify you when a cookie is set, however, if you configure your browser to
reject cookies, you may not be able to use LiveJournal products or services
that require you to "sign in" and you may not be able to take full advantage
of all offerings on the LiveJournal site.</li>

<li> LiveJournal uses its own cookies for a number of purposes,
including to:</li>

<ul>

<li>Require you to re-enter your LiveJournal password after a certain period
of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your
account contents.</li>

<li>Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using
LiveJournal's services.</li>

<li>Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.</li>

<li>Conduct research to improve LiveJournal's content and services.</li>

</ul>

<li> LiveJournal lets other entities that show advertisements on some of our web pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other entities' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, and not this policy. Advertisers or other entities do not have access to LiveJournal's cookies.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Special Rules Information Relating to Children</h2>

<ul>

<li>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we
inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose
personal information from children under 13 years of age.  LiveJournal
is not directed at children under 13 years of age but, we recognize that
with proper adult supervision some parents might permit their children to
visit LiveJournal and use our Service.  COPPA requires that we obtain
the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years
of age to use certain features of LiveJournal.</li>

<li>When your child attempts to register and/or provide personal
information to LiveJournal, we require a parent or legal guardian
to:</li>

<ol>

<li>complete the registration;</li>

<li>review our privacy policy and to submit a valid credit card number to
verify that the child's parent or guardian knows about and authorizes our
information practices related to children protected by COPPA; and</li>

<li>verify through the use of an email confirmation and second
authorization that the parent or guardian consents to the Terms of Service
and this privacy policy.</li>

</ol>

<li>Once parental notice and consent has been verified, the information we
collect will be treated the same as information collected from any other
user of LiveJournal.  Without verified parental notice and consent,
we will not knowingly collect personal information relating to children under
13 years of age, and if we learn that we have inadvertently collected such
information, we will promptly delete it.</li>

</ul>

<h2>How Parents can Access their Children's Personal Information</h2>

<p>In compliance with COPPA, a parent or legal guardian may request from us
to review, delete or stop the collection of personally identifiable
information relating to their child or any child in their legal custody who is
under 13 years of age. You may do so in one of two ways.</p>

<p>If you know the user name and password, follow the instructions below
regarding <em>Changing your Preferences and Personal Information</em>, or
you may contact us by letter, phone or email using the address information
provided at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>If you request that no further information about your child be collected
or used, we will be required to terminate your child's ability to use any part
of the Service that requires a user to "sign in."</p>

<h2>How we Use, Share and Disclose Information We Collect</h2>

<ul>

<li>LiveJournal does not share personal information we learn about
you from your use of the Service or this web site with others except as
described in this policy.  We do not share your information with unrelated
third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</li>

<li>When you provide personal information through using the Service you
are however sharing your personal information with LiveJournal,
organizations that may hold a majority interest in LiveJournal, their
divisions or subsidiaries and, LiveJournal and any of its divisions or
subsidiaries.  The use of your personal information by these organizations
is subject to this policy.</li>

<li>We do not share your information with unrelated third parties for their
direct marketing purposes. However, LiveJournal may display targeted
advertisements based on personally non-identifiable information (such as
browser type and IP address) and/or personal selection (See the Section
entitled "Third Party Advertising" below for more information on how your
information is shared with advertisers).</li>

<li>LiveJournal may use your personal information where it is necessary for us
to complete a transaction, to operate or improve LiveJournal and related
products and services, to do something that you have asked us to do, or tell
you of products and services that we think may be of interest.</li>

<li>LiveJournal may use your email address to contact you with required email
messages about the Service.</li>

<li>Where you are contacted with an offer or service based on information
you have shared with LiveJournal, we will do our best to provide you
with an opportunity to opt-out of receiving such further communications at
the time you are contacted. </li>

<li>When you post a message, your LiveJournal ID or alias that you are
posting under may be visible to other users. </li>

<li>When you post a message on LiveJournal Blog Sites, you have the ability to
post a message which may include personally identifiable information about
yourself; consequently, you should understand that if you post personal
information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive
unsolicited messages from other parties in return, and we cannot be
responsible for the use of any information you post publicly. </li>

<li>LiveJournal does or may share personally identifiable information
about you under the following circumstances:</li>

<ul>

<li>In the course of operating our business it may be necessary or
appropriate for us to provide access to your personal information to
others such as our service providers, contractors and select vendors so
that we can operate the Service and our business.  Where practical, we
seek to obtain confidentiality agreements that are consistent with this
policy and that limit others' use or disclosure of the information you have
shared.</li>

<li>We may transfer personal information to certain advertising partners that
you have explicitly requested to receive information from.  It will be clear
at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and
whose privacy statement will apply.</li>

<li>We may share your personal information to respond to subpoenas, court
orders, or legal process, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend
against legal claims, if in our judgment, disclosure is required or
appropriate in such circumstances.</li>

<li>We may share your personal information if we believe it is necessary in
order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,
suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical
safety of any person, violations of LiveJournal's terms of use, or as
otherwise required by law.</li>

<li>As we continue to develop our business, we might also sell all or part of
our business. In such transactions, personally identifiable information you
have shared with us is generally one of the business assets that may be
transferred. The transferred personally identifiable information will remain
subject to the promises made in this privacy policy or subsequent policies to
which you have consented.</li>

</ul>

</ul>

<p>If there is ever a change to how LiveJournal uses or intends to use
personal information, we will post that change to this policy and, if the
new policy is materially less restrictive than this policy, we will seek
your consent.</p>

<h2>Third Party Advertising</h2>

<p>Advertisements appearing on LiveJournal may be delivered to users by
LiveJournal or one of our advertising partners.  Our advertising partners may
set cookies.  These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer
each time they send you an online advertisement.  In this way, advertising
partners (or "ad networks") may compile information about where you, or others
who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads
are clicked on.  This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted
advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.  This
privacy policy covers the use of cookies by LiveJournal and does not cover the
use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<p>LiveJournal does not share any personally identifiable information with
advertisers.  LiveJournal may share general demographic information (such as
information about members' aggregate interests and occupations) and
non-personally identifiable information (such as browser type and IP
addresses) with advertisers and partners.  If you have a Plus account or
are a Basic or Early Adopter account viewing a Plus account's journal or
other content, LiveJournal shares your voluntarily-provided public profile
information (such as sex, age, location and interests) and your
voluntarily-provided advertising preferences information with advertisers.
LiveJournal does not give advertisers access to your private personal account
information (such as email address, or, if you have elected to make these
private or friends-only in your profile, sex and location). However, by
selecting, interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the
possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the
targeting criteria used to display the ad.</p>

<h2>Confidentiality and Security</h2>

<p>No data transmissions over the Internet or via wireless networks can be
guaranteed to be 100%
secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we
receive your transmission, we make efforts to ensure security on our
systems.</p>

<ul>

<li>We use physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect
personal information about you.</li>

<li>Your LiveJournal Account Information is password-protected.</li>

<li>In certain areas, LiveJournal uses industry-standard SSL-encryption
to protect data transmissions. However, please note that this is not a
guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or
destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.</li>

</ul>

<p>If LiveJournal learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to
notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps,
however, we will never ask you to submit additional personal information or to
verify the status of or information related to your account in any electronic
communication email. By using this web site or providing personal information
to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding
security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this site.
LiveJournal may post a notice on our web site if a security breach occurs. If
this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the
LiveJournal.com web site. LiveJournal may also send an email to you at the
email address you have provided to us in these circumstances, however, we will
never ask you to submit additional personal information or to verify the
status of or information related to your account in any such email. Depending
on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security
breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to
withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us
at <a href="mailto:privacy@livejournal.com">privacy@livejournal.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Changing your Preferences and Personal Information</h2>

<ul>

<li>You can edit your LiveJournal Account Information at any time.
Most personal information you may provide is entirely optional.  For
example, to the extent that parents are considering whether to permit their
children to use the Service, we do not condition a child's participation
based upon their provision of any more personal information than is
necessary to operate the Service.</li>

<li>You can delete your LiveJournal account by visiting our Account
Deletion page; however, please note that some personal information,
primarily your contact information, may remain in LiveJournal's records
to the extent necessary to protect LiveJournal's legal interests or
document compliance with regulatory requirements.</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="contact"></a>Contacting LiveJournal</h2>

<p>If you have a privacy concern regarding LiveJournal, or this
policy, and if you cannot satisfactorily resolve it through the
use of this web site, you should then write to us by email to <a href="mailto:privacy@livejournal.com">privacy@livejournal.com</a>.</p>

<p>If you object to any sharing of your personal information that may be
permitted under this policy, you may do so by writing us at the above address.
We will take reasonable steps to accommodate your requests as they relate to
our advertising practices. In some instances, honoring your requests may
interfere with or preclude your ability to use the Service or may require us
to terminate our relationship with you.</p>
