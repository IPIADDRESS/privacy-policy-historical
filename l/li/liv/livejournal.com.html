personal information from children under 13 years of age.  LiveJournal.com
is not directed at children under 13 years of age but, we recognize that
with proper adult supervision some parents might permit their children to
visit LiveJournal.com and use our Service.  COPPA requires that we obtain
the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years
of age to use certain features of LiveJournal.com.</li>

information to LiveJournal.com, we require a parent or legal guardian
to:</li>

<ol>

<li>complete the registration;</li>

<li>review our privacy policy and to submit a valid credit card number to
verify that the child's parent or guardian knows about and authorizes our
information practices related to children protected by COPPA; and</li>

<li>verify through the use of an email confirmation and second
authorization that the parent or guardian consents to the Terms of Service
and this privacy policy.</li>

</ol>

<li>Once parental notice and consent has been verified, the information we
collect will be treated the same as information collected from any other
user of LiveJournal.com.  Without verified parental notice and consent,
we will not knowingly collect personal information of children under 13
years of age, and if we learn that we have inadvertently collected such
information, we will promptly delete it.</li>

</ul>

us to review, delete or stop the collection of the personally identifiable
information of their child. You may do so in one of two ways.</p>

regarding <em>Changing your Preferences and Personal Information</em>, or
you may contact us by letter, phone or email using the address information
provided at the bottom of this page.</p>
