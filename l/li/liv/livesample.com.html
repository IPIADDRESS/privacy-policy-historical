 <p><strong>SAFETY AND SECURITY</strong></p>
 <p>LiveSample is committed to protecting the security and integrity of information collected from you. We take strict security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of Personal Information. These measures include internal review of our data collection, storage and processing practices. We also take physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. Our policy is to allow only authorized personnel to access the physical areas where such systems are located. In addition, we use firewalls to protect the servers from outside intrusion. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
 <p><strong>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</strong></p>
 <p>LiveSample strongly believes that it is important to protect the privacy of children and we encourage parents or guardians to spend time with their children to participate and monitor their Internet activities. Accordingly, LiveSample complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and all other applicable laws and regulations concerning children and the Internet. Our surveys are not directed to children under the age of 13, therefore we do not provide memberships to persons under age 13. We will not knowingly collect, maintain, or disclose any personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>
 <p>From time to time, we may ask our adult survey respondents whether they have children residing with them who might have certain interests, such as favorite movies or music. In such event, we do not ask the child or parent to submit personally identifiable information about the child.</p>
 <p><strong>USE OF COOKIES / FLASH COOKIES</strong></p>
 <p>LiveSample uses "Cookies" and local shared objects ("Flash Cookies") to provide a better experience to you when participating in surveys. Cookies are bits of electronic information stored on your hard drive and are often used to save website customizations and website login information (such as email address and password). Cookies are used temporarily during the time you are actively completing a survey or filling out the registration forms. When we use cookies, we do so to help us recognize you as a prior user of this site. This improves the delivery of web pages the next time you visit the site and allows us to provide you with information specifically tailored to your interests. We do not store or retain information collected by a cookie and you always have the option to delete cookies from your computer. However this will reduce your chances of receiving more tailored surveys and as a result lower your reward earning opportunities.</p>
 <p>The use of third party cookies is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>
 <p><strong>USE OF WEB BEACONS</strong></p>
 <p>Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology   called web beacons, that help us better manage content on our site by   informing us what content is effective.  Web beacons are tiny graphics   with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used   to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies,   which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are   embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at   the end of this sentence.  We do not tie the information gathered by   clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p>
 <p><strong>ADVANCED COOKIES</strong></p>
 <p>The advanced cookie tracks the online patterns of LiveSample Members.   The advanced cookie, which may be placed by e-Rewards or in conjunction   with a third party, incorporates a key which can identify tags contained   in certain online content relating to our clients and their products   and services. If a LiveSample Member views a page containing any content   that includes the tag, the key will send LiveSample an update   confirming that the Member has viewed the page containing this content.   Certain web pages or web-based advertisements that you view may be   tracked, and in some cases, this tracking data may be combined with   survey answers that you provide. For example, when you visit or click on   our third-party marketing and reward partners' websites or online   advertisements these events are recorded by one of our technology   partners, which in turn reports the data to us. We combine that data   with the other information that you provide us with, such as your survey   responses and demographic information (but not with your personally   identifiable information), to provide market research analysis to our   Rewards Partners and Marketing Partners, for example on the   effectiveness of their websites and advertisements. You can opt out of   our technology partners' own data collection and ad targeting here   http://preferences.truste.com/truste. If you delete cookies on your   browser after opting out, you will have to opt out again.</p>
 <p><strong>OPTING-OUT OF OUR PANEL</strong></p>
 <p>If you desire to end your membership with the LiveSample panel, you   may terminate your membership from within your account. Go to the My   Profile section, click on Open Account Details, Open Personal Profile   and then click on "Delete Account". Upon opting out of panel membership,   we will deactivate your account and you will not receive any further   survey invitations to take surveys; although you may continue to receive   some previously prepared survey invitations for a few days following   the termination of membership. LiveSample will retain your Personal   Information for an indefinite period of time for tax and account   purposes; however, we will continue to protect your Personal Information   in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
 <p><strong>APPLICABLE LAWS</strong></p>
 <p>This Privacy Policy will be governed by and construed in accordance   with the laws of the State of Connecticut USA, without giving effect to   any principles of conflict of laws.</p>
 <p><strong>CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
 <p>We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our   information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify   you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or   by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming   effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the   latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
 <p><strong>BUSINESS TRANSFERS</strong></p>
 <p>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy   additional assets. In such transactions, the information you have   provided would be considered transferred business assets. Any sale or   transfer of LiveSample or substantially all of its business assets would   be to an entity that agreed to comply with all of the material terms of   our privacy policy.  You will be notified via email or prominent notice   on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership and control   of your personal information.</p>
 <p><strong>AGREEMENT</strong></p>
