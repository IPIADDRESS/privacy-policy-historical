<br><br>
Our servers log very basic information about each computer connecting to our site, such as IP address, device characteristics, and browser type. None of this information is associated with any identified person at the time it is collected, but it could potentially be tied to you somehow if we are required to disclose our server logs as a result of a subpoena or other legal process.
<br><br>
We store the captions you enter, as well as the background image you select. We treat this as public and freely accessible information, which is necessary for the underlying sharing functionality offered by the site. Otherwise, the site's social aspects would not work.
<br><br>
We may use cookies, web beacons, or other anonymous tracking information to improve our server's interaction with your computer. Third party vendors, including Google, also use cookies to serve ads to you based on your visit to this site and/or other sites on the Internet.
<br><br>
You may opt out of the use of Google's ad-related cookies by visiting their <a href="https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/">ad settings</a>.

We may occasionally revise our privacy policy by posting the changes here.
