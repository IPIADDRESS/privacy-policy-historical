      <p>Thank you for visiting this Internet web site located under the universal resource locator at www.livebooks.com and www.livebooksedu.com (collectively the “Site”). This Privacy Policy details certain policies implemented throughout liveBooks, Inc. (“liveBooks”) governing liveBooks’s use of personally identifiable information provided to liveBooks via this Site or through your relationship with liveBooks.</p>
      <h2>Privacy Policy Updates</h2>
      <p>Due to the Internet’s rapidly evolving nature, liveBooks may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time.

      <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
      <p>You can generally visit our Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. However, in certain sections of this Site, to use certain services or purchase products, we may require you to register for an account or we may invite you to submit questions or comments or request information.  Due to the nature of some of these activities, we may ask that you complete and submit an online form with personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, address, phone number, password, username, payment information and student status.  We may use your personally identifiable information to deliver certain services, products or information you have requested, provide you with notices regarding the products or services you have purchased, provide you with notices regarding products or services you may wish to purchase in the future, verify your authority to enter this Site and improve the content and general administration of the Site.  We also may collect your personally identifiable information that voluntarily provide to us when you submit your comments and/or feedback to the Site.</p>
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>We may use small text files called cookies to improve overall Site experience. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you other than as referred to above.</p>
      <h2>Aggregate Information</h2>
      <p>The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site and IP addresses, and we may analyze these data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information.

      <h2>Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We may provide the information we collect, including your personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies, to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us.  For example, we may provide your personally identifiable information to an organization in order to complete a service (e.g., data storage companies, or to process your payment).  Such third party entities may be obligated to not further disclose your personally identifiable information.  We will also disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority.  We may also cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any official investigation and we may disclose your personally identifiable information to the relevant agency in doing so.  We will not sell your personally identifiable information to any other company or organization except we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which liveBooks participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of liveBooks’s assets to which this Site relates.</p>
