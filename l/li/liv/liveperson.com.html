Cookies are often used to make web-browsing easier by performing functions such as saving passwords and maintaining lists of personal preferences regarding the use of the website.</p><p>Our websites, apps and Services may use the following types of cookies:</p><ul><li>Strictly Necessary Cookies – these cookies are essential to enable you to browse our websites, apps and Services and use the available features.</li><li>Performance Cookies – these cookies collect information about how you use our websites, apps and Services. For instance, these cookies track which pages you visit most. This data may be used to help optimize our websites, apps and Services and make it easier for you to navigate within them.

While LivePerson attempts to honor the DNT instructions received from a user’s browser, LivePerson cannot guarantee that it will always respond to such signals because a common industry standard for DNT has not been adopted. LivePerson will continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology.</p><p></p>
