A&nbsp;stock exchange&nbsp;or&nbsp;bourse&nbsp;is an&nbsp;exchange&nbsp;where&nbsp;stock brokers&nbsp;and&nbsp;traders&nbsp;can buy and/or sell&nbsp;stocks&nbsp;(also called shares),&nbsp;bonds, and other&nbsp;securities. Stock exchanges may also provide facilities for issue and redemption of securities and other financial instruments, and capital events including the payment of income and&nbsp;dividends. Securities traded on a stock exchange include stock issued by listed companies,&nbsp;unit trusts,&nbsp;derivatives, pooled investment products and&nbsp;bonds. Stock exchanges often function as &quot;continuous auction&quot; markets, with buyers and sellers consummating transactions at a central location, such as the&nbsp;floor of the exchange.

To be able to trade a security on a certain stock exchange, it must be&nbsp;listed&nbsp;there. Usually, there is a central location at least for record keeping, but trade is increasingly less linked to such a physical place, as modern markets use&nbsp;electronic networks, which gives them advantages of increased speed and reduced cost of transactions. Trade on an exchange is restricted to brokers who are members of the exchange. In recent years, various other trading venues, such as electronic communication networks,&nbsp;alternative trading systems&nbsp;and &quot;dark pools&quot; have taken much of the trading activity away from traditional stock exchanges.">Stocks</a>

Stocks can also be categorized in various ways. One common way is by the country where the company is domiciled.

OTC Markets Group, (previously known as &quot;Pink Sheets&quot;) is a United States financial market providing price and&nbsp;liquidity&nbsp;information for almost 10,000&nbsp;over-the-counter&nbsp;(OTC) securities. The group has its headquarters in&nbsp;New York City. OTC-traded securities are organized into three markets to inform investors of opportunities and risks:&nbsp;OTCQX,&nbsp;OTCQB&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pink.

OTC Markets Group designates securities in one of three markets to indicate the level of financial and corporate disclosure provided by the companies using its quotation system. Apart from the OTCQX market, which has rules that include financial requirements, the designations do not signify issuer quality or merit of any security. Designation is based on the level and timeliness of a company's disclosure and OTCQB and any of the Pink categories can include both high quality as well as speculative, distressed, or questionable companies. Investors are encouraged to use caution when considering many of these companies for investment.

The OTCQX and OTCQB markets are considered 'Established Public Markets' by the SEC for the purpose of determining the public market price when registering securities for resale with the SEC in equity line financings.">OTC Markets</a>

An exchange or futures market is a central financial exchange where people can trade standardized futures contracts; that is, a contract to buy specific quantities of a commodity or financial instrument at a specified price with delivery set at a specified time in the future. These types of contracts fall into the category of derivatives. The opposite of the futures market is the spots market, where trades will occur immediately (2 business days) after a transaction agreement has been made, rather than at a predetermined time in the future. Instruments are priced according to the movement of the underlying asset (stock, physical commodity, index, etc.). The aforementioned category is named &quot;derivatives&quot; because the value of these instruments are derived from another asset class.

According to The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics (Newbery 2008), futures markets &quot;provide partial income risk insurance to producers whose output is risky, but very effective insurance to commodity&nbsp;stockholders&nbsp;at remarkably low cost. Speculators absorb some of the risk but&nbsp;hedging&nbsp;appears to drive most&nbsp;commodity markets. The equilibrium price can be either below or above the (rationally) expected future price (backwardation or&nbsp;contango)...Rollover hedges can extend insurance from short-horizon contracts over longer periods.&quot;">Futures</a>

The&nbsp;foreign exchange market&nbsp;(forex,&nbsp;FX, or&nbsp;currency market) is a global&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;market for the trading of&nbsp;currencies. This includes all aspects of buying, selling and exchanging currencies at current or determined prices. In terms of volume of trading, it is by far the largest market in the world, followed by the&nbsp;Credit market.&nbsp;The main participants in this market are the&nbsp;larger international banks.&nbsp;Financial centres&nbsp;around the world function as anchors of trading between a wide range of multiple types of buyers and sellers around the clock, with the exception of weekends. The foreign exchange market does not determine the relative values of different currencies, but sets the current market price of the value of one currency as demanded against another.

The foreign exchange market works through financial institutions, and it operates on several levels. Behind the scenes banks turn to a smaller number of financial firms known as &quot;dealers&quot;, who are actively involved in large quantities of foreign exchange trading. Most foreign exchange dealers are banks, so this behind-the-scenes market is sometimes called the &quot;interbank market&quot;, although a few insurance companies and other kinds of financial firms are involved. Trades between foreign exchange dealers can be very large, involving hundreds of millions of dollars. Because of the sovereignty issue when involving two currencies, forex has little (if any) supervisory entity regulating its actions.">FX</a>

In economics, a commodity is a marketable item produced to satisfy wants or needs. Often the item is fungible. Economic commodities comprise goods and services.

The term commodity is specifically used for an economic good or service when the demand for it has no qualitative differentiation across a market. In other words, a commodity good or service has full or partial but substantial fungibility; that is, the market treats its instances as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them. As the saying goes, &quot;From the taste of wheat, it is not possible to tell who produced it, a Russian serf, a French peasant or an English capitalist.&quot; Petroleum and copper are other examples of such commodities, their supply and demand being a part of one universal market. Items such as stereo systems, on the other hand, have many aspects of product differentiation, such as the brand, the user interface and the perceived quality. The demand for one type of stereo may be much larger than demand for another.

In contrast, one of the characteristics of a commodity good is that its price is determined as a function of its market as a whole. Well-established physical commodities have actively traded spot and derivative markets. Generally, these are basic resources and agricultural products such as iron ore, sugar, rice. Soft commodities are goods that are grown, while hard commodities are ones that are extracted through mining.

There is another important class of energy commodities which includes electricity, gas, coal and oil. Electricity has the particular characteristic that it is usually uneconomical to store; hence, electricity must be consumed as soon as it is processed

Since the dawn of time, gold and silver have been recognized as valuable. And even today, precious metals have their place in a savvy investor's portfolio. But which precious metal is best for investment purposes? And why are they so volatile? If you're just getting started in precious metals, read on to learn more about how they work and how you can invest in them. There are many ways to buy into precious metals like gold, silver and platinum and a host of good reasons why you should give in to the treasure hunt.

We'll start with the grand-daddy of them all: gold. Gold is unique for its durability (it doesn't rust or otherwise corrode), malleability and its ability to conduct both heat and electricity. It has some industrial applications in dentistry and electronics, but we know it principally as a base for jewelry and as a form of&nbsp;currency.

The value of gold is determined by the market 24 hours a day, nearly seven days a week. Gold trades predominantly as a function of sentiment; its price is less affected by the&nbsp;laws of supply and demand. This is because new mine supply is vastly outweighed by the sheer size of above-ground, hoarded gold. To put it simply, when the hoarders feel like selling, the price drops. When they want to buy, new supply is quickly absorbed and the&nbsp;gold prices&nbsp;are driven higher.">Metals</a>

Grains&nbsp;are small, hard, dry&nbsp;seeds, with or without attached&nbsp;hulls&nbsp;or&nbsp;fruit&nbsp;layers, harvested for human or animal consumption. Agronomists&nbsp;also call the plants producing such seeds &quot;grain crops&quot;. The two main types of commercial grain crops are&nbsp;cereals&nbsp;such as&nbsp;wheat&nbsp;and&nbsp;rye, and&nbsp;legumes&nbsp;such as&nbsp;beans&nbsp;and&nbsp;soybeans. Ubiquity of grain as a food source encouraged use of the term to describe other particles with&nbsp;volume&nbsp;or&nbsp;mass&nbsp;similar to an individual seed.

After being harvested, dry grains are more durable than other&nbsp;staple foods, such as starchy fruits (plantains,&nbsp;breadfruit, etc.) and&nbsp;tubers&nbsp;(sweet potatoes,&nbsp;cassava, and more). This durability has made grains well suited to&nbsp;industrial agriculture, since they can be mechanically&nbsp;harvested, transported by rail or ship, stored for long periods in&nbsp;silos, and&nbsp;milled&nbsp;for&nbsp;flour&nbsp;or&nbsp;pressed&nbsp;for&nbsp;oil.

Petroleum&nbsp;is a&nbsp;naturally occurring, yellow-to-black&nbsp;liquid&nbsp;found in&nbsp;geological formations&nbsp;beneath the&nbsp;Earth's surface, which is commonly refined into various types of&nbsp;fuels. Components of petroleum are separated using a technique called&nbsp;fractional distillation.

It consists of&nbsp;hydrocarbons&nbsp;of various molecular weights and other&nbsp;organic compounds.&nbsp;The name&nbsp;petroleum&nbsp;covers both naturally occurring unprocessed&nbsp;crude oil&nbsp;and&nbsp;petroleum products&nbsp;that are made up of refined crude oil. A&nbsp;fossil fuel, petroleum is formed when large quantities of dead organisms, usually&nbsp;zooplankton&nbsp;and&nbsp;algae, are buried underneath&nbsp;sedimentary rock&nbsp;and subjected to both intense heat and pressure.

Petroleum has mostly been recovered by oil drilling (natural petroleum springs are rare). Drilling is carried out after studies of structural geology (at the reservoir scale), sedimentary basin analysis, and reservoir characterization (mainly in terms of the&nbsp;porosity&nbsp;and&nbsp;permeability&nbsp;of geologic reservoir structures) have been completed.&nbsp;It is refined and separated, most easily by&nbsp;distillation, into a large number of consumer products, from&nbsp;gasoline&nbsp;(petrol) and&nbsp;kerosene&nbsp;to&nbsp;asphalt&nbsp;and chemical&nbsp;reagents&nbsp;used to make&nbsp;plastics&nbsp;and&nbsp;pharmaceuticals.&nbsp;Petroleum is used in manufacturing a wide variety of materials,&nbsp;and it is estimated that the world consumes about 95 million&nbsp;barrels&nbsp;each day.

Concern over the&nbsp;depletion&nbsp;of the earth's&nbsp;finite reserves&nbsp;of oil, and the effect this would have on a society dependent on it, is a concept known as&nbsp;peak oil. The use of fossil fuels, such as petroleum will have a negative impact on Earth's biosphere, damaging&nbsp;ecosystems&nbsp;through events such as&nbsp;oil spills&nbsp;and releasing a range of pollutants into the air including&nbsp;ground-level ozone&nbsp;and&nbsp;sulfur dioxide&nbsp;from sulfur impurities in fossil fuels. The burning of fossil fuels plays the major role in the&nbsp;current episode of global warming.">Crude Oil</a>

FX is one of the most widely traded markets in the world, with a total daily average turnover reported to exceed $5 trillion a day.&nbsp;It's one of the largest and most liquid financial markets in the world, with different currencies constantly being exchanged as individuals, companies and organisations conduct global business. The forex market is not based in a central location or exchange, so it's open 24 hours a day from Sunday night through to Friday night.

Foreign exchange trading enables you to take advantage of rate fluctuations across a wide range of currencies. Forex is always traded in pairs – for example GBP/USD. You speculate on whether the price of one country's currency will rise or fall against the currency of another country, and take a position accordingly.

When trading forex, you always speculate on whether the price of the base currency will rise or fall against the counter currency. Therefore when trading in GBP/USD, if you think GBP will rise against USD, you go long (buy) the currency pair. Alternatively, if you think GBP will fall against USD (or that USD will rise against GBP), you go short (sell) the currency pair.

If you were right (that is if you went long GBP/USD and GBP went up in value against USD), you would make a profit. If the trade went against you, however, you would make a loss.

You can trade forex using leverage, which allows you to increase your potential profit. Please note that leveraged trading can also increase your potential loss.">FX News</a>

Politics is the process of making decisions applying to all members of each group. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of&nbsp;governance  organized control over a human community, particularly a&nbsp;state. Furthermore, it is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.

A variety of methods are deployed by politicians, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people,&nbsp;negotiation&nbsp;with other political subjects, making&nbsp;laws, and exercising&nbsp;force, including&nbsp;warfare&nbsp;against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from&nbsp;clans&nbsp;and&nbsp;tribes&nbsp;of traditional societies, through modern&nbsp;local governments,&nbsp;companies&nbsp;and institutions up to&nbsp;sovereign states, to the&nbsp;international level.

It is very often said that politicians are about power. A&nbsp;political system&nbsp;is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society.&nbsp;History of political thought&nbsp;can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as&nbsp;Plato's&nbsp;Republic,&nbsp;Aristotle's&nbsp;Politics&nbsp;and the works of&nbsp;Confucius.

They include the Vice President and heads of the executive departments. Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of Congress, the&nbsp;Senate&nbsp;and the&nbsp;House of Representatives. The judicial branch (or judiciary), composed of the&nbsp;Supreme Court&nbsp;and lower federal courts, exercises&nbsp;judicial power&nbsp;(or judiciary).

Civilization&nbsp;has a long history throughout&nbsp;Asia&nbsp;and it probably involved&nbsp;politics&nbsp;right from the start although some of the earliest discernible political structures arose in&nbsp;Mesopotamia&nbsp;with the advent of writing offering details of these politics. A large and well organized&nbsp;civil service&nbsp;the like of which arose in&nbsp;China&nbsp;is also a necessary adjunct to politics. Much of the political climate in Asia today is affected by&nbsp;colonialism&nbsp;and&nbsp;imperialism&nbsp;of the past with some states retaining close links with their former colonial governors while others involved in bitter independence struggles the consequences of which continue to be felt.

The situation today is still mixed, with hostilities in parts of Asia such as the continuing tensions over&nbsp;Kashmir, primarily between&nbsp;India&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pakistan, as well as economic competitiveness between the&nbsp;People's Republic of China&nbsp;and India.

Australia's six states and two territories are structured within a political framework similar to that of the Commonwealth. Each state has its own bicameral Parliament, with the exception of Queensland and the two Territories, whose Parliaments are unicameral. Each state has a Governor, who undertakes a role equivalent to that of the Governor-General at the federal level, and a Premier, who is the head of government and is equivalent to the Prime Minister. Each state also has its own supreme court, from which appeals can be made to the High Court of Australia.

Elections in the six&nbsp;Australian states&nbsp;and two territories are held at least once every four years. In&nbsp;New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the&nbsp;Australian Capital Territory, election dates are fixed by legislation. However, the other&nbsp;state premiers&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Chief Minister of the Northern Territory&nbsp;have the same discretion in calling elections as the Prime Minister at national level.

Local government in Australia is the third (and lowest) tier of government, administered by the&nbsp;states and territories&nbsp;which in turn are beneath the federal tier. Unlike the United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand, there is only one level of local government in all states, with no distinction such as counties and cities. Today, most local governments have equivalent powers within a state, and styles such as &quot;shire&quot; or &quot;city&quot; refer to the nature of the settlements they are based around.">Australia</a>

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-1460"><a href="http://www.livetradingnews.com/health" title="The latest health news from around the world, as well as tips and information to help you improve your health and wellbeing.

Many methods to improve your health are pretty straightforward: to lose weight, eat less and exercise more; to boost your energy, get more sleep; to prevent dehydration, drink more water. Others, however, are totally counterintuitive. The following tips really do work—but they may leave you scratching your head.

Don't brush your teeth immediately after meals and drinks, especially if they were acidic. Acidic foods—citrus fruits, sports drinks, tomatoes, soda (both diet and regular)—can soften tooth enamel &quot;like wet sandstone,&quot; says Howard R. Gamble, immediate past president of the Academy of General Dentistry. Brushing your&nbsp;teeth&nbsp;at this stage can speed up acid's effect on your enamel and erode the layer underneath. Gamble suggests waiting 30 to 60 minutes before brushing.

Muscle weight, that is. If two women both weigh 150 pounds and only one lifts weights, the lifter will more likely fit into a smaller pant size than her sedentary counterpart. Likewise, a 150-pound woman who lifts weights could very well wear the same size as a 140-pound woman who doesn't exercise. The reason: Although a pound of fat weighs the same as a pound of muscle, muscle takes up less space, says Mark Nutting, fitness director of SACO Sport &amp; Fitness in Saco, Maine.&nbsp;&quot;You can get bigger muscles and get smaller overall if you lose the fat,&quot; he says. &quot;The bulk so many women fear only occurs if you don't lose fat and develop muscle on top of it.&quot; Cut back on calories and add weight to your workout to lose inches.">Health</a>

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-2351983"><a href="http://www.livetradingnews.com/horse_racing" title="Horse racing is an equestrian performance sport, involving two or more jockeys riding horses over a set distance for competition. It is one of the most ancient of all sports and its basic premise – to identify which of two or more horses is the fastest over a set course or distance – has remained unchanged since the earliest times.[1]

Horse races vary widely in format. Often, countries have developed their own particular horse racing traditions. Variations include restricting races to particular breeds, running over obstacles, running over different distances, running on different track surfaces and running in different gaits.

While horses are sometimes raced purely for sport, a major part of horse racing's interest and economic importance lies in the gambling associated with it, an activity that in 2008 generated a worldwide market worth around US$115 billion.[">Horse Racing</a>

<p>California Online Privacy Protection Act</p>
<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. – See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>
<p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:<br>
Users can visit our site anonymously.<br>
Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.<br>
Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified above.</p>

<p>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?<br>
It’s also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>
<p>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</p>
<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.</p>
<p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>
<p>Fair Information Practices</p>
<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:<br>
We will notify you via email<br>
      • Within 1 business day</p>
<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
<p>CAN SPAM Act</p>
<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
