<p><b>WELCOME TO THE LIVEPHISH.COM PRIVACY
POLICY</b></p>

<p>-updated as of May 25, 2018</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting livephish.com. Your privacy is
important to us. This privacy policy describes the information we collect, what
we do with it, and the choices you can make about the way your information is
collected and used at livephish.com.&nbsp; Please review our privacy policy as it
may change from time to time in the future (when we change the policy in a
material way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated
Privacy Policy) and contact us at <a href="mailto:help@livephish.com">help@livephish.com</a>
if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

<p><b>The Information We Collect</b></p>

<p>At livephish.com and livephish.com websites, you can
order products, express an opinion, and subscribe to services such as online
newsletters and paid streaming. The types of personally identifiable information
that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, location, e-mail
address, telephone number, fax number, contact preferences, credit card
information, Internet protocol address, date of birth, and details of how you
use and interact with our websites (e.g. your search queries, a record of
customer service emails, access dates and times, referring website addresses).</p>

<p>At some parts of some of our websites, only persons
who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be
able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the
site's activities and offerings.</p>

<p>We also may collect some non-personally identifiable
information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser
you are using (e.g. Safari, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system
you are using and information about your Internet service provider (e.g.
Comcast, AT&amp;T) or device (e.g. iPhone 6, MacBook Pro) and other
user-related general data (e.g. zip code, area code).</p>

<p><b>How We Use the Information</b></p>

<p>We may use the information you provide about yourself
to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond
to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products,
programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.&nbsp; We sometimes
use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when a
concert you have purchased is available for download or when we make changes to
our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online
newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.&nbsp; If you enter into a
giveaway, contest or other promotion, we may use the information you provide to
administer those programs.</p>

<p>The information we collect in connection with our website
is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to
facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time
to time, to offer you new products, programs, or services.&nbsp; As is the case with
most Internet services, we obtain some information automatically and store it
in log files.&nbsp; We use this and other information to understand and analyze
trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to
improve our products and services, and to gather demographic information about
our users.&nbsp; We may use this information to market and advertise our products
and services.</p>

<p>You are not required to provide any
personally-identifiable information that we have requested, but if you choose
not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our
products or services or respond to any questions you may have.</p>

<p>We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable
information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and
to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may share
non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners and use
this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer
you products, programs, or services.</p>

<p>We may disclose personally identifiable information in
response to legal process (e.g. in response to a court order or a subpoena) or
to enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential
violations.&nbsp; We also may disclose such information to detect, prevent or
otherwise address fraud, intellectual property violations, security or
technical issues, to protect our operations or users, or to respond to a law
enforcement agency's request.&nbsp; Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger
or sale we may transfer any and all information we collect to the relevant
third party.</p>

<p>Agents and contractors of livephish.com who have
access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this
information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for
example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the
services they are performing for livephish.com.&nbsp; Agents and contractors of
livephish.com will comply with all laws regulating these matters, including the
General Data Protection Regulation (EU).</p>

<p>Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard
against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that
personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in
a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice.</p>

<p>Finally, livephish.com websites will not use or
transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated
to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to
opt out of these unrelated uses.&nbsp; For example, if you don’t want to be on our
mailing list, you can opt out by updating your settings or contacting us at <a href="mailto:help@livephish.com">help@livephish.com</a>.</p>

identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in

do so, we’ll also tell you who we’ve shared your personal information with so
that you can contact them directly.</p>

<p>With regard to your right to restrict processing, you
can ask us to ‘block’ or suppress the processing of your personal information
in certain circumstances such as where you contest the accuracy of that
personal information or object to us processing it.&nbsp; It won’t stop us from
storing your personal information though.&nbsp; We will tell you before we lift any
restriction.&nbsp; If we’ve shared your personal information with others, we’ll let
them know about the restriction where possible.&nbsp; If you ask us, where possible
and lawful to do so, we’ll also tell you who we’ve shared your personal
information with so that you can contact them directly.</p>

with (in a structured, commonly-used format) and to reuse it elsewhere.</p>

<p>With regard to your right to object, you can ask us to
stop processing your personal information, and we will do so, if we are:
relying on our own or someone else’s legitimate interests to process your
personal information except if we can demonstrate compelling legal grounds for
the processing; processing your personal information for direct marketing; or
processing your personal information for research unless such processing is
necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.</p>

<p>With regard to your rights in relation to automated
decision-making and profiling, you have the right not to be subject to a
decision when it’s based on automatic processing, including profiling, and it

<p>With regard to your right to withdraw content, if we
rely on your consent (or explicit consent) as our legal basis for processing
your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any
time.</p>

<p>We will perform Data Protection Impact Assessments to
identify risks to consumer data and Data Protection Compliance Reviews to
ensure those risks are addressed.</p>

<p>In the event of a security breach involving your
personal user data, we will notify you within 72 hours of learning of the
breach and will provide specific details of the breach such as the nature of it
and the approximate number of data subjects affected.</p>
