<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Newsletters:</strong></p>
<p>You may sign up and subscribe to receive our newsletters. We may use the information that you provide to us, such as your date of birth, sex, or other preferences, to provide customized newsletters that may be of interest to you. You have the option to unsubscribe to newsletters at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected:</strong></p>
<p>What will you do with my email address? You will receive our daily Living Deal offer and information about other products and services which may be of interest to you in your inbox (if you have signed up for it), and occasional alerts relating to your purchase(s). What will you do with my credit card and billing information? This information is recorded via a Secure Socket Layer connection (SSL) and is fully encrypted. Your information is VERY SECURE! We value security as much as you do.</p>
<p>We collect two types of information from you: (i) information that you voluntarily provide to us; and (ii) information derived through automatic tracking mechanisms.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific end user. When you engage in certain activities on the LivingDeal.com website, such as creating an account, ordering a product or service from us or our partners, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums, entering a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by us or our partners, filling out a survey, posting a review, sending us or our partners feedback, requesting information about our services, submitting an affiliate agreement, applying for a job, posting a video or signing up for special offers from third parties through the website (collectively, "Identification Activities"), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an "Identification Activity". If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip/postal code), email address, telephone number and date of birth. When you order products or services, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.</p>
<p>We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide products and services to you, administer sweepstakes and contests, enhance the operation of the website, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze website usage, improve our product and service offerings, and to tailor your experience with third parties as provided within this Privacy Policy. For example, if you send our customer service an email we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your comment in our marketing materials or on our website. In addition, if you use our website to send information or a product to another person, we may store your personal information, and the personal information of any recipient. We may use that other person's contact information to allow him or her to view and accept your gift or to allow the recipient to access the information you requested we send. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our website Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.</p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific end user. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming to our website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our website, the type of browser you are using and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. We, and/or our authorized third party service providers and advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our website through the use of electronic tools like cookies and web beacons or pixel tags, as described in this Privacy Policy. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, however if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the website. We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized third party service providers and advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.</p>
<p><strong>How we use your Personally Identifiable Information:</strong></p>
<p>We only use your Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes for which it is collected or as otherwise set out in this policy. We may share your information with Authorized Third Party Service Providers since we provide services and products through third parties. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, process credit card payments, troubleshoot, and provide customer service. We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies (“Affiliates”) with whom we have business relationships and may share your information with Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. For example, when you order a service, we release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the service and, if applicable, release your address to the delivery service to deliver the service. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.</p>
<p>We may remarket your Personally Identifiable Information to third party advertisers, service providers and suppliers for secondary marketing purposes. Remarketing is a way for us to connect with users, based upon your past interactions with the LivingDeal.com website. Third-party marketing vendors may be hired to perform remarketing services. Third-party vendors may use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits. Users may opt out of the use of cookies by visiting the search engine’s advertising opt-out page, for example, if you use the Google search engine, at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy</a>. This information is used only for remarketing purposes and will not be used by them for any other purpose.</p>
<p>We may share some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information with Living Deal Corp.’s related and affiliated companies, so that they may send daily deal e-mails to you, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personally Identifiable Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any entity that acquires us may continue to process your Personally Identifiable Information in the normal course of their business activities.</p>
<p>In addition, we may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect and defend our rights or property, you, or third parties. You hereby consent to us sharing your Personal Information under the circumstances described herein.</p>
