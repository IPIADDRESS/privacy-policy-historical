	<p>Your privacy is important to LiveOps. This statement describes how LiveOps  handles and views the personal information of visitors to the LiveOps websites.</p>
	<strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong><br>
	Personal information means any information  that may be used to identify an individual, including but not limited to, a  first and last name, a national identification number, an email address, postal  or physical address or other contact information, occupation, industry or other  information including market questions needed to answer a request, to better  provide information and services or to comply with various national, state,  provincial or local government reporting requirements.&nbsp; The submission of personal information is  voluntary. LiveOps may collect personal information as described below. In each  case, we only collect personal information that we believe to be relevant and  required to provide an individual with requested information and services and  to conduct our business. LiveOps may collect personal  information for purposes that include but are not limited to:
	<ul type="disc">
      <li>Viewing/accessing of white       papers, technical briefs or product/service offering demonstrations</li>
	  <li>Participation in marketing       promotions, events, seminars, webinars, podcasts, teleconferences, executive       roundtables, direct mail or general marketing</li>
	  <li>Career opportunities or other       Human Resources activities</li>
	  <li>Opportunities to become       certified as a LiveOps Agent</li>
	  <li>User surveys</li>
	  <li>Use of our websites       specifically for our Customers or Business Partners</li>
	  <li>Responding to a formal       inquiry</li>
	  <li>In addition, when accessing       certain documents or services on our website, visitors may be asked to       provide certain information, such as how they can be contacted, where they       work, and what they do. We may also track non-personal information (also       see Use of Cookies, Web Beacons and other Technologies in this Privacy       Policy Statement) about web pages and content accessed by visitors to       LiveOps’ website and the number of times such content is accessed by a       specific visitor. LiveOps collects this non-personal information in an       effort to improve the quality of its website and also to answer questions       as well as improve delivery and quality of information to visitors of the       LiveOps websites.</li>
	  </ul>
	<p><strong>LiveOps Discussion Forums and Chat Rooms</strong><br>
	    If you participate in a LiveOps discussion  forum or chat room, you should be aware that the information you provide there  will be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside  LiveOps, who have access to that discussion forum or chat room. Also, please  recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and  conditions. Each participant's opinion on a forum or chat room is his or her  own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of LiveOps.<br>
        <br>	  
        <strong>Third Party Sites</strong><br>
        LiveOps’ websites may, from time to time, provide links to other third party  websites which are outside our control and not covered by this Policy and may  be different from this Policy. You may wish to review the privacy policies  posted on all third party websites.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Privacy of  Minors and Children</strong><br>
	    Our websites do not and will not target and are not intended to solicit or  attract children. LiveOps does not knowingly solicit personal information from  children or send them requests for personal information. For the purposes of  this document, children means anyone under the age of 13.<br>  
        <br>
        <strong>Use of Suppliers<br>
            </strong>In some cases LiveOps uses suppliers to  collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is  LiveOps' practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner  consistent with LiveOps policies. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies</strong><br>
        We sometimes collect non-identifiable  information from visits to our websites to help us provide better customer  service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and  we also measure visitor activity on LiveOps Web sites, but we do so in ways  that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known  as "clickstream data." LiveOps or others on LiveOps' behalf may use  this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better  customer service. <br>
        <br>
	    Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may  extract some information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format  and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream  data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help  us understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an  individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this  manner you can disable your cookies.<br>
        <br>
        We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through  the use of various technologies, including "cookies." A cookie is a  piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored  on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you.  Some LiveOps pages use cookies, sent by LiveOps or its third party vendors, or  other technologies to better serve you when you return to the website. You can  set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the  chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn  off cookies. If you do so, however, some of our websites may not work properly.<br>
        <br>
	    Some LiveOps websites also use Web beacon or other technologies to better  tailor those sites to provide better customer service. These technologies may  be in use on a number of pages across LiveOps' websites. When a visitor  accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated  which may be processed by us or by our suppliers. These Web beacons usually  work in conjunction with cookies. If you don't want your cookie information to  be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn  off cookies.<br>
        <br>
	    If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect  visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with  other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded.<br>
        <br> 
        <strong>Service Quality Monitoring <br>
          </strong>Certain Web transactions may also involve  you calling us or our calling you. Please be aware that it is LiveOps' general  practice to monitor and in some cases record such calls for training or quality  assurance purposes.<br>
        <br> 
        <strong>Online Advertising</strong><br>
	    Although we do not present online  advertising on our Web site today, we may engage certain companies to help us  deliver interactive on-line advertising such as banner ads. These companies may  collect and use information about customers. After it is collected the  information is aggregated so it is not identifiable to a specific individual. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br>
	    This Privacy Policy was last updated on March  30, 2007. A notice will be posted on our website home page for 30 days whenever  this Policy is changed in a material way.<br>
        <br> 
        <strong>Privacy Questions and Access</strong><br>
	    If you have a question about this  statement, you can send an email to the LiveOps website coordinator at <a href="mailto:privacy@liveops.com">privacy@liveops.com</a>. You can also contact  us at this address if you have a question about LiveOps' handling of your  information. <br>
        <br>
	    If you wish to obtain a copy of particular information you provided to  LiveOps, or if you become aware the information is incorrect and you would like  us to correct it contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@liveops.com">privacy@liveops.com</a>.<br>
        <br>
	    Before LiveOps is able to provide you with any information or correct any  inaccuracies, however, we may ask you to verify your identity and to provide  other details to help us to respond to your request. We will endeavor to  respond within an appropriate timeframe.<br>
