          <h6>Security.</h6>
          <p>Data transmissions over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be fully and absolutely
            secure. Our website and our services have security measures in place designed to protect against
            the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our security measures include
            the following.
          </p>
          <h6>Encryption and Firewalls.</h6>
          <p>Chat transcripts are encrypted during transmission. We use standard
            Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption that encodes information for such transmissions. Transcripts
            are maintained and archived on secure servers. Access to such data is protected by multi-layered
            security controls including firewalls, role-based access controls and passwords. Data is backed up
            daily and archives are stored off-site in a secure location.
          </p>
          <h6>Third-Party Websites.</h6>
          <p>LiveHelpNow is not responsible for and does not control the privacy
            practices of any business customer of LiveHelpNow or any other third party. We encourage you to
            review the privacy practices of each third party.
          </p>
          <h6>Business Transfers.</h6>
          <p>In the event that all or substantially all of LiveHelpNow’s assets have
            been acquired, or in the event of any merger, bankruptcy or reorganization involving LiveHelpNow,
            all Transcripts, Recordings and Surveys, as well as all other information about you and your use
            of our services will likely be included in the acquired or merged assets.
          </p>
          <h6>Choice Regarding Personal Information.</h6>
          <p>If you elect to engage in any communication using our
            services, or submit any request or application to LiveHelpNow via LiveHelpNow’s Website, it is
            up to you to decide what, if any, information to provide. Depending on the circumstances it may
            not be possible to communicate with you or address all of your questions without providing some
            information. Nevertheless, if you do not wish to furnish certain information, then you should not do so.
