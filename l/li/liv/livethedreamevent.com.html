<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This privacy policy (the “Privacy  Policy”) discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for  this website. We will notify you of changes to our Privacy Policy by posting  the new policy on this website. Review our Privacy Policy regularly so that you  can stay informed of our practices, as they may change in the future.</p>
<p>By using our services or submitting  information, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Your  assent to these practices is essential for us to provide our services.  Similarly, we need you to provide accurate personal information so that you can  be contacted and use our website and related services. You can opt-out and  decide not to provide the requested personal information. However, by doing so,  we will not be able to contact you and you will not be able to use our website  and/or services.</p>
<p>The personal information we collect  includes name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, user name, and password.  Other personal information that you may submit is clearly labeled at the time  you submit it. We use the information that we collect to provide our services,  to contact you regarding our products and services, and to improve our site. We  also share your name, address, telephone number, and other contact details with  the member, if any, who referred you to our website. Once a third-party obtains  your personal information, its subsequent use is controlled by their business  practices, which is beyond our control. By providing us a telephone number  and/or email address, you are expressly requesting that we and/or anyone to  whom we subsequently share or transfer your personal information contact you at  that number or email address. Note, however, that your payment information is  used only for order processing purposes.</p>
<p>We automatically collect certain  information from visitors to, and members of, the site, such as Internet  addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring and exit  page, operating system, timestamps, and clickstream data. We also track and  analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information  from our visitors and customers. This information is logged to help diagnose  technical problems, and to administer our site so that we can constantly  improve the quality of the services we provide.</p>
<p>When you pay for anything on our  site using a credit or debit card—including your monthly membership fee—we collect  the personal information needed to complete the transaction. This information  includes your name, card number, and other necessary information, all of which  is clearly labeled on the form you use to submit payment. We use an  unaffiliated, credit card processing company to process your payment. We  transfer your payment information—and you authorize us to do so—to this company  solely for this purpose. The company does not retain, share, store, or use  personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>
<p>Anything you send us, post on our  site, or use with our service, such as emails or voice recordings, or if other  users or third parties send us anything about your activities or postings, we  will collect such information into a file specific to you. We use information  in the file that we maintain for you, and other information that we obtain from  your use of the services, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and  enforce our membership agreements.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  We take measures to prevent the  loss, misuse, and alteration of your information. We carefully limit access to  the database in which your personal information is stored. Additionally, we share  and/or transfer your personal information only in the ways set forth in this  privacy policy.</p>
<p>We cannot ensure that all of your  private communications and other personally identifiable information will never  be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For  example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third  parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept  or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us  to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government  officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in  connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements,  or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability. We may  also (and you authorize us to) disclose personal information about you to  credit agencies, collection agencies, and/or merchant database agencies, as we  deem necessary</p>
<p>Contact us at the address below if  you want us to change or delete any information that we have about you. We will  respond to your request to access, update, or delete your information within  ten (10) business days. Before we are able to provide you with any information,  correct any inaccuracies, or delete any information, however, we may ask you to  verify your identity.<br>
