(last updated:December 15, 2003) 
<p>At Microsoft, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement explains the data collection and use practices of the Microsoft Office Live Meeting ("Live Meeting")Web site ,Microsoft Office Live Meeting services, and associated software (the "Services"). Microsoft Office Live Meeting is a service provided by Placeware, Inc., A Microsoft Company ("Placeware"). This privacy statement does not apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites, products or services. By using the Services, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy statement.</p>

<p><span class="SupportSubHeads">Collecting Your Business Information</span><br>
Information that is provided by meeting organizers or administrators such as meeting schedules, attendee lists, subject matter, and content of any Web presentations, live or recorded, visual or audio and any content uploaded to our servers by meeting organizers or administrators ("Business Information") are considered confidential to the purchaser or co-sponsor of the event or conference center where such information was provided. We will not view Business Information except as necessary to appropriately support the service. We will use Business Information for the purpose of service capacity planning; anticipating, diagnosing, supporting or resolving any problems that might limit or disrupt the Services; and improving the quality of the Services. Any Business Information collected during the meeting is also used to facilitate debugging during development, or to debug customer escalations that are being reproduced in real time. </p>

<p><span class="SupportSubHeads">Collecting Your Personal Information</span><br>
We will collect your personal information if you choose to register or request information for the Services or participate in a meeting facilitated by the Services. The information we collect includes your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, facsimile number, company name, job title, and information about your company as well as information about the nature of your usage of our service, including the number of meeting attendees, duration and frequency of meetings, and total number of meetings. </p>

<p>Furthermore, as part of the Services, we collect and log information generated from the consoles of meeting participants including but not limited to which meeting participants viewed slides during the presentation, questions and answers that are delivered to meeting presenters and participants, slide transitions, notes or annotations made by you and any other meeting participants, application sharing, posting of comments, or requests for prints or downloads of presentations. This information may also be viewed by other meeting participants. We also collect detailed polling results identified at the user level and how each individual user voted. This information is also shared with the party who is hosting or sponsoring the meeting. </p>

<p><strong>The Services may also collect and record real time communication "chat" between users. As part of the Services, any user may initiate the recording function which will result in the conversation and communications of each user being recorded and logged. </strong></p>

<p>We may collect certain information about your visit, such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Web site; the pages that you access while at the Web site and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site. This information is used to help improve the Services, analyze trends, and administer the Services. </p>

<p>Live Meeting incorporates an Event Data Recorder (EDR) that captures error report data and sends it to Microsoft via the Internet. Error report data is used to assess and correct errors or problems that may occur during use of the Live Meeting service. EDR error reporting is automatically triggered when Live Meeting detects a software error. You can trigger EDR error reporting by selecting About Conference Center from the Help menu, and pressing the Send Configuration to Technical Support button. You are asked for your consent before EDR error reports are sent to Microsoft. EDR error reports collect information about what the software was doing when it experienced the problem, and about your machine's configuration. It is possible that EDR error reporting may collect personal or confidential information and business information as part of the error report. For example, a snapshot of memory may include your name, part of a document you were viewing or sharing, part of a presentation you were viewing or sharing, or application or desktop data you were viewing or sharing during your meeting. If you are concerned that the report may contain personal or confidential information or business information do not send the error report. The following is a non-exhaustive list of other information that may be collected as part of an EDR error report: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Description &amp; location of the exception </li>
	<li>Windows OS version</li>
	<li>Internet Explorer version</li>
	<li>Machine name</li>
	<li>Processor type, model, and manufacturer.</li>
	<li>Amount of RAM, hard disk size, number of processors</li>
