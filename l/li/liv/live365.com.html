		<div id="subTitle">Privacy Policy</div>
		
		<br>
		
		This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for www.live365.com. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@live365.com">privacypolicy@live365.com</a> by email. 
	
		
		<br>
		
		<br>
		
		<div id="subTitle">1. Introduction</div>
		
		<br>
		
		Live365.com, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. This statement discloses Live365.com's privacy practices and is incorporated into, and subject to the terms of, Live365.com's Terms of Use. The purpose of this statement is to inform you as to:
		
		<ul class="desc">
		
		 <li class="desc">What kinds of information Live365.com collects from users of the Live365.com Web site and how such information is collected;</li>
		 
		 <li class="desc">How the information is used by Live365.com;</li>
		 
		 <li class="desc">Whether Live365.com discloses any user information to third parties;</li>
		 
		 <li class="desc">How you can access, update or delete any information collected about you by Live365.com; and</li>
		 
		 <li class="desc">The security procedures implemented by Live365.com to protect your personal information.</li>
		
		</ul>
		
		<br>
		
		Live365.com may change this policy from time to time. If so, any such changes will be posted on this page, so that Live365.com may keep its users informed of its information collection practices. Accordingly, we recommend that you consult this page frequently so that you are aware of our latest policy. 
		
		<br>
		
		<br>
		
		<div id="subTitle">2. How We Collect Information</div>
		
		<br>
		
		When you sign up to use Live365.com, we will ask you to create a member name. This member name will identify you when you post messages to our Web site, or when you engage in certain other activities on the site, such as transmitting Internet radio programs. In almost all cases, we do not obtain any personally identifiable information about you unless you choose to reveal it. Examples of when you voluntarily submit such information include when you provide an email address on the registration page, volunteer demographic information in conjunction with sweepstakes or contests, send us email, respond to emails from us, post messages or upload content using our service. Thus, you are not required to disclose any personally identifiable information to us, although many parts of our site may not be available to you unless you do so. For example, you must provide your name and contact information to us in the event you choose to upload content using our service, in the event you sign up to transmit Internet radio programs, or in certain other situations. We may also receive personally identifiable information about you from other users or third parties who may communicate with us about you (such as in the case of complaints).
		
		<br>
		
		<br>

		When feasible, we do automatically collect your IP address. We also automatically collect and store statistics and other information about you and your online activities both on an aggregated, non-personally identifiable basis and in a manner that may allow us to associate such information with other personally identifiable information about you. 
		
		<br>
		
		<br>
		
		<div id="subTitle">3. How We Use and Disclose Your Information</div>
		
		<br>
		
		We use your information on an aggregated basis to do such things as operate our site, enhance and improve our service and sell and deliver advertising and merchandise. We also use this data, both aggregated and personally identifiable, to enhance your onsite experience-by displaying promotions, advertisements and content that we believe will be of interest to you. We disclose aggregated information about our site to third parties. 
		
		<br>
		
		<br>
		
		We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">visit networkadvertising.org.</a>
		
		<br>
		
		<br>

		As a general practice, we do not sell to, or share your personally identifiable information with third parties. So, for example, we do not sell your email addresses to spammers or sell your name and personal demographic information to mass marketers. However, on particular pages where we ask for your personally identifiable information, we may explicitly tell you that the data we are collecting on that page will be provided to third parties, in which case those disclosures shall override anything to the contrary in this policy. We may on occasion, email offers to you of products and services in conjunction with our partners. 
		
		<br>
		
		<br>

		In some cases we use your personally identifiable information to provide information to you, such as to send newsletters and email that you request or to personalize the site in accordance with your requests. We will provide you with directions in all emails and newsletters on how to be taken off our newsletter list. 
		
		<br>
		
		<br>

		Note that some online activities in which you choose to participate do necessarily lead to disclosure of your personally identifiable information to third parties, such as when you include your name and email address in messages posted to public areas on our site (such as chat areas) or sent via our service. In these cases, your choice to disclose personally identifiable information is voluntary. However, as a necessary incident of our service, we will make your member name available for all visitors to see in certain circumstances. 
		
		<br>
		
		<br>

		When you order merchandise from vendors or other users, we may make your name and email address available to such vendors or other users in order to facilitate such transactions.  
		
		<br>
		
		<br>
		
		<div id="subTitle">4. Controlling or Changing Your Information</div>
		
		<br>
		
		You can access and update your contact information and preferences by going to your Member profile  and following the instructions on that page. However, to the extent that such information is also stored in other databases, we cannot always ensure that such corrections or deletions will immediately reach the other databases. Also, you cannot manually change your IP address, although we may change it automatically. If you have any questions, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@live365.com">privacypolicy@live365.com</a>.
		
		<br>
		
		<br>
		
		<div id="subTitle">5. Cookies and Other Tracking Methods</div>
		
		<br>
		
		Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our site. We use cookies on our site for a number of reasons. First, cookies can help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Second, cookies allow us to better understand how users use our site, which in turn helps us focus our resources on features that are most popular with our users. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly in that case.
		
		<br>
		
		<br>

		In addition to using cookies, in some circumstances we may track or collect information about your activities on our site by the numeric address assigned to the computer you are using (your IP address) or by the URLs that you come from or leave to. This information is collected and shared with our partners in an aggregated, non-personally identifiable basis. 
		
		<br>
		
		<br>
		
		<div id="subTitle">6. Other Sites</div>
		
		<br>
		
		The Live365.com Web site contains links and references to other Web sites and organizations, including Web sites owned or operated by Live365.com's advertisers. Please note that different rules may apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third party service providers or vendors or any other sites you encounter on the Internet (even if these sites are branded with our branding or framed by our site). We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third parties.
		
		<br>
		
		<br>
		
		<div id="subTitle">7. Limits on Our Abilities</div>
		
		<br>
		
		Although your privacy is very important to us, due to the existing legal and technical environment, we cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries. 
		
		<br>
		
		<br>
		
		<div id="subTitle">8. Security</div>
		
		<br>
		
		We use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers where appropriate. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
