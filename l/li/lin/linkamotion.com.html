<h4>Please Fully Read The Linkamotion Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>Linkamotion strives to offer its members the   many advantages  of Internet technology and to provide an interactive   and personalized  experience. We may use Personally Identifiable   Information (your name,  e-mail address, street address, telephone   number) subject to the terms  of this privacy policy. We will never   sell, barter, or rent your email  address to any unauthorized third   party. Period.</p>
<h3><strong>How we gather information from users</strong></h3>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are    visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the    services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information    when you register for access to certain portions of our site or  request   certain features, such as membership or when you make a  purchase. You   may provide information when you participate in   contests and other  interactive areas of   our site. Like most Web sites, Linkamotion  also collects information   automatically and through the use of  electronic tools that may be   transparent to our visitors and members. For example,  we may log the name of your   Internet Service Provider or use cookie  technology to recognize you and   hold information from your visit.  Among other things, the cookie may   store your user name and password,  sparing you from having to re-enter   that information each time you  visit, or may control the number of times   you encounter a particular  advertisement while visiting our site.&nbsp; As  we  adopt additional  technology, we may also gather information through   other means. In  certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with   information, for  example by setting your browser to refuse to accept   cookies, but if  you do you may be unable to access certain portions of   the site or may  be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we   may not be  able to customize the site’s features according to your   preferences.</p>
<h3><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong></h3>
<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your    visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We    respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify    you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine  information   about your usage patterns with similar information  obtained from other   users to help enhance our site and services (e.g.,  to learn which  pages  are visited most or what features are most  attractive).&nbsp;&nbsp;  Aggregated  Information may occasionally be shared with  our advertisers  and business  partners. Again, this information does  not include any  Personally  Identifiable Information about you or allow  anyone to  identify you  individually.</p>
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected from your Linkamotion membership to communicate with you about your  registration  and  customization preferences; our Terms of Service and  privacy  policy;  services and products offered by Linkamotion.com and other  topics we  think you might find  of interest.</p>
