<h6>1. Your Personal Profile</h6>

<p>
    When we ask information of you, our primary interest is to provide you with more personalized service. We
    respect your privacy and do not sell, rent or trade your name or personal details to other organizations except as
    outlined in this policy.
</p>

<h6>2. Security measures</h6>

<p>
    The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to
    protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you
    enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that
    information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
</p>

<p>
    If you ever discover a fraudulent charge from Lingoda on your billing statement, please contact us and
    you must report it immediately to your credit card provider, in accordance with their standard procedures.
</p>

<p>
    This site makes use of forums, bulletin boards and chat rooms. Please remember that any information you
    disclose in these areas becomes public. You should always be cautious about the amount of personal information
    you give to anyone in this context.
</p>

<p>
    We also insist on password verification at sign-in to protect against unauthorized access to your personal profile
    and course history. If you leave the computer unattended without logging out of the site, we log you out
    automatically after some time has passed.
</p>

<p>
    Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are
    granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally
    identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
</p>

<p>
    Despite these security procedures and practices, as is the case with all computer networks connected to the
    Internet, Lingoda cannot guarantee the security of your personal information or any other information
    provided over the Internet and will not be responsible for breaches of security.
</p>

<p>
    No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
    Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>

<h6>3. Communications From The Site</h6>

<p>
    You have the ability to unsubscribe from any email sent from our site at anytime, by simply clicking on the
    unsubscribe link included at the bottom of each email we send.
</p>

<p>
    We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For
    instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.
</p>

<p>
    Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish
    to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.
</p>

<h6>4. Protection of Children’s Information</h6>

<p>
    We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. This and all of our websites are general audience sites
    and not designed or intended to attract children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit
    personal information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13, nor do we send them requests for
    personal information, unless we first obtain permission from that child's parent or legal guardian.
</p>

    trial or become a user of our community services, you need to become a member of Lingoda. During
    registration we collect information such as your name and email address. We also ask for demographic
    information (such as age and gender) in order for you to create a profile. You may also be asked to supply us with
    credit card information, so that you can pay for the services you request. This information is encrypted on a
    secure server. As a member, you will be added to our mailing list to receive occasional emails about service
    information, special offers, and promotions from Lingoda and other companies within the Easy
    Languages group of companies.

    our agreements. Note that your free account remains active even if your subscription to our paid services has

<h6>8. Who We Share Your Information With</h6>

        these companies can market their products or services to you. For a complete picture of what Lingoda
        Products and Services are available, please visit www.lingoda.com. The only information we share with
        other companies within the Lingoda group of companies is your name, age group, email address, and
        country. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact our Customer
        Service team.
    </li>
    <li>
        We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business
        activities such as processing your payment or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use
        your personal information <i>only as necessary to provide </i> these services to us
    </li>
    <li>
        We may also disclose your personal information
    </li>
    <li>
        as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process
    </li>
    <li>
        when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the
        safety of
        others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,
    </li>
    <li>
        if Lingoda is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be
        notified
        via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal
        information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information,
    </li>
    <li>
        to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.
    </li>
</ul>

<h6>9. Cookies</h6>

<p>
    "Cookies" are small pieces of information that we store on your computer's browser or hard drive. We and our
    partners use cookies to remember personal information when you visit our website. For example, if you choose
    the view our site in French we will store that information in your cookie so we can show you our site in French the
    next time you visit. We also use them to store your login ID to make it easier for you to login to our site. Most
    browsers allow you the option of preventing cookies from being stored on your computer, though doing so will
    cause you to lose many of the benefits of Lingoda.
</p>

<p>
    We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your
    browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
</p>

<p>
    We use the service of a third party tracking utility company to track the behavior of visitors to our site. However,
    we do not have access to or control over their cookies. The information we collect through our third party tracking
    utility company is completely anonymous and is used to improve our services and marketing efforts.
</p>

<p>
    As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information
    includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring
    and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to understand
    and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic
    information about our user base as a whole.
</p>

<h6>10. Web Beacons</h6>

<p>
    We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage
    content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique
    identifier,
    similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies,
    which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about
    the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our
    customers’ personally identifiable information.
</p>

<p>
    We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This
    allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing
    campaigns.
</p>

<p>
    In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Lingoda website.
    When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the
    destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics
    and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you
    should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.
</p>

<h6>11. Quizes and Contests</h6>

<p>
    We may provide you the opportunity to participate in quizzes or contests on our site. If you participate, we will
    request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these quizzes and contests is
    completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested
    information typically includes contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic
    information (such as zip code).
</p>

<p>
    We may use this information to personalize our communications to you and to suggest more relevant products
    and services.
</p>

<h6>12. Public Forums</h6>

<p>
    Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums.You should be aware that any information you
    provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your
    personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us. In some cases, we may not be able to
    remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
</p>

<h6>13. Links to other websites</h6>

<p>
    This site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Lingoda is not responsible for the privacy
    practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the
    privacy statements of any website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies
    only to information collected by the Lingoda website.
</p>

<h6>14. Testimonials</h6>

<p>
    We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information. We do
    obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their
    testimonial. If you wish to request to have your testimonial removed you contact our Customer Service.
</p>

<h6>15. Refer a friend</h6>

<p>
    If you decide to refer a friend to our site as part of Lingoda contests or other promotions, we ask you for
    the friend's email address and give you the option of sending them a personal message. Lingoda will
    then send a one-time, automatically generated email message inviting your friend to visit our site. Lingoda
    stores the email address in your personal file solely for the purpose of crediting you if your friend
    becomes a member. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.
</p>

<p>
    We also utilize an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts and other members. We
    make it easy for you to invite people from your email address books to join you on our Site. At your request we
    will search your email address book to help you import your contacts to our site. When we do this, we do not store
    any of your contacts' information our our servers. We may send an email on your behalf to your contacts, but we
    do not keep their email address or any other information until they register for our site themselves.
</p>

<p>
    The Lingoda privacy policy is subject to change. If we decide to change the way we collect, use or share
    information, we will take commercially reasonable steps to notify members by way of an email that explains the
    changes and gives them the choice as to whether or not we may use their information in the new manner. If you
    have any questions about this policy statement, or about any of Easy Language's other policies and practices,
    please contact us.
