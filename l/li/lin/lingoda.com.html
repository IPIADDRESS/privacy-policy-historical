    <p>
    Lingoda GmbH (hereinafter referred to as "Lingoda") has created this privacy statement in
    order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and
    dissemination practices for this web site: Lingoda.com.
</p>

<h6>1. Your Personal Profile</h6>

<p>
    When we ask information of you, our primary interest is to provide you with more personalized service. We
    respect your privacy and do not sell, rent or trade your name or personal details to other organizations except as
    outlined in this policy.
</p>

<h6>2. Security measures</h6>

<p>
    The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to
    protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you
    enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that
    information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
</p>

<p>
    If you ever discover a fraudulent charge from Lingoda on your billing statement, please contact us and
    you must report it immediately to your credit card provider, in accordance with their standard procedures.
</p>

<p>
    This site makes use of forums, bulletin boards and chat rooms. Please remember that any information you
    disclose in these areas becomes public. You should always be cautious about the amount of personal information
    you give to anyone in this context.
</p>

<p>
    We also insist on password verification at sign-in to protect against unauthorized access to your personal profile
    and course history. If you leave the computer unattended without logging out of the site, we log you out
    automatically after some time has passed.
</p>

<p>
    Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are
    granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally
    identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
</p>

<p>
    Despite these security procedures and practices, as is the case with all computer networks connected to the
    Internet, Lingoda cannot guarantee the security of your personal information or any other information
    provided over the Internet and will not be responsible for breaches of security.
</p>

<p>
    No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
    Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>

<h6>3. Communications From The Site</h6>

<p>
    You have the ability to unsubscribe from any email sent from our site at anytime, by simply clicking on the
    unsubscribe link included at the bottom of each email we send.
</p>

<p>
    We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For
    instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.
</p>

<p>
    Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish
    to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.
</p>

<h6>4. Protection of Children’s Information</h6>

<p>
    We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. This and all of our websites are general audience sites
    and not designed or intended to attract children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit
    personal information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13, nor do we send them requests for
    personal information, unless we first obtain permission from that child's parent or legal guardian.
</p>

<h6>5. Membership and Registration for a subscription</h6>

<p>
    Lingoda offers language courses online at competitive prices. To take one of these courses, enjoy a free
    trial or become a user of our community services, you need to become a member of Lingoda. During
    registration we collect information such as your name and email address. We also ask for demographic
    information (such as age and gender) in order for you to create a profile. You may also be asked to supply us with
    credit card information, so that you can pay for the services you request. This information is encrypted on a
    secure server. As a member, you will be added to our mailing list to receive occasional emails about service
    information, special offers, and promotions from Lingoda and other companies within the Easy
    Languages group of companies.
</p>

<h6>6. Access To Personal Information</h6>

<p>
    If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, amend
    or delete your personal information by making the change on our member information page, by contacting our
    Customer Support or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will
    respond to your request to access your personal information within 30 days.
</p>

<p>
    We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will
    retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce
    our agreements. Note that your free account remains active even if your subscription to our paid services has
    expired.
</p>

<h6>7. Changing or Removing Profile Information</h6>

<p>
    <b>Editing your profile.</b> You may change your profile at any time by updating the My Account page. Your changes
    will be updated immediately.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Deleting or deactivating your profile.</b> You may delete or deactivate your profile at any time by contacting

        when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the
        safety of
        others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,
    </li>
    <li>
        if Lingoda is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be
        notified
        via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal
        information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information,
    </li>
    <li>
        to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.
    </li>
</ul>

<h6>9. Cookies</h6>

<p>
    "Cookies" are small pieces of information that we store on your computer's browser or hard drive. We and our
    partners use cookies to remember personal information when you visit our website. For example, if you choose
    the view our site in French we will store that information in your cookie so we can show you our site in French the
    next time you visit. We also use them to store your login ID to make it easier for you to login to our site. Most
    browsers allow you the option of preventing cookies from being stored on your computer, though doing so will
    cause you to lose many of the benefits of Lingoda.
</p>

<p>
    We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your
    browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
</p>

<p>
    We use the service of a third party tracking utility company to track the behavior of visitors to our site. However,
    we do not have access to or control over their cookies. The information we collect through our third party tracking
    utility company is completely anonymous and is used to improve our services and marketing efforts.
</p>

<p>
    As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information
    includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring
    and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to understand
    and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic
    information about our user base as a whole.
</p>

<h6>10. Web Beacons</h6>

<p>
    We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage
    content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique
    identifier,
    similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies,
    which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about
    the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our
    customers’ personally identifiable information.
</p>

<p>
    We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This
    allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing
    campaigns.
</p>

<p>
    In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Lingoda website.
    When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the
    destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics
    and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you
    should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.
</p>

<h6>11. Quizes and Contests</h6>

<p>
    We may provide you the opportunity to participate in quizzes or contests on our site. If you participate, we will
    request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these quizzes and contests is
    completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested
    information typically includes contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic
    information (such as zip code).
</p>

<p>
    We may use this information to personalize our communications to you and to suggest more relevant products
    and services.
</p>

<h6>12. Public Forums</h6>

<p>
    Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums.You should be aware that any information you
    provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your
    personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us. In some cases, we may not be able to
    remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
</p>

<h6>13. Links to other websites</h6>

<p>
    This site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Lingoda is not responsible for the privacy
    practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the
    privacy statements of any website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies
    only to information collected by the Lingoda website.
</p>

<h6>14. Testimonials</h6>

<p>
    We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information. We do
    obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their
    testimonial. If you wish to request to have your testimonial removed you contact our Customer Service.
</p>

<h6>15. Refer a friend</h6>

<p>
    If you decide to refer a friend to our site as part of Lingoda contests or other promotions, we ask you for
    the friend's email address and give you the option of sending them a personal message. Lingoda will
    then send a one-time, automatically generated email message inviting your friend to visit our site. Lingoda
    stores the email address in your personal file solely for the purpose of crediting you if your friend
    becomes a member. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.
</p>

<p>
    We also utilize an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts and other members. We
    make it easy for you to invite people from your email address books to join you on our Site. At your request we
    will search your email address book to help you import your contacts to our site. When we do this, we do not store
    any of your contacts' information our our servers. We may send an email on your behalf to your contacts, but we
    do not keep their email address or any other information until they register for our site themselves.
</p>

<p>
    The Lingoda privacy policy is subject to change. If we decide to change the way we collect, use or share
    information, we will take commercially reasonable steps to notify members by way of an email that explains the
    changes and gives them the choice as to whether or not we may use their information in the new manner. If you
    have any questions about this policy statement, or about any of Easy Language's other policies and practices,
    please contact us.

        Languages.
    </li>

</ul>
<h6>10. Fees and payments</h6>

<p>
    You will be required to register and create an account with Lingoda (the "Account") in order to access certain features
    of the Site and Services. Information gathered through the registration process and information related to your
    account will be subject to these Terms as well as to our "Privacy and Security Policy". You represent and
    warrant that you will not create an Account for anyone other than yourself without permission, that all
    information provided by you when creating an Account is true, accurate and complete, and that you will maintain,
    at all times, true, accurate and complete information related to your Account.
</p>

<p>
    Certain materials and functionalities of the Site are available only through the purchase of an online language class package (the "Package").
    Pursuant to this Agreement you are responsible for any charges associated with connecting to the Site. Lingoda reserves the right to change the Package
    fees in effect or institute new fees at any time, upon reasonable notice posted on the site and emailed to
    current customers.

</p><p>
    By purchasing a Package you agree to be bound to the following terms:
</p>

<h7>Billing Policies</h7>

<p>
    Lingoda fees are exclusive of any applicable VAT or taxes, interest or installment fees charged by the
    credit card company, or other fees associated with connecting to the Internet.
</p>

<p>
    Lingoda guarantees that every credit card transaction you make at Lingoda is 100% secure. If at
    any time you wish to check on the status of your subscription, please login and visit the “My Account” page in
    your Login area.
</p>

<p>
    Your language course contains teacher-led classes. Group classes and private classes are delivered on a "class credit basis", giving
    you access to the stated amount of group classes and private classes that your language course offers. You can always find current prices
    of language courses posted in the checkout pages and occasionally in other pages of our website. The exact contents of your language courses
    are clearly set forth and accessible at all times in the logged-in section of the Site under "My account".
</p>

<p>
    All language course fees are recurring and non-refundable after your purchase. If you do not cancel your language course before the end of the stated course time,
    you agree to the automatic extension of your language course for the same time and the same terms. If you do not wish to continue your language course, you have to
    deactivate your account in the “My Account” page in your login area or give us written (email) notice.
</p>

<p>
    An exception to the prior paragraph is our 7-day money back guarantee when stated explicitly on the checkout page. Within 7 days after purchase you have the right to cancel
    your language course by written (email) notice and receive your full money back.
</p>

<p>
    In addition to the classes included in your language course, you can purchase additional classes. These classes give you the right to take more
    teacher-led classes. Additional classes, whether group or private, those sessions are delivered on a
    “class credit basis” over a period of 6 months, this means that if you haven’t used those sessions by the end of
    6 months after purchasing the class package, those unused sessions are lost to you and will not be refunded.
</p><p>

    <h7>Free trial</h7>

</p><p>
    The free trial is available only to first-time users.
</p>

<h7>Credit card payments</h7>

<p>
    After initial enrollment, if your credit card expires, is cancelled, is lost, or rendered invalid, your
    subscription is in danger of termination. You will be contacted and given the opportunity to change your
    registration data. If your credit card is not successfully recharged and you are not renewed successfully, your
    subscription will be terminated.
</p>

<h6>11. Indemnification</h6>

<p>
    You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Lingoda and its affiliates, partners, suppliers, and
    employees from any and all liability, claims, costs, or damages arising from your use of the Site or your breach
    of this Agreement and any of the Terms set out herein.
</p>

<h6>12. Miscellaneous</h6>

<p>
    If any portion of this Agreement is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of
    competent jurisdiction, this Agreement as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only
    that portion of this Agreement that is unlawful, void or unenforceable shall be stricken from this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
    You agree that if Lingoda does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
    the Agreement (or which Lingoda has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to
    be a formal waiver of Lingoda’ rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Lingoda.
</p>

<p>
    All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall survive your acceptance
    of this Agreement and the termination of this Agreement.

    <p>
    Lingoda GmbH (hereinafter referred to as "Lingoda") has created this privacy statement in
    order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and
    dissemination practices for this web site: Lingoda.com.
</p>

</ul>

<h6>1. Your Personal Profile</h6>

<p>
    When we ask information of you, our primary interest is to provide you with more personalized service. We
    respect your privacy and do not sell, rent or trade your name or personal details to other organizations except as
    outlined in this policy.
</p>

<h6>2. Security measures</h6>

<p>
    The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to
    protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you
    enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that
    information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
</p>

<p>
    If you ever discover a fraudulent charge from Lingoda on your billing statement, please contact us and
    you must report it immediately to your credit card provider, in accordance with their standard procedures.
</p>

<p>
    This site makes use of forums, bulletin boards and chat rooms. Please remember that any information you
    disclose in these areas becomes public. You should always be cautious about the amount of personal information
    you give to anyone in this context.
</p>

<p>
    We also insist on password verification at sign-in to protect against unauthorized access to your personal profile
    and course history. If you leave the computer unattended without logging out of the site, we log you out
    automatically after some time has passed.
</p>

<p>
    Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are
    granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally
    identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
</p>

<p>
    Despite these security procedures and practices, as is the case with all computer networks connected to the
    Internet, Lingoda cannot guarantee the security of your personal information or any other information
    provided over the Internet and will not be responsible for breaches of security.
</p>

<p>
    No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
    Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>

<h6>3. Communications From The Site</h6>

<p>
    You have the ability to unsubscribe from any email sent from our site at anytime, by simply clicking on the
    unsubscribe link included at the bottom of each email we send.
</p>

<p>
    We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For
    instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.
</p>

<p>
    Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish
    to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.
</p>

<h6>4. Protection of Children’s Information</h6>

<p>
    We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. This and all of our websites are general audience sites
    and not designed or intended to attract children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit
    personal information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13, nor do we send them requests for
    personal information, unless we first obtain permission from that child's parent or legal guardian.
</p>

<h6>5. Membership and Registration for a subscription</h6>

    trial or become a user of our community services, you need to become a member of Lingoda. During
    registration we collect information such as your name and email address. We also ask for demographic
    information (such as age and gender) in order for you to create a profile. You may also be asked to supply us with
    credit card information, so that you can pay for the services you request. This information is encrypted on a
    secure server. As a member, you will be added to our mailing list to receive occasional emails about service
    information, special offers, and promotions from Lingoda and other companies within the Easy
    Languages group of companies.
</p>

    retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce
    our agreements. Note that your free account remains active even if your subscription to our paid services has
    expired.

</p>

<h6>8. Who We Share Your Information With</h6>
<ul>
    <li>
        We share your personal information with other companies within the Lingoda group of companies so that
        these companies can market their products or services to you. For a complete picture of what Lingoda
        Products and Services are available, please visit www.lingoda.com. The only information we share with
        other companies within the Lingoda group of companies is your name, age group, email address, and
        country. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact our Customer
        Service team.
    </li>
    <li>
        We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business
        activities such as processing your payment or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use
        your personal information <i>only as necessary to provide </i> these services to us
    </li>
    <li>
        We may also disclose your personal information
    </li>
    <li>
        as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process
    </li>
    <li>
        when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the
        safety of
        others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,
    </li>
    <li>
        if Lingoda is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be
        notified
        via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal
        information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information,
    </li>
    <li>
        to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.
    </li>
</ul>

<h6>9. Cookies</h6>

<p>
    "Cookies" are small pieces of information that we store on your computer's browser or hard drive. We and our
    partners use cookies to remember personal information when you visit our website. For example, if you choose
    the view our site in French we will store that information in your cookie so we can show you our site in French the
    next time you visit. We also use them to store your login ID to make it easier for you to login to our site. Most
    browsers allow you the option of preventing cookies from being stored on your computer, though doing so will
    cause you to lose many of the benefits of Lingoda.
</p>

<p>
    We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your
    browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
</p>

<p>
    We use the service of a third party tracking utility company to track the behavior of visitors to our site. However,
    we do not have access to or control over their cookies. The information we collect through our third party tracking
    utility company is completely anonymous and is used to improve our services and marketing efforts.
</p>

<p>
    As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information
    includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring
    and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to understand
    and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic
    information about our user base as a whole.
</p>

<h6>10. Web Beacons</h6>

<p>
    We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage
    content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique
    identifier,
    similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies,
    which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about
    the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our
    customers’ personally identifiable information.
</p>

<p>
    We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This
    allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing
    campaigns.
</p>

<p>
    In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Lingoda website.
    When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the
    destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics
    and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you
    should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.
</p>

<h6>11. Quizes and Contests</h6>

<p>
    We may provide you the opportunity to participate in quizzes or contests on our site. If you participate, we will
    request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these quizzes and contests is
    completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested
    information typically includes contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic
    information (such as zip code).
</p>

<p>
    We may use this information to personalize our communications to you and to suggest more relevant products
    and services.
</p>

<h6>12. Public Forums</h6>

<p>
    Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums.You should be aware that any information you
    provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your
    personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us. In some cases, we may not be able to
    remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
</p>

<h6>13. Links to other websites</h6>

<p>
    This site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Lingoda is not responsible for the privacy
    practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the
    privacy statements of any website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies
    only to information collected by the Lingoda website.
</p>

<h6>14. Testimonials</h6>

<p>
    We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information. We do
    obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their
    testimonial. If you wish to request to have your testimonial removed you contact our Customer Service.
</p>

<h6>15. Refer a friend</h6>

<p>
    If you decide to refer a friend to our site as part of Lingoda contests or other promotions, we ask you for
    the friend's email address and give you the option of sending them a personal message. Lingoda will
    then send a one-time, automatically generated email message inviting your friend to visit our site. Lingoda
    stores the email address in your personal file solely for the purpose of crediting you if your friend
    becomes a member. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.
</p>

<p>
    We also utilize an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts and other members. We
    make it easy for you to invite people from your email address books to join you on our Site. At your request we
    will search your email address book to help you import your contacts to our site. When we do this, we do not store
    any of your contacts' information our our servers. We may send an email on your behalf to your contacts, but we
    do not keep their email address or any other information until they register for our site themselves.
</p>

<p>
    The Lingoda privacy policy is subject to change. If we decide to change the way we collect, use or share
    information, we will take commercially reasonable steps to notify members by way of an email that explains the
    changes and gives them the choice as to whether or not we may use their information in the new manner. If you
    have any questions about this policy statement, or about any of Easy Language's other policies and practices,
    please contact us.
