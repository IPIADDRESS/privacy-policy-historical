							<li>Our legitimate business interest, including but not limited to the following circumstances where collecting or using Personal Data is necessary for:
								<ul>
									<li>Intra-company transfers for client data for administrative purposes;</li>
									<li>Product development and enhancement, where the processing enables Linux Academy to enhance, modify, personalize, or otherwise improve our services and communications for the benefit of our customers, and to better understand how people interact with our Sites;</li>
									<li>Communications and marketing, including processing data for direct marketing purposes, and subject to your opt-in for these purposes, and to determine the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and advertising;</li>

								</ul>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Provided that, in each circumstance, we will weigh the necessity of our processing for the purpose against your privacy and confidentiality interests, including taking into account your reasonable expectations, the impact of processing, and any safeguards which are or could be put in place. In all circumstances, we will limit such processing for our legitimate business interest to what is necessary for its purposes.</p>

						<h4 id="InformationShare">Information We Share</h4>
						<p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of the Company unless one of the following circumstances applies:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>With your consent</strong>. We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Linux Academy when we have your consent to do so.</li>
							<li><strong>For external processing</strong>. We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or partners to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These third parties include: Hubspot, GA, Intercom, Olark, Mailchip, SurveyMonkey, Google, Type Form, VWO, Sendgrid, and Zendesk. We do not share personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes.</li>
							<li><strong>For Legal Reasons</strong>. We will share Personal Data with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Linux Academy if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
								<ul>
									<li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</li>
									<li>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</li>
									<li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li>
									<li>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Linux Academy, our Users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>. As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, sell, or share assets in connection with, for example, a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy.  In such transactions, Personal Data about our users is often a transferred business asset.  In the event that Linux Academy itself or substantially all of our assets are acquired, Personal Data about our users may be one of the transferred assets.</li>
							<li><strong>Aggregate Site Use Information</strong>. We may share aggregate and anonymized/pseudonymized Personal Data to advertisers and other third parties in order to promote or describe use of the Sites.</li>

						<h4 id="FailureToProvideData">Your Failure to Provide Personal Data</h4>
						<p>Your provision of Personal Data is required in order to use certain parts of our services and our products.  If you fail to provide such Personal Data, you may not be able to access and use our services and/or our products, or parts of our services and/or our products. </p>

						<h4 id="RetentionData">Our Retention of Your Personal Data</h4>
						<p>We may retain your Personal Data for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection.  For example, we keep your Personal Data for no longer than reasonably necessary for your use of our products and services and for a reasonable period of time afterward.  We also may retain your Personal Data during the period of time needed for us to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p>

						<h4 id="ChoicesWithData">Your Choices and Accessing, Updating or Deleting Your Personal Data</h4>
						<p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with choices about how we use your personal data. We also aim to provide you with access to your Personal Data. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. Subject to applicable law, you may obtain a copy of personal information we maintain about you or you may update or correct inaccuracies in that information through your Linux Academy account at <a href="/">www.linuxacademy.com</a>, or by contacting us. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the information. In addition, if you believe that personal information we maintain about you is inaccurate, subject to applicable law, you may have the right to request that we correct or amend the information by contacting us as indicated in the How to Contact Us section below.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p><strong>European Users’ Rights With Respect to Personal Data</strong></p>
								<p>Some data protection laws, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), provide you with certain rights in connection with Personal Data you have shared with us. If you are resident in the European Economic Area, you may have the following rights:</p>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>The right to be informed</strong>. You are entitled to be informed of the use of your Personal Data.  This Privacy Policy provides such information to you.</li>
									<li><strong>The right of access</strong>. You have the right to request a copy of your Personal Data which we hold about you.</li>
									<li><strong>The right of correction</strong>: You have the right to request correction or changes of your Personal Data if it is found to be inaccurate or out of date.  </li>
									<li><strong>The right to be forgotten</strong>: You have the right to request us, at any time, to delete your Personal Data from our servers and to erase your Personal Data when it is no longer necessary for us to retain such data.  Note, however, that deletion of your Personal Data will likely impact your ability to use our services.</li>
									<li><strong>The right to object (opt-out)</strong>: You have the right to opt-out of certain uses of your Personal Data, such as direct marketing, at any time. </li>
									<li><strong>The right to data portability</strong>: You have the right to a “portable” copy of your Personal Data that you have submitted to us.  Generally, this means your right to request that we move, copy or transmit your Personal Data stored on our servers / IT environment to another service provider’s servers / IT environment.</li>
									<li><strong>The right to refuse to be subjected to automated decision making, including profiling</strong>: You have the right not to be subject to a decision and insist on human intervention if the decision is based on automated processing and produces a legal effect or a similarly significant effect on you.</li>
									<li><strong>The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</strong></li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Changing or Deleting Your Information</strong></p>
								<p>You may update or correct information about yourself by emailing us at <a href="mailtto:support@linuxacademy.com">support@linuxacademy.com</a>.  If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated.  We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law, to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements or for other legitimate business purposes. </p>
								<p>We may contact you to request that you update your Personal Data on a regular basis to ensure its integrity for the purposes of ongoing data management.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h4 id="OptInOutPolicy">Our Opt-in/Opt-out Policy</h4>
						<p>By providing an email address on the Linux Academy Sites, you agree that we may contact you in the event of a change in this Privacy Policy, to provide you with any service related notices, or to provide you with information about our events, invitations, or related educational information.</p>
						<p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “opt-in” is generally defined as any affirmative action by a user to submit or receive information, as the case may be.</p>
						<p>We currently provide the following opt-out opportunities:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>At any time, you can follow a link provided in offers, newsletters or other email messages (except for e-commerce confirmation or service notice emails) received from us to unsubscribe. 	</li>
							<li>At any time, you can contact us through <a href="mailto:support@linuxacademy.com">support@linuxacademy.com</a> or the address or telephone number provided below to unsubscribe from the service and opt-out of our right per your consent under the terms of this Privacy Policy to share your Personal Data. </li>
						</ol>
						<p>Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, please note that we always reserve the right to contact you in the event of a change in this Privacy Policy, or to provide you with any service related notices.</p>

						<h4 id="ThirdPartyLinks">Third Party Links</h4>
						<p>The Sites may contain links to web-pages operated by parties other than Linux Academy. We do not control such websites and are not responsible for their contents or the privacy policies or other practices of such websites. Our inclusion of links to such websites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such websites or any association with their operators. Further, it is up to the User to take precautions to ensure that whatever links the User selects or software the User downloads (whether from this Site or other websites) is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses, defects and other items of a destructive nature. These websites and services may have their own privacy policies, which the User will be subject to upon linking to the third party's website. Linux Academy strongly recommends that each User review the third party's terms and policies.</p>

						<h4 id="International">International Transfer</h4>
						<p>We are committed to complying with applicable laws, regulations and mandatory government standards regarding the protection of Personal Data. </p>
						<p>Since we are a global organization, Personal Data and any additional information submitted may be used globally in connection with employment, business processes within Linux Academy, or communicating with our clients. Therefore, Personal Data may be transferred to other Linux Academy entities worldwide, where it will be processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and laws that are applicable in each country.</p>
						<p>If we transfer your Personal Data out of your jurisdiction, we will implement suitable safeguards to ensure that your Personal Data is protected.  We are soon to be certified to the EU-US Privacy Shield and it is our policy to, where required by applicable laws, execute a Data Privacy &amp; Data Security Addendum with all third parties with whom we may share Personal Data.</p>

						<h4 id="ProtectPersonalData">How We Protect Personal Data</h4>
						<p>Linux Academy maintains administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the User's Personal Data and information against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account technological reality, cost, the scope, context and purposes of processing weighted against the severity and likelihood that the processing could threaten individual rights and freedoms.  For example, we use commercially reasonable security measures such as encryption, firewalls, and transport layer security (TLS) or hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) to protect Personal Data.</p>
						<p>If Linux Academy collects account information for payment or credit, Linux Academy will use the information only to complete the task for which the account information was offered.</p>

						<h4 id="Children">Children</h4>
						<p>The Site is not intended for use by children.  We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 13.  If a child has provided us with Personal Data, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us to have the information deleted from our records. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us at hunter@linuxacademy.com. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.</p>
						
						<h4 id="DoNotTrack">“Do Not Track” Signals</h4>
						<p>Linux Academy does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser may include controls to block and delete cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, to allow you to opt out of data collection through those technologies.</p>
						<p>California residents are entitled to contact us to request information about whether we have disclosed personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  We do not disclose personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing us at the address listed in the “How to Contact Us” section.</p>

						<h4 id="ChangesPrivacyPolicy">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
						<p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services or products, email notification or privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.</p>
