                        In most cases our processing of your personal information for marketing purposes is based on our legitimate interests, although in some cases (such as where required by applicable laws or where we use or process any of your Sensitive Personal information or Sensitive Data) it may be based on your explicit consent.

                    <p>
                        We do not conduct any automated decision-making on your personal information. We may use limited profiling or other forms of automated processing for:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            security purposes only to assess if your account may be fraudulent, a spam account or suspect in any way;

                    <p>
                        As profiling uses automated processing, it is sometimes connected with automated decision making. Not all profiling results in automated decision making, but it can do.

                        Please note, you have certain rights (including a right to object) in respect of automated decision making, where that decision has significant effects on you, including where it produces a legal effect on you.  See below for more information about your rights.

                        There are some circumstances in which we are not required to give you access to your personal information. We may reject requests that are unlawful, frivolous, vexatious, unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing existing practices), that we believe risk the privacy, health or safety of others, or would be otherwise be extremely impractical (for example requests concerning information on our backup systems or unique ID data on Users).
