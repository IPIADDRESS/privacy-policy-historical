<hr noshade="noshade" size="1">LinkShare Limited (“LinkShare” or “we” or “us”) uses this website, <a href="" title="">www.linkshare.co.uk</a>, to promote or operate our families of advertising services.&nbsp; The word “our” is a possessive pronoun referring to LinkShare.
<p> </p>
<p>While  certain areas of this website may be accessed and viewed by members of  the public, not all visitors to this website may use our networks.&nbsp;  Each LinkShare network is available for use only by persons or entities  that join that network as either an “Advertiser” or a “Publisher.” </p>
<p>Only persons or entities that operate websites through which they conduct a business are eligible to become Advertisers.&nbsp;  Publishers must be corporations or other legal entities or adults (at  least of the legal age to be able to enter into contracts in the  jurisdiction in which they reside) that also manage or operate websites  which they use to conduct a business or generate revenues.&nbsp;  In order to become an Advertiser or Publisher, a person or entity must  apply for membership and have the application accepted by LinkShare,  which includes accepting certain contractual terms.</p>
<h2><span class="text">Information Collected from Visitors to this Website</span></h2>
<p>We  gather standard information that accompanies Internet transmissions,  which in some jurisdictions is personally-identifiable information.&nbsp; Other than this information, we do not gather personally-identifiable&nbsp;  information about or from visitors to or users of this website solely  as a result of such visits or usage, other than from (i) people  requesting to be contacted with more information about LinkShare  offerings, (ii) persons or entities whom we allow to join a network as  an Advertiser pursuant to a written contract that we and the Advertiser  sign and physically deliver (an “Advertiser Agreement”) and (iii)  persons or entities whom we allow to join a network as a Publisher  pursuant to either a written contract that we and the Publisher sign and  physically deliver or an “online” contract that the Publisher can  review on the Publisher registration page on this website and agree to  by clicking on a button on that page (a “Publisher Agreement”). We use  the personally-identifiable information submitted with inquiries about  LinkShare’s offerings to respond to those inquiries.</p>
<p>Our  servers log the standard information that accompanies Internet  transmissions, like the date and time of a visit, browser type, IP  address, domain names, access dates and times, referring website  addresses and operating system.&nbsp;  We use the services of a third party to analyze information about how  visitors use our website. This third party uses web tracking technology  such as, but not limited to, cookies, Javascript and/or other kinds of  Web beacons. We have no control over this third party’s tracking  devices.&nbsp; We receive only  aggregated, non-personally-identifiable information generated by this  tracking technology. LinkShare may store cookies on a visitor’s computer  in order to manage a visitor’s session on our site. By accessing our  site, you agree that LinkShare may place cookies on your computer and  our third party may use web tracking technology, in each case, as  described above. You may opt-out of receiving cookies by adjusting your  web browser settings to reject cookies. If you reject cookies, you may  not be able to take full advantage of all of the features of our site,  including “signing in” to password protected areas. A detailed summary  of cookies can be found below under “Data about Customers of Advertisers  and Publishers.”</p>
<p>Our  networks are membership-based, and members must enter into a legal  contract with LinkShare in order to join and use our networks.&nbsp;  Each of our contracts with Advertisers and Publishers contains terms  that set forth the obligations of LinkShare with respect to the use and  disclosure of the information that we gather from our Advertisers and  Publishers.&nbsp; Advertisers and Publishers should refer to those terms and not to this Privacy Policy. </p>
<h2><span class="text">Children’s Information </span></h2>
<p><span class="text">We believe it is important to provide added protection for children online.&nbsp;  We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their  children to participate in and monitor their online activity.&nbsp; LinkShare does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.&nbsp;  If a parent or guardian believes that LinkShare has in its database the  personally-identifiable information of a child under the age of 13,  please contact privacy@linkshare.com and we will use our best efforts to  remove the information from our records.</span></p>
<h2><span class="text">Information about Advertisers </span></h2>
<h2><span class="text"></span></h2>
<p>We use a “template” form of contract to enroll Advertisers.&nbsp;  That template changes from time to time. that we publish on this  website that are accessible only by Advertisers or prospective  Advertisers to whom we grant access. We do not publish our template  Advertiser Agreement on this website or make the incorporated network  policies that are posted on this website available to the public.&nbsp;  We do provide the template and access to the incorporated network  policies to prospective Advertisers with whom we are interested in  pursuing a network relationship. Each such prospective Advertiser is  encouraged, and has the opportunity, to review the template and any  incorporated policies, including the terms that define the respective  obligations of LinkShare and the Advertiser regarding use and disclosure  of confidential information and privacy. </p>
<p>LinkShare’s  rights and obligations with respect to the disclosure and use of the  information we gather about any Advertiser are governed by the  Advertiser Agreement that we and the Advertiser sign. </p>
<h2><span class="text"> Information about Publishers</span></h2>
<h2><span class="text"></span></h2>In  order to join a network as a Publisher, a person or entity has to apply  for membership by completing an “online” application on this website.&nbsp;  The online application requires personally identifiable information  about the applicant. The application form may be viewed by clicking on  the Publisher registration page of this website. Besides the information  that we gather by means of the online application, we may obtain a  great deal of personally- identifiable information about a Publisher  through a variety of online or offline means.&nbsp;  That information includes the Publisher’s contact information, Taxpayer  Identification Number (which may be an individual’s Social Security  Number) and VAT registration numbers (for non-U.S. networks), as well as  information about the business conducted by the Publisher on its  website related to the use of our networks, including information about  the online marketing strategies and plans and the kinds and volumes of  transactions conducted through our networks generally and with specific  Advertisers. We may use third party vendors to authenticate and/or  supplement the information a Publisher applicant submits.
<p>LinkShare’s  rights and obligations with respect to the disclosure and use of the  information we gather about any Publisher are governed by the Publisher  Agreement that we enter into with that Publisher. Usually, that  Publisher Agreement is an “online” form that, as a condition to joining  any of our networks, we require each Publisher to accept by clicking on a  button on the Publisher registration page of our website used for the  particular network. In a few special cases, the Publisher Agreement may  be a paper document that is manually signed and physically delivered. </p>
<p>We  post on the Publisher registration pages of this website our “template”  form of contract by which we enroll Publishers. That template changes  from time to time and may incorporate policies that we also publish on  this website. Each prospective Publisher is encouraged, and has the  opportunity, to review the template and any incorporated network  policies, including their terms that define the respective obligations  of LinkShare and the Publisher regarding use and disclosure of  confidential information and privacy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>All  applications for membership as a Publisher are subject to LinkShare’s  acceptance. If we do not accept an application, then we may (but have no  obligation to) retain the information that the applicant provided in  the online application.&nbsp;  Retention of such information may be restricted under applicable laws,  and we will delete information in accordance with these laws.&nbsp; We will not disclose this information to third parties except as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>We  may disclose it to government agencies or officials or other third  parties if we believe such disclosure to be required or compelled under  applicable law or regulations or legal process. </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>We  may disclose it to government agencies or officials upon their request,  even if not compelled by a subpoena or other legal process, and without  any duty on our part to independently confirm that such agencies or  officials are legally entitled to such disclosure. </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>In  the event that LinkShare sells or transfers ownership, operation or  control of any or all of its Networks or engages any subcontractor or  agent to operate any Network or provide any service related to any  Network, LinkShare reserves the right to transfer or disclose all or any  part of its data to the buyer, subcontractor or agent. </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>In  the event that LinkShare is acquired by or merged with a third party  entity, or in the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of  creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting  creditors’ rights generally, we reserve the right, in any of these  circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected  as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. </li></ul>
<p>If  we accept an application for membership in a network as a Publisher, we  do retain the information that the applicant provided in the online  application. We may also obtain other information about our Publishers  during the course of their usage of our networks, including, but not  limited to, information about the volumes of business they conduct  through the Network with Advertisers or others. We may, but are not  obligated to, retain the information that we obtain about any Publisher  after that Publisher leaves the Network. </p>
<p>We  may use and disclose the information we have or acquire about any  Publisher as provided in the Publisher Agreement, which such Publisher  enters into with LinkShare. The template form of Publisher Agreement  gives LinkShare broad discretion in using and sharing the information  that Publishers provide to us, including the right to furnish any or all  of that information to Advertisers or other third parties. LinkShare is  not responsible or liable for any use or disclosure by any Advertiser  or other third party of information about any Publisher that we furnish.  </p>
<p>Some of the services we offer allow a Publisher to enter into a direct business relationship with an Advertiser.&nbsp;  For example, if an Advertiser engages us to manage its affiliate  marketing program through our affiliate marketing network, the  Advertiser will have the ability to make a general offer to all  Publishers in the affiliate marketing network, and Publishers will have  the ability to apply directly to the Advertiser's affiliate marketing  program.&nbsp; In order to  participate in that Advertiser's affiliate marketing program, each  Publisher must separately apply to join that program and then must be  accepted into that program by the relevant Advertiser. An Advertiser may  require a Publisher applying to or participating in its program to  provide information directly to the Advertiser.&nbsp;  Any Advertiser’s use of Publisher data, however obtained, is governed  by that Advertiser’s own contract, if any, with that Publisher and by  its own privacy policies, if any. LinkShare is not responsible or liable  for any use or disclosure of any such information by the Advertiser or  any third party. If the Advertiser provides LinkShare with any data  about any Publisher, then that Advertiser is solely responsible for  ensuring that its provision to us is consistent with that Advertiser’s  own privacy policy, own contract with such Publisher, applicable legal  requirements of other obligations or commitments of such Advertiser to  such Publisher. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,  LinkShare expressly disclaims any obligation or liability to any  Publisher with regard to any use, storage, processing or disclosure of  any data about that Publisher that LinkShare obtains from any Advertiser  or any third party. <br>
          </p>
<h2><span class="text"> Data about Customers of Advertisers and Publishers</span></h2>
<p><span class="text">In  providing our affiliate marketing, search management and related  services, LinkShare does not deal directly with the customers of  Advertisers or Publishers. We enable Advertisers and Publishers to  create links between their own websites. A visitor who clicks on an  Advertiser’s banner or other promotion on a Publisher’s website is  redirected, through our website, to the Advertiser’s website, where he  or she may purchase a product or service or engage in another  transaction or activity that entitles the Publisher to compensation from  the Advertiser. As a result of such redirection through our website,  our technology automatically records the IP (Internet Protocol) address  of the browser used. In addition, during such redirection, we may place  one or more “cookies” on the hard drive of the visitor’s computer  through his or her Web browser. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers  that enable the systems used by the website operator who places the  cookie to recognize the visitor’s browser. In connection with certain  features of our services to Advertisers, we use cookies in order to  determine whether and when a “cookied” Web browser is used to return to  the Advertiser’s site after a prior visit. The cookies we currently use  permit us to determine when a browser is used to make repeat visits or  clickthroughs to a website and to determine whether the same browser has  accessed more than one site on our network, but do not permit us to  determine the identity of any user of that browser or gather any other  personally-identifiable information about that user, such as postal  address, email address, phone number, social security number or any  credit card number.

<p><span class="text">In  order to provide reports to an Advertiser and the Publishers in its  Publisher program conducted through one of our networks, we need basic  data about the kinds and volumes of Web user activities that occur as a  result of the links created through that network, but we do not need  data that identifies or permits the identification of any customers or  website visitors of an Advertiser or Publisher.&nbsp;  We do not intentionally obtain any personally-identifiable data about  any of such customers or visitors through our technology or services,  unless the Advertiser or a Publisher elects to furnish it to us or  authorizes us to obtain that data. Our rights and obligations with  regard to that information, therefore, are solely defined by our  contract with that Advertiser or Publisher.&nbsp;  We do not, through this Privacy Policy or otherwise, make any promise  or undertake any obligation directly to any user of any Advertiser’s or  Publisher’s website with regard to any use or disclosure of information  that a user furnishes directly to any Advertiser or Publisher.&nbsp;  Each Advertiser and Publisher is solely responsible for establishing  its own privacy policy, communicating that policy to the users of its  website and ensuring that any access to, processing, storage and use by  LinkShare, in accordance with the applicable Advertiser Agreement or  Publisher Agreement, of any data about those users are consistent with  that Advertiser’s or Publisher’s own privacy policy, applicable legal  requirements of other obligations or commitments to such users.&nbsp;  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, LinkShare expressly  disclaims any obligation or liability to any user of any Advertiser’s or  Publisher’s website of any nature, including with regard to any data  about that user that LinkShare obtains, processes, stores, uses or  discloses. <br>
                        </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Lead Generation</h2>LinkShare  may employ a number of different methods to generate leads on behalf of  its Advertisers, including publishing it own Websites to promote the  products and services of Advertisers ("Proprietary Sites").&nbsp;  Some of our Proprietary Sites may host Web forms that can be used by  visitors to or users of that site to request that they be contacted with  more information about an Advertiser or category of Advertisers  promoted on that site.&nbsp; Each  Proprietary Site is managed separately from this site and will have a  separate privacy policy that will govern the use and collection of  information on that site. <br>

<h2>Security</h2>We  have implemented reasonable security measures in order to protect  information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,  alteration or destruction.&nbsp; These include firewalls, data encryption redundancy and intrusion detection. &nbsp;<br>
       Our employees are made aware of and are accountable for compliance with these procedures.&nbsp; Please note, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.&nbsp;  As a result, although we strive to protect your information, we cannot  ensure or warrant the security of your information against any possible  loss or unauthorized access.
<h2>Your California Privacy Rights </h2>
<p>California  Law permits our customers who are California residents to request  certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to  third parties for their direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; To make such a request, please contact us by email, <a href="mailto:privacy@linkshare.com" title="">privacy@linkshare.com</a> or write to us at the address listed under Contact Information.</p>
<h2> Transfers from the EU </h2>
<p>  If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws  governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law,  including those whose privacy laws may be more strict than U.S. law,  please note that you are transferring your personal information to the  United States to LinkShare.&nbsp; You  may revoke this consent at any time by contacting LinkShare at the  address indicated below, although this may require LinkShare to restrict  your use of the Site.</p>
<h2> Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>  LinkShare reserves the right to change or replace this Privacy Policy  at any time and from time to time. Any changes or replacement will be  noted through indications on this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;  If we have a way to do so, and your consent to do so, LinkShare will  contact you by email in the event this privacy policy is materially  changed.&nbsp; You will be deemed to  have been made aware of, and will be subject to, the changes to the  Privacy Policy after such notice has been posted with the following  exception: if at the time you provide personal information to LinkShare  you limit how such information will be used to communicate with you,  either by LinkShare or by third parties, LinkShare will not change your  preference in this regard without your express consent.</p>
<p>In  the event that LinkShare sells or transfers ownership, operation or  control of any or all of its Networks is acquired by or merged with a  third party entity, or in the unlikely event of our bankruptcy,  insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit  of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles  affecting creditors’ rights generally, we reserve the right, in any of  these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have  collected as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of  control. You agree that LinkShare may provide to such entity information  that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged  with the other entity without obtaining your further consent.&nbsp;  Any entity acquiring assets comprising or consisting of your  information shall agree to handle such information in accordance with  the terms of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;  In this event, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you before  information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different  privacy policy. </p>
<h2> Questions and Comments about Our Privacy Policy/Removal or Correction of Information</h2>
<p>  Persons already enrolled as an Advertiser in one of our Networks who  have questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or the relevant  provisions of their Advertiser Agreements should contact their  Advertiser Services representatives. Prospective Advertisers should  contact their LinkShare client development manager to discuss any such  questions or comments. </p>
