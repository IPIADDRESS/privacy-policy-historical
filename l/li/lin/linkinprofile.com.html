Your privacy is super important to us, so we wrote our Privacy Policy so you could understand it. However, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to our legal team at legal@linkinprofile.com.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Link in Profile is designed for you to turn your Instagram followers into your Esty shoppers, blog readers, Shopify customers or website viewers. We do this by linking your Instagram account with our own servers and analyzing the media you post to Instagram. With a Link in Profile account, any media that you post with a URL in the caption will be posted to your Link in Profile landing page. Because of this, your privacy is very important to us. We work extremely hard at all times to maintain your prevent unauthorized access to your data. We think you should control who your data is shared with, not us. To that end, we’ve developed this Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect, use, disclose, transfer and store your information when you use our service or software. Please take a moment to review this policy and do not hesitate to contact us with any questions via the email address included at the top and bottom of this page.</p><h3>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h3><p>Personal information is defined as data that can be used to identify you, and possibly contact you. At Link in Profile, we maintain strict standards when we work with personal information.</p><p>When you use Link in Profile, your Instagram account is used to create a dedicated landing page referencing your account name and account profile picture. This may have the ability to identify you to the outside world, so we allow for your account name to be changed should you want to. However, we want the user accessing you Link in Profile landing page to know where they came from, your Instagram account, and where they are going, your destination on the web. For that reason we suggest keeping your Instagram profile picture and name the same in both services.</p><p>We also collect the images you post on Instagram and analyze them for URLs located in the caption. We do not store these images on our servers, but do temporarily store the captions to faciliate our analysis. Once we know there is a URL in the image, we then create a dedicated object on your Link in Profile page with that image and URL. If you do not wish for that image to remain on your Link in Profile landing page, simply remove the URL from the caption.</p><p>If you have a private Instagram account, be very careful how you use our service. We do not want you to be displaying any images that you do not wish to be made public (your dedicated Link in Profile page is publically accessible and does not have any access restrictions). When in doubt, email us to discuss any issues you may have.</p><p><strong>If you find any abuse within Link in Profile, please reach out immediately to us at legal@linkinprofile.com.</strong></p><p>When you use Link in Profile, we may ask you for information such as your name, phone number or email address. The information we collect allows us to provide customer support and assist you in the use of Link in Profile. We may also use your personal information to contact you about important notices, such as changes to our terms, conditions and policies. Again, we encourage you to pause and reflect on the information you give us.</p><p>As always, your privacy is paramount to Link in Profile. We will never disclose your personal information without your consent.</p><h3>Collection of Usage Information on the Server Side</h3><p>To provide better security and troubleshoot errors, we log the underlying HTTP communications of Link in Profile. This log has the potential to include personally identifiable information; as such, we treat the information as highly confidential.</p><h3>Collection and Use of Non-personal Information</h3><p>We may also collect non-personal information, which is defined as data in a form that does not permit a direct association with any specific individual. Our use of non-personal information is limited by the agreements that we enter into with you when you activate a Link in Profile account. We follow strict guidelines to ensure the data is truly non-personal including internal review and oversight.</p><p>Non-personal information allows us to improve Link in Profile, provide specific benefits to Link in Profile users, and benefit the Link in Profile community as a whole. For example, we may use non-personal information to track access patterns to better understand usage and generally improve the service. In any situation that we disclose non-personal information, it is because we deem it to be beneficial to Link in Profile users.</p><p>It is important to note that if we ever combine personal information with non-personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information and never disclose it to anyone without your explicit written consent.</p><h3>Other Disclosure</h3><p>It may be necessary – by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence – for us to disclose your personal information. In such instances, we will do everything in our power to notify you of such request in writing, and allow for you to interject yourself into the disclosure of such information.</p><h3>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3><p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to keep you logged in to the software and to identify usage behavior to improve our services.</p><h3>Protection of Personal Information</h3><p>We take many precautions to protect your data, through technological, administrative and physical means. When the Link in Profile team works with personal information directly related to a user’s account, they exercise strict security measures.</p><h3>California Privacy Rights</h3><p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 and Business and Professions Code Section 22575 permits users who are California residents to request that Link in Profile not share their personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. We assume that you do not want us to share your information for direct marketing purposes and therefore will not do so, even without any action on your part. However, if you would still like to make such a request, send an email with “California Privacy” in the subject line to the email address specified in “Contact Information,” below.</p><h3>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h3><p>Link in Profile is not directed to children, nor do we knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age Link in Profile. If we learn that we have collected personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age, we will delete the information.</p><h3>Notification of Privacy Statement Changes</h3><p>We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices.

We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p><h3>Contact Information</h3><p>If you have any questions or comments in relation to this Privacy Policy, please contact: legal@linkinprofile.com</p></article><footer><a href="/">Home</a><a href="/about/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a></footer><script async="" src="//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js"></script><script src="/assets/landing-cd783db9796b07d2a5fd4494131457e87a81693139604b02c14d0a7c27c5aaf5.js" data-turbolinks-track="true"></script><script>
