<h2>SSC Privacy Statement</h2>
</center>
<p>
Specialized Systems Consultants, Inc (SSC), recognizes the importance of 
protecting the privacy of information provided by visitors to our web sites. 
We have created the following data collection policies to demonstrate our 
commitment to the issue of privacy.
</p><p>
<b>Web Site User Information Collected by SSC</b>
<br>
SSC collects information about users during their registration for some of our
websites, on-line surveys, discussion forums, opted-in e-mail newsletters, 
and through the use of cookies. When web site users request pages, our 
server automatically recognizes and collects the domain name and IP 
address of visitors to our web sites.
</p><p>
<b>Magazine Subscriber Information Collected by SSC</b>
<br>
In order for you to subscribe to an SSC print magazine, access your 
subscriber data on-line, or utilize our customization features, you 
will need to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. 
Some examples of this type of information include your name, address, 
phone number, billing address, shipping address, and e-mail address. 
You will only be asked to provide personal information that is essential 
to complete or participate in the activity that you have selected. 
</p><p>
<b>Use of Information</b>
<br>
SSC takes every precaution to protect users' information
from unauthorized use. When users submit sensitive information via our
web sites, the information is considered confidential both on-line and
off-line.  We do not allow public access to the portion of the server
that contains user information. 
</p><p>
Email addresses provided to us will only be used to send relevant and 
important SSC correspondence, such as notifying print magazine subscribers 
that their magazine was returned, or that a subscription has expired, or
alternatively, to send a user their opted-in e-mail newsletter. SSC strictly
enforces e-mail privacy and therefore, e-mail addresses are never sold 
or provided to third parties. Additionally, upon request, SSC will remove 
users (and their information) from our database or permit them to "opt-out" 
of any further e-mail newsletters that they had previously signed up for.
</p><p>
Our web server automatically recognizes and collects the domain name
and IP address of visitors to our web sites. In addition, we collect
aggregate tracking information derived mainly from tallying page
views throughout our sites, and information volunteered by the visitor, 
such as survey information and/or site registrations. The information
we collect is used to improve the content of our web pages, customize
the content and/or layout for each individual visitor, and for us to
contact visitors about our products and services as explained below.
</p><p>
If a visitor has enabled cookies in their browser, we will send a cookie
file that will only store a unique, random session ID that is maintained 
throughout the session to track the pages visited.  This allows us to 
provide our site visitors with certain conveniences, such as delivering 
unique content and helping with lost passwords.  
</p><p>
Postal addresses collected on-line may be used for periodic mailings from 
us with information on new products and services or upcoming events, and 
from other reputable companies. We allow registered users of our 
publications and services to "opt out" of receiving postal mail from 
third companies. If you do not wish to be contacted by third-party companies, 
you may check the button on the subscribe form or user registration form to 
indicate your preference. You may also provide your name and postal address
to <a href="mailto:info@ssc.com">info@ssc.com</a>, and we will be sure your 
name is removed from the list we share with other organizations. When 
contacting us, please include the titles of publications to which you 
subscribe.
</p><p>
<b>General Information</b> 
<br>
SSC is not responsible for the content or the privacy polices of 
websites to which it may provide links or the websites of its advertisers. 
</p><p>
If you have questions about this privacy statement or your dealings with
SSC, please do not hesitate to contact us at 
<a href="MAILTO:info@ssc.com">info@ssc.com</a>.
