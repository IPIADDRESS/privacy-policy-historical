<div class="ce_text first last block">
<h2 id="id-1-an-overview-of-data-protection">1. An overview of data protection</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>The following gives a simple overview of what happens to your personal information when you visit our website. Personal information is any data with which you could be personally identified. Detailed information on the subject of data protection can be found in our privacy policy found below.</p>
<h4>Data collection on our website</h4>
<h4>Who is responsible for the data collection on this website?</h4>
<p>The data collected on this website are processed by the website operator. The operator's contact details can be found in the <a title="Imprint" href="en/imprint">website's required legal notice</a>.</p>
<h4>How do we collect your data?</h4>
<p>Some data are collected when you provide it to us. This could, for example, be data you enter on a contact form.</p>
<p>Other data are collected automatically by our IT systems when you visit the website. These data are primarily technical data such as the browser and operating system you are using or when you accessed the page. These data are collected automatically as soon as you enter our website.</p>
<h4>What do we use your data for?</h4>
<p>Part of the data is collected to ensure the proper functioning of the website. Other data can be used to analyze how visitors use the site.</p>
<h4>What rights do you have regarding your data?</h4>
<p>You always have the right to request information about your stored data, its origin, its recipients, and the purpose of its collection at no charge. You also have the right to request that it be corrected, blocked, or deleted. You can contact us at any time using the address given in the legal notice if you have further questions about the issue of privacy and data protection. You may also, of course, file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities.</p>
<h3>Analytics and third-party tools</h3>
<p>When visiting our website, statistical analyses may be made of your surfing behavior. This happens primarily using cookies and analytics. The analysis of your surfing behavior is usually anonymous, i.e. we will not be able to identify you from this data. You can object to this analysis or prevent it by not using certain tools. Detailed information can be found in the following privacy policy.</p>
<h2 id="id-2-general-information-and">2. General information and mandatory information</h2>
<h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data</h3>
<p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
<h3>Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities</h3>
<p>If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities. The competent regulatory authority for matters related to data protection legislation is the data protection officer of the German state Saxony in which our company is headquartered. Their contact details can be found at the following link: <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Adressen/LfD/Sachsen.html?nn=5217144">https://www.bfdi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Adressen/LfD/Sachsen.html?nn=5217144</a></p>
<h3>Right to data portability</h3>
<p>You have the right to have data which we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you require the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>
<h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
<p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the transmission of confidential content, so that the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
<h3>Information, blocking, deletion</h3>
<p>As permitted by law, you have the right to be provided at any time with information free of charge about any of your personal data that is stored as well as its origin, the recipient and the purpose for which it has been processed.

<h2 id="id-3-data-collection-on-our-website">3. Data collection on our website</h2>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.</p>
<p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called “session cookies”. They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.</p>
<p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p>
<p>Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use (such as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.</p>
<h3>Server log files</h3>
<p>The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in “server log files”. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser type and browser version</li>
<li>Operating system used</li>
<li>Referrer URL</li>
<li>Time of the server request</li>
<li>IP address</li>
</ul>
<p>These data will not be combined with data from other sources.</p>
<p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.</p>
<h2 id="id-4-analytics-and-advertising">4. Analytics and advertising</h2>
<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service. It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
<p>Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”. These are text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you.

<p>Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
<h4>IP anonymization</h4>
<p>We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website. Your IP address will be shortened by Google within the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services regarding website activity and Internet usage for the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with any other data held by Google.</p>
<h4>Browser plugin</h4>
<p>You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. However, we wish to point out that doing so may mean you will not be able to enjoy the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent the data generated by cookies about your use of the website (incl. your IP address) from being passed to Google, and the processing of these data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a></p>
<h4>Objecting to the collection of data</h4>
<p>You can prevent the collection of your data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie will be set to prevent your data from being collected on future visits to this site: <a href="javascript:gaOptout()">Disable Google Analytics</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about how Google Analytics handles user data, see Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en</a></p>
<h4>Outsourced data processing</h4>
<p>We have entered into an agreement with Google for the outsourcing of our data processing and fully implement the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.</p>
<h3>Google AdSense</h3>
<p>This website uses Google AdSense, a service for including advertisements from Google Inc. (Google). It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
<p>Google AdSense uses so-called “cookies”, which are text files stored in your computer that enable an analysis of the way you use the website. Google AdSense also uses so-called web beacons (invisible graphics). Through these web beacons, information such as the visitor traffic on these pages can be evaluated.</p>
<p>The information generated by cookies and web beacons relating to your use of this website (including your IP address), and delivery of advertising formats, is transmitted to a Google server in the US and stored there. This information can be passed on from Google to contracting parties of Google. However, Google will not merge your IP address with other data you have stored.</p>
<p>AdSense cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
<p>You can prevent the installation of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly. Please be aware that in this case, you may not be able to make full use of all the features of this website. By using this website, you agree to the processing of data relating to you and collected by Google as described and for the purposes set out above.</p>
<h2 id="id-5-newsletter">5. Newsletter</h2>
<h3>Newsletter data</h3>
<p>If you would like to receive our newsletter, we require a valid email address as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and that you agree to receive this newsletter. No additional data is collected or is only collected on a voluntary basis. We only use this data to send the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.</p>
<p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email address as well as their use for sending the newsletter at any time, e.g. through the “unsubscribe” link in the newsletter. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
<p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your subscription when said data will be deleted. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remain unaffected.</p>
<h2 id="id-6-plugins-and-tools">6. Plugins and tools</h2>
<h3>Google Web Fonts</h3>
<p>For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.</p>
<p>When you call up a page of our website that contains a social plugin, your browser makes a direct connection with Google servers. Google thus becomes aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.</p>
<p>If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer.</p>
<p>Further information about handling user data, can be found at <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a> and in Google's privacy policy at <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a></p>
<h3>YouTube</h3>
<p>Our website uses plugins from YouTube, which is operated by Google. The operator of the pages is YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.</p>
<p>If you visit one of our pages featuring a YouTube plugin, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. Here the YouTube server is informed about which of our pages you have visited.</p>
<p>If you're logged in to your YouTube account, YouTube allows you to associate your browsing behavior directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.</p>
<p>YouTube is used to help make our website appealing. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.</p>
<p>Further information about handling user data, can be found in the data protection declaration of YouTube under <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy</a></p>
