We have included below information about which data is collected, how we process and use your data, but before we would like to explain the basis on which we do so:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Where you sign up for any of our Services, we process your personal data in order to perform our contract with you;</li>
                <li>If we have a legitimate interest in processing data, such as for direct marketing or online identifiers; or</li>
                <li>We will also process your personal data where you have provided us with consent to do so.</li>

            <p><b>Types of Information We Collect</b></p>
            <p>The <b>first type</b> of information is non-identifiable information which may be made available or gathered via your use of the Site or the Services ("<b>Non-Personal Data</b>"). We are not aware of the identity of the user from which the Non-Personal Data was collected.</p>
            <p>The Non-Personal Data which is being collected may include your aggregated usage information and technical information transmitted by your device, including, type of browser, the type of the user's device and technical information pertaining to the user's device, language preferences, time stamps, clicks and visited pages, search logs, the operating system, utilized internet service provider and other similar information.</p>
            <p>The <b>second type</b> of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual ("<b>Personal Data</b>"). Personal Data voluntarily provided by you (e.g., email address, etc.) as well as your Internet Protocol ("<b>IP</b>") addresses. Note that IPs are considered "Personal Data" in many jurisdictions (such as the EEA), thus, the Company treats IPs as such and complies with applicable laws.</p>
