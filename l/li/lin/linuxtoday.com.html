<font size="+1">LINUX TODAY PRIVACY POLICY</font>

</p><p>
Linux Today respects the privacy of readers who visit each of the sites
within the Linux Today network. No effort is made to identify individuals
without their knowledge.  The following policies are in effect for all of
the Web pages owned and operated by Linux Today.  These include:
linuxtoday.com, linuxpr.com and jobs.linuxtoday.com.

</p><p>
When a reader requests pages at any Linux Today site, our Web servers
automatically recognize the browser's domain name and IP address. Our
servers do not record e-mail addresses. We collect the domain names and IP
addresses in order to aggregate information on what pages readers access or
visit. This information is collected solely for statistical purposes and is
not used to identify individuals.  

</p><p>
We ask readers to provide their e-mail address or mailing address for the
purpose of customizing their Linux Today browsing experience, to subscribe
to our e-mail newsletters or, occasionally, for a survey or to provide
additional services. Whenever the identity of a reader is recorded, we will
clearly indicate the purpose of the request before the information is
requested. If you choose to supply your postal address in an online form,
it will only be used for the purpose indicated.

</p><p>
From time to time, Linux Today or its advertisers may send a cookie to your
computer.  This information is collected solely for statistical purposes
and is not used to identify individuals.  

</p><p>
When you participate in Linux Today talkbacks, your name or alias is
recorded solely for the purpose of identifying your post to other readers.
No effort is made to further identify individuals who participate in
talkbacks or to monitor their activity in any way. 

</p><p>
<font size="+1">E-NEWSLETTER PRIVACY POLICY</font>

</p><p>
Linux Today maintains a strict "no-spam" policy.  Your e-mail address will
not be sold to a third party if you sign up for one of our e-newsletters. 

</p><p>
If you sign up for a Linux Today e-newsletter, you will receive only
the e-newsletter you have requested. You may receive on occasion an
offer to sign up for a new e-newsletter, but you will not receive additional
e-newsletters unless you specifically request them. 

</p><p>
You may have your e-mail address removed from Linux Today's mailings at any
time by following the instructions in the e-mails you receive.
