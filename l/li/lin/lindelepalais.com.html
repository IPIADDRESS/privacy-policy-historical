<p>Before sending back any goods, the customer must have received an acceptance email from the Vendor, complete with an authorisation code; return shipments shall be clearly marked with the returned item authorisation code on the outside of the packaging.</p>
<p>8.3 Once withdrawal has been exercised and the acceptance email received from L’INDE, the customer shall return the items, delivering them to the courier (postal or private service but in any case, shipping must be tracked) for shipping, no later than fourteen (14) days from the date of informing the Vendor of the intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>
<p>8.4 The customer will be required to pay the costs for returning purchased items unless the Vendor has expressly waived these costs at the time of accepting the return and provided that the customer uses the courier stated by the Vendor in the return form and/or in the email accepting the request to return an item. In case of purchases made from countries outside the European Union, the customer will be required to pay any customs charges met by L’INDE for the return of items into Italy.</p>
<p>8.5 If the customer decides to use the courier named by the Vendor, they will not have to pay the costs for returns. Payment of costs to return purchased products will be made by the Vendor on the customer’s behalf, which therefore frees the customer from any obligation to make direct payment to the courier.

<p>8.6 If the customer decides to use a method other than the courier named by the Vendor, they will be responsible for payment of the costs for the returns.</p>

<p>the Return form, correctly sent online through the website or other explicit declaration of the customer’s decision to withdraw from the contract, must be correctly completed and sent to the Vendor within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the products;</p>
<p>items must not have been used, worn or washed;</p>
<p>the original ID tag, which is an integral part of the product, must still be attached to the products along with any disposable seal.</p>
<p>Products must be returned in their original packaging (in case of audio CDs, books, design items, the package must have its original seals. Customers who wish to return a kit, must return all of the items of which it is composed);</p>
<p>returned items must be delivered to the courier no later than fourteen (14) days from the date of informing the Vendor of the intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>
<p>items must not be damaged.</p>
<p>8.8 If the Right of Withdrawal is exercised according to the methods and terms stated in section 8, the Vendor will refund any sums already paid for the items according to the methods and terms stated.</p>
<p>8.9 Refunds will be paid to the customer according to the methods and within the time stated in art. 9.2, and in any case, no later than fourteen (14) days from the date on which the Vendor was informed of the intention to use the right of withdrawal. The Vendor will implement the refund procedure once the correct execution of the terms and conditions above has been checked, as stated in section 9.</p>
<p>8.10 If the methods and terms for exercising the right of withdrawal have not been complied with, the customer will not have the right to a refund for the sums already paid to the Vendor. Within 14 days from the sending date of the email stating refusal of the return, the customer may opt to have the items returned to them, at their expense and in the same condition in which they were returned to the Vendor and informing the Vendor of this choice and according to the method that will be notified to them. If this is not the case, the Vendor may keep the items, as well the sums paid for their purchase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>9. Refund time and method</b></p>
<p>9.1 After the product has been returned, the Vendor will make the necessary checks of the conformity of the items under the conditions and terms stated in section 8. In case the checks are positive, the Vendor will commence the process to make the refund to the customer. In case the checks are not positive, the Vendor will inform the customer, by email, of the reduction in the value of the returned items, due to failure by the customer to comply with the conditions in section 8.7. At the same time, the Vendor will inform the customer that the amount will be deducted from the purchase price paid by the customer for the returned items and will make a partial refund, without prejudice to the alternative, which is to accept, at their own expense, the items in the same condition as returned to the Vendor and according to that stated in the above section 8.10.</p>
<p>9.2 Whatever method of payment used by the customer, the refund, whether full or partial, will be processed by the Vendor in the smallest possible amount of time, according to art 56, subsection III of the Consumer Code, and in any case, within fourteen (14) days from the date on which the Vendor was informed of the customer’s intention to exercise the right of withdrawal and the check of returned items.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.3 The Vendor will make the refund in euro, using the same method of payment as used by the customer to make the purchase. When there is no correspondence between the recipient of the item stated on the order form and the person who paid for the purchase, the sum will be refunded by the Vendor, in case of exercise of the right of withdrawal, to the person who made the purchase.</p>
<p>9.4 The Vendor will state the courier to use to return items (UPS, DHL, etc.). Using a courier service, stating the authorisation number for the return, as provided by the Vendor, the customer may return items to the Vendor without paying the additional costs directly. According to the methods and terms set out for exercise of the right of withdrawal, this method will allow Vendors to make direct payment, on the customer’s behalf, of the costs for returning the purchased items, freeing them of all obligation to make direct payment to the courier. The Vendor will deduct the amount paid for standard shipping of the returned items from the amount of the refund.</p>
<p>9.6 In case the customer decides to use a different courier to the service named by the Vendor, they will be liable for the shipping costs and, including liability in case of loss or damage to the products.</p>

<p><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Control via browser</span></i><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">: </span></i>The browsers commonly used (e.g. Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari) accept cookies by default, but this setting can be changed by the User at any time. This applies to both PCs and mobile devices like tablets and smartphones, and it is a function generally and widely supported.</p>
<p>Therefore, cookies can easily be disabled or turned off by accessing the browser’s options or preferences, and in general third-party cookies can also be blocked. As a general rule, these options will only have an impact on that browser and on that device, unless there are active options to synchronize the preferences on different devices. Specific instructions can be found on the Options page or Help page of the browser itself. Disabling technical cookies, however, may affect the full and/ or proper functioning of different sites, including this one.</p>
<p>Normally, browsers used today:</p>
<ul>
<li>offer the “Do not track” option, which is supported by some websites (but not all). Thus, these websites are no longer able to collect certain navigation data;</li>
<li>offer the option of anonymous surfing or incognito mode: in this way, data will not be collected in the browser and browsing history will not be saved, but the navigation data may still be acquired by the operator of the Web Site that was visited;</li>
<li>allow the deletion of cookies stored in whole or in part, but after visiting a Web Site again they are usually installed, where such possibility is not blocked.</li>
