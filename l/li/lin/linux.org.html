<b>Linux Online Inc. Privacy Policy</b></font>

</p><p>
Linux Online respects your privacy. In order to show you that we take every 
measure to insure the privacy our visitors, we would like to explain what we do to make sure that any information gathered about our visitors, either directly or indirectly, is handled properly.

</p><p>
<b>When you visit our website</b>

</p><p>
When you visit Linux Online, your computer is connected to ours for the duration of your visit. This creates an entry in our logs containing information about your Internet Service Provider or other means that you have used to access our website and its pages as well as information 
about your browser and the time and date of access.  We may use this 
information to try to improve the content of our website. We may also use this information to solve problems related to connections or viewing of our pages. But the entries contained in our access logs can never give us information about you as an individual.

</p><p>
<b>E-mail Addresses</b>

</p><p>
An Internet Service Provider or other organization that you use to connect to 
the Internet normally provides you with an e-mail address. Besides using your 
address for written communication, it also serves as a means to identify you.
Linux Online receives e-mail addresses from its users voluntarily. You may
provide your e-mail address in order to participate in our volunteer program, 
to make a suggestion or to ask a question.  Linux Online keeps these e-mail 
addresses on file at our company. We do not make these e-mail addresses
available to third parties.  

</p><p>You may also provide your e-mail address to our mailing list in order to receive our Linux
Online newsletter and other mailings of interest to the Linux community. Please refer to the
next section, <b><i>Mailing Lists</i></b> for information about the use of your e-mail address
for this purpose.

</p><p>
<b>Mailing Lists</b>  

</p><p>
Linux Online maintains an opt-in mailing list and occasionally we must provide 
 bonded mailing houses with your e-mail address to carry out this service. The fact that they
are bonded means that they do not provide your address to third parties. If you have signed
up for an opt-in mailing list and you later wish to opt-out, you may do this by following
the instructions on the newsletter or other mailing that you receive. This usually entails
sending an e-mail to <i>remove@linux.org</i> with your <i>unique ID number</i> in the body of the message. 
</p><p>When you sign up for our mailing lists, you will be sent our weekly Linux Online newsletter and other announcements of interest to Linux users and enthusiasts about site updates and new Linux products and services. Please be aware that Linux Online includes paid advertisements in them in order to defray the costs of providing you with the information in them. 


</p><p>
<b>Public Forums / Question and Answer Areas</b>

</p><p>
Public forums are just as the name implies: public, as are question and answer
services. The information given in these areas becomes known by individuals 
outside of our organization. You should use your judgment as to whether or not you want your
e-mail address or any other information known by the public when posting information 
to a public forum or requesting or giving or requesting support in a question and answer 
area. 

</p><p>
<b>Volunteer Work</b>

</p><p>
We are proud of the fact that our visitors go to great lengths to help us 
provide new and important content about Linux. If you choose to do volunteer 
work for us, you can be assured that any personal information we ask you to 
provide is only used to help us coordinate your much appreciated work and will 
remain strictly confidential.

</p><p>
<b>Advertising</b>

</p><p>
Advertising on any communication medium serves to get information and
entertainment to the end user without incurring any costs upon him or her. 
Linux Online accepts and actively solicits advertisers in order to defray the costs of
providing our visitors with information about the Linux operating system. 
This website displays banners and other advertising formats provided to us 
by other companies. Our visitors should know that when they click on one
of these banners, they are making a decision to leave our website and
view another. Linux Online makes every effort to insure that our advertisers
activities meet with accepted standards of ethics and decency. However, Linux 
Online accepts no responsibility for the privacy policy of our advertisers,
nor do we have any control over the information gathered by those
advertisers on their websites.

</p><p>Advertising may also take the form of inclusion on our Linux Online newsletter and other
mailings of interest. As we stated before, Linux Online does not share e-mail addresses or
any other information about the recipients of our mailing list.
 
  
</p><p>
<b>Contests, Giveaways and Surveys</b>

</p><p>
From time to time, Linux Online will engage in contests, surveys and 
giveaways aimed at improving the content of our website and awarding our 
valued visitors' loyalty to us. In order to participate in these activities, 
visitors may be requested to provide personal information, such as, but not 
limited to, name, address, postal information, telephone numbers, e-mail 
addresses, age, educational level and recent purchases.  Our visitors must 
provide this information voluntarily and if they feel that they do not want 
to reveal any of this data, they are requested not to do so. If a visitor 
chooses to provide us with this information, we want to make clear that it will
be used by Linux Online only to create general demographic profiles to provide to our 
current and potential advertisers. This will assist them in making a 
decision to continue or start an advertising campaign. We will in no way use 
or divulge specific data about individual visitors. 
  
</p><p>
<b>Security For Your Purchases</b>

</p><p>
Linux Online sells a ceramic mug with our company's logo on it to help defray the costs of telephone services. When you choose to purchase this item, you may do so by way of either a standard order form or a secure order form. Our customers should realize that the secure order form is the recommended means of making online purchases. This form uses the best industry standard 
encryption techniques known at this time. The data on this form will only be  
be handled by authorized personnel trained in the use of sensitive information.
 Our visitors should be aware that by choosing a method other than the secure
form, sensitive data such as credit card numbers may be intercepted by third 
parties.   

</p><p>
<b>Cookies</b>

</p><p>
A 'cookie' is small file which is sent to a user along with a web page so that
websites may receive information about viewers' preferences. A company such as ours cannot obtain personal information about specific visitors by using 
'cookies'. Furthermore, browser settings can be changed so that you never
receive them or you only receive 'cookies' from those sites that you wish. This may, however, result in some content loss. If you feel that receiving such files is not in your best interest, we advise you to configure your browser so 
that you do not receive them. We will adhere to the same standards of privacy as regards to 'cookies' as with any other means of gathering information.  

</p><p>
<b>Children</b> 

</p><p>
Linux Online is a website designed to be viewed by anyone of any age who has an interest in the Linux operating system. We do not have any content area which we feel should not be viewed by children. We adhere to the strictest standards
of decency and ethics demanded by our profession. Parents should know that
when their children use the Internet without parental supervision they could
divulge data about themselves unwillingly. Linux Online will not provide 
a good, service or information directly to a minor as far as it is in our
power to determine a person's age. 

</p><p>
<b>This Privacy Policy</b>

</p><p>
We are grateful to you, the Linux Online visitor for
making this website the premier source of Linux information on the Internet.
We are sure that you know that by visiting our site, you are acknowledging
that you accept this privacy policy and recognize the measures we take
to insure your privacy. The Internet is an industry that grows and changes 
everyday. At Linux Online we may make changes to this policy as we see fit 
to insure that we adapt to this growing industry. We will make every attempt 
to post those changes in a timely fashion. If you have any questions regarding
this privacy policy, we invite you to contact our webmaster at <a href="mailto:webmaster@linux.org"> webmaster@linux.org</a>
