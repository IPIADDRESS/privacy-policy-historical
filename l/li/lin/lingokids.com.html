<p>
<b>Information We Collect from Children.</b> Children can access some parts of our website and its content and use some of its features without providing us with Personal Information.

We only collect as much information about a child as is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in the educational activity in our Services, and we do not condition his or her participation on the disclosure of more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary.
</p>
<p>

<p>
We may combine non-personal information we collect through these technologies with Personal Information about you or your child that we collect online.
