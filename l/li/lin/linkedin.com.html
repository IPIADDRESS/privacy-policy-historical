    <h3>Information Collection</h3>
    <p><em>Registration:</em><br>
      In order to become a LinkedIn user, you must first create an account on this web site.  To create an account you are required to provide the following contact information: name, email address, country, ZIP/postal code, a brief summary of your professional background (current occupation &amp; networking objectives), and choose a password.</p>
    <p><em>Profile Information:</em><br>
      Once a user, you may provide additional information in the Profile section describing your skills, professional experiences, and networking objectives.  Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find new opportunities in the LinkedIn system.</p>
    <p><em>Information about your Contacts</em><br>
      In order to invite others to connect with you directly in LinkedIn, you will enter their names and email addresses.  This information will be used by LinkedIn to send your invitation including a message that you write.  The names and email addresses of people that you invite will be used only to send your invitation and reminders.</p>
    <p>You may also choose to manually enter or upload data about your contacts into the private “My Contacts” section of our website.   All information entered there will only be viewable by you and will not be searchable by others in the LinkedIn network without your permission.</p>
    <p>All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this privacy policy as cover your own personally identifiable information.</p>
    <p><em>Cookies &amp; Log Files:</em><br>
      Like most web sites, LinkedIn uses cookies and web log files to track site usage.  A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows LinkedIn to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website.  Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.</p>
    <p>One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you’ve logged in to your LinkedIn account.  The next time you visit the LinkedIn web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to log in before using the service.  In order to access or change any of your private information (like a credit card number), however, you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie.  Additionally, if you log out of the LinkedIn site you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account.  Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the LinkedIn site.  Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.</p>
    <p>Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the LinkedIn web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave LinkedIn.  We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr>.  This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the LinkedIn service.  The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law.</p>
    <p><em>Web Beacons:</em><br>
      We allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to LinkedIn users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. LinkedIn may “target” some ads to users that fit a certain general profile — for example, “product managers in Texas.” LinkedIn does NOT use personally identifiable information to target ads.</p>
    <p>To deliver these ads properly, LinkedIn may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by LinkedIn so the networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites.</p>
    <p>Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>
    <p>These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. You will never see additional ads as a result of being a LinkedIn user and LinkedIn never provides personally identifiable information to any advertiser nor any third party.</p>
    <p>You may opt-out of use of Web beacons in LinkedIn pages that you view and of placement of a cookie by ad networks in your browser. To opt-out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/secure/settings?advt=">click here</a> and go to the “Advertising” section at the bottom and change the setting there to “No”.</p>
    <p>In addition, this Web site uses the technology of DoubleClick Inc. to serve ads only when you visit this site. DoubleClick may use non-personal information, such as your state or zip code, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you while you visit this Web site. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, DoubleClick may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by DoubleClick, please <a href="/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Edoubleclick%2Ecom%2Fus%2Fabout_doubleclick%2Fprivacy%2F" target="_blank" title="New window will open">click here</a>.  Note that when you opt-out of the DoubleClick cookie a special DoubleClick “opt-out” cookie will replace the DoubleClick Ad cookie. If you ever delete the cookies on your browser you will need to again opt-out of the DoubleClick Ad Cookie.</p>
    <p>If you opt-out you will lose the potential benefit of receiving ads that are more targeted to your interests.</p>
    <p><em>Children:</em><br>
      Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us or use the service.</p>
    
    <h3>Information Use</h3>
    <p>LinkedIn is an online service dedicated to helping all types of professionals more effectively connect with one another. The personally identifiable information you choose to provide on this site is used to help you describe yourself to other users. Other information, that does not personally identify you as an individual, is collected by LinkedIn Corporation from the site (such as, by way of example, patterns of utilization) and is exclusively owned by LinkedIn. This information can be utilized by LinkedIn in such manner as LinkedIn, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.</p>
    <p><em>LinkedIn Communications:</em><br>
      LinkedIn will communicate with you through email and notices posted on this website.  These include a series of up to five welcome emails which help inform new users about various features of the service.  Please be aware that you will always receive certain emails from LinkedIn related to the proper functioning of your account, such as email notices when another user in your network sends you an opportunity.  LinkedIn may send you promotional information unless you have opted out of receiving such information.  If you wish to opt-out of receiving promotional emails, please send a request to <a href="mailto:customer_service@linkedin.com">customer_service@linkedin.com</a>.</p>
    <p><em>Customized Content:</em><br>
      Information you provide at registration or in your Profile section is also used to customize your experience on the web site.  For example, when you login to your account we will display the screen names of new users who have recently joined your network.</p>
    
    <h3>Information Sharing</h3><p></p>
    <p><em>Sharing Information With Third Parties:</em><br>
      LinkedIn takes the privacy of our users very seriously.  We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to any third parties for marketing purposes.  We will only share your personally identifiable with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific services.  For instance, we use a credit card processing company to bill users for subscription fees.  These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.</p>
      <p>LinkedIn offers a “public profile” feature which allows users to publish portions of their LinkedIn profile, including your “name”, but not your “email address” to the public Internet.  Users may opt-out of this feature, however LinkedIn does not warrant how third-party search engines will update their cache.</p>
      <p>We may provide aggregated data about the usage of our services to third-parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate.  We may segment our users by role (i.e. product managers, vice presidents), industry, geographic location, company.  If you would like to be excluded from the aggregated research or products based upon aggregated data about our users’ activities on the site, please email customer service.</p>
    <p><em>Partnering with Other Organizations to Offer Combined Services:</em><br>LinkedIn partners with other online services to give you the combined results of both services.  For example we partner with SimplyHired.com to let you use their services to find jobs and then to use LinkedIn to find trusted referrals to those jobs.  Whenever we offer such combined services it will be your choice to make use of the combined services or not.  In these cases, your personally identifiable information will only be passed from LinkedIn to the partner if you choose to use the combined service.</p>
    <p><em>Communications Between Users:</em><br>
      Many emails you initiate through LinkedIn, an invitation sent to a non-user for instance, will list your email address and name in the header of the message.  Emails you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your network (for instance how many people are in your network), but will never list the people to whom you’re directly connected.  Other communications that you initiate through the LinkedIn website, like a request for contact, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal contact information.  Your contact information will only be shared with another user if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish contact with each other.</p>
    <p><em>Legal Disclaimer:</em><br>
      It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law.  We will disclose such information wherein we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on our company or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
    
    <h3>Accessing and Changing Your Account Information</h3>
    <p>You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired changes to the information, or to the settings for your LinkedIn account, at any time by logging in to your account on the LinkedIn website and editing the information on your Profile page. You can also close your account through the LinkedIn website. If you close your LinkedIn account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our publicly viewable data. We may retain certain data contributed by you if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law.  All retained data will continue to be subject to the terms of the LinkedIn Privacy Policy that you have previously agree to.  To request that we close your account and remove your information from the LinkedIn service, please send your request to <a href="mailto:customer_service@linkedin.com">customer_service@linkedin.com</a>.  Please send your request using an email account that you have registered with LinkedIn under your name. You will receive a response to requests sent to <a href="mailto:customer_service@linkedin.com">customer_service@linkedin.com</a> within three business days of our receiving it.</p>
    
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>In order to secure your personal information, access to your data on LinkedIn is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as credit card information) is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and our web site.  To protect any data you store on our servers we also regularly audit our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and we use a tier-one secured-access data center.</p>
    <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>LinkedIn may update this privacy policy.  In the event there are significant changes in the way we treat your personally identifiable information, we will display a notice on this site.  Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.</p>
