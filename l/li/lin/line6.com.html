	<u>Required Disclosures</u><br>
	Line 6 may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to prevent injury or property damage.

	<br>
	<u>Information Sharing and Third Party Service Partners</u><br>
	Line 6 does not rent, sell or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies without your consent (see our Opt-Out Policy below) or unless we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce any applicable Terms of Service (including investigation of potential violations thereof), or (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.<br>

	<b>OPT-OUT POLICY </b><br>
	Line 6 allows you to opt out of our use of your Personal Information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was provided. This would include, by way of example, marketing and promotional mailings relating to Line 6 products and services. You may exercise this option at the time your Personal Information is collected by checking the appropriate ["NO THANKS"] box. And, in some cases, we ask you to affirmatively indicate your consent to receive marketing and promotional materials. If you do not affirmatively indicate your consent to do so, we will not send you any additional materials other than those required by our specific agreement with you.<br>
	<br>

	Line 6 collects various types of personally identifiable information about you during the course of our customer relationship.  Under California law, if you are a resident of California, you may make a written request to Line 6 about how we have shared your information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  In response to your written request, Line 6 is allowed to provide you with a notice describing the cost-free means to opt-out of our sharing your information with third parties with whom we do not share the same brand name, if the third party will use such information for its direct marketing purposes.<br>
