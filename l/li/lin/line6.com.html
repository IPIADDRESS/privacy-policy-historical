	<br>
	<u>Automated Data Capture</u><br>
	We may automatically track certain information about your use of the Website.

This information will be used to prepare statistical data, analyzed to improve troubleshooting techniques and responses, and used to improve the value of the materials and services available through the Website.<br>
	<br>
	Cookies are small text files that are stored on the site visitor's computer and used to gather and keep track of non-personal information related to you. Information collected through cookies is not linked to any personally identifiable information. Cookies help Line 6 review the Website traffic patterns and improve the Website. Although many browsers are set to accept cookies, you can set your browser to reject cookies, but this may prevent you from using some of the convenience features the Website.<br>
	<br>
	<u>Sensitive Information</u><br>
	We do not request, and we ask that you not provide, "<b>sensitive information,</b>" that is, Personal Information indicating medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religions or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying sexual orientation.

	<br>
	<b>USE OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</b><br>

	<br>
	<u>Required Disclosures</u><br>
	Line 6 may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to prevent injury or property damage. We will usually attempt to notify you when we are making such a disclosure, but we may not do so in an emergency or when we are prohibited by law or court order from giving such notice.<br>
	<br>
	<u>Information Sharing and Third Party Service Partners</u><br>
	Line 6 does not rent, sell or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies without your consent (see our Opt-Out Policy below) or unless we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce any applicable Terms of Service (including investigation of potential violations thereof), or (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.<br>
	<br>
	Line 6 provides some of the Website's services through contractual arrangements with affiliates, service providers, partners and other third parties ("<b>Service Partners</b>"). Line 6 and its Service Partners use your Personal Information to operate their sites and to deliver their services. Line 6's Service Partners may also use your Personal Information to inform you of other products or services available from those Service Partners. To opt out of receiving future notifications, see our <b>Opt-Out Policy</b> below.<br><br>
	If Line 6 becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide reasonable notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Such notice may be given by a clear and concise statement on the Website home page that there has been an update to this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
	<b>OPT-OUT POLICY </b><br>
	Line 6 allows you to opt out of our use of your Personal Information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was provided. This would include, by way of example, marketing and promotional mailings relating to Line 6 products and services. You may exercise this option at the time your Personal Information is collected by checking the appropriate ["NO THANKS"] box. And, in some cases, we ask you to affirmatively indicate your consent to receive marketing and promotional materials. If you do not affirmatively indicate your consent to do so, we will not send you any additional materials other than those required by our specific agreement with you.<br>
	<br>
	<b>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</b><br>
	Line 6 collects various types of personally identifiable information about you during the course of our customer relationship.  Under California law, if you are a resident of California, you may make a written request to Line 6 about how we have shared your information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  In response to your written request, Line 6 is allowed to provide you with a notice describing the cost-free means to opt-out of our sharing your information with third parties with whom we do not share the same brand name, if the third party will use such information for its direct marketing purposes.<br>
	<br>
	If you would like to exercise your rights under California law, please send our written request to the email address or postal address below.  Please include your postal address in your request.  Within thirty (30) days of receiving your written request, Line 6 will provide you with a Third Party Direct Marketing Out-Out Form so you may request that your personal information not be disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.<br>
