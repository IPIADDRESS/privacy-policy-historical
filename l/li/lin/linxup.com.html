We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies.</p>
                <p>Agilis will collect information about you when you do any of the following: (i) register to become a customer; (ii) use any of our services, including when you use a mobile device equipped with one of our services; (iii) use this website; (iv) participate in one of our promotions, such as a sweepstakes; or (v) request information about our services from us or from another company through which our services are offered (such as a mobile telecommunications provider).

Such information may be uploaded to our servers, to be used (generally in an anonymous format) to monitor the status of the communication network and data processing systems.                  </p>
                <p>We will not sell or disclose to unaffiliated third parties without your consent your location and route information that we collect during your use of our services, except as otherwise provided in this policy. However, from time to time we will disclose, and may sell, to unaffiliated third parties other information that we collect about you, including information that we collect through your registration to be a customer, your participation in one of our promotions, or your request to us or one of our partners for information about our services.

                  We collect information about you when you register to become a customer of the Agilis service, and when you otherwise transmit such information to us via our website or by email. Specifically, to maintain your account we collect and store in a database your name, billing address, email address, 10-digit mobile phone number (or device ID/number as required), mobile phone model, wireless carrier, and in certain circumstances your credit card number.                 </p>
                <p> We use your name, billing address, and credit card number for the purpose of billing you for the Agilis service.                  </p>
                <p>We use your email address to contact you with regard to your account, such as to communicate that it is about to expire or to confirm any change to your phone number, and to respond to any inquiry you submit via our website or by email. We also may use your email address from time to time to inform you about our products and services that we think will interest you.                  </p>
                <p>As a customer of Agilis, you may also create a username and password, which we store in our database, for the purpose of you logging into your account via the website link provided to you by Agilis. In some cases, the usernames and / or passwords are generated for you automatically on your wireless device, and cannot be altered.                  </p>
                <p>As a customer of Agilis, you also have the option of providing us with your home and work addresses (to the extent they differ from your billing address), which we store in our database, to enable you to access other features on the Agilis service.                  </p>
                <p>On some versions of the Agilis service, you can also create a list of addresses that you may edit on our website, or on your mobile device. We store these addresses in our database so that you can access them from your mobile device, and so that should you change devices, this collection of addresses will still be available to you. <br>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        Each time you access the Agilis service, we periodically receive and record your current location from the GPS hardware associated with your vehicle.  All location data submitted to Agilis will remain the sole property of you to the full extent provided by law.  Agilis will not use the location data for any purpose other than to provide the Service to you and for statistical reporting purposes. Agilis may aggregate anonymous statistical data regarding use and functioning of its system by its various customers. Such aggregated statistical data will be the sole property of Agilis.</p>
                <p> We maintain a database with this location and route information, and may keep such information indefinitely. We use this location and route information to the extent reasonably necessary to provide and maintain the Service and for determining where we should emphasize improving our map coverage and service capabilities, and to improve your user experience.  Agilis will use commercially reasonable security measures to protect your data against unauthorized disclosure or use. <br>

                <p>We store this information in our database and will use it to communicate with you about the promotion. We may also use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.                  </p>
