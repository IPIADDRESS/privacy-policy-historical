                                Web Beacons: Our Website may contain electronic image requests
                                (called a “single-pixel gif” or “web beacon” request) that allow us to count page
                                views and to access cookies. Any electronic image viewed as part of a web page
                                (including an ad banner) can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are typically
                                1by-1 pixel files (so small that you would likely not realize that they are there),
                                but their presence can usually be seen within a browser by clicking on “View”
                                and then on “Source.” We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted
                                newsletters that we send to opt-in subscribers in order to count how many
                                newsletters have been read. Our web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or
                                share any personally identifiable information.
                                They are just the technique we use to compile anonymous information about
                                the Website and Service usage.
