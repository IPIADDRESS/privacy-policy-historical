<h1><font face="Arial" size="2">
<a name="WhoNewAndInformationUse"></a>About LDS LinkUp and its 
Use of Information</font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial" size="1">LDS LinkUp is an online 
community that allows its members to post personal profiles and to 
browse or search personal profiles posted by others in order to identify and 
contact new people they might want to meet.&nbsp; The profiles can contain personal 
information about, among other things, a member's appearance, ethnicity, 
profession, religion, and interests.&nbsp; The profiles may also contain 
photographs.&nbsp; Collecting this information from members and providing 
services that enable members to search or browse through such profiles is 
fundamental to LDS LinkUp's business.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="1">At the same time, LDS LinkUp is dedicated to 
protecting its 
members' privacy.&nbsp; LDS LinkUp is designed to give its members more control 
over their personal information, including their LDS LinkUp profiles, than 
traditional online dating services.&nbsp; Through its "<a href="whonewfaq.asp#WhatisVisibility">Visibility 
Preference</a>" setting, LDS LinkUp allows each member choice as to who can see his or 
her personal profile.&nbsp; In particular, LDS LinkUp allows each member to restrict viewership 
of his or her profile to  LDS LinkUp 
members only, or, if he or she wishes, to  all website visitors.</font></p>

<h1><font face="Arial" size="2">
<a name="WhatInfoIsCollected"></a>What Information  LDS LinkUp Collects</font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial" size="1">LDS LinkUp collects six types of information about 
its users:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="1"><b>ID and contact information</b> - Includes 
  Members' names and email addresses.</font></li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 6"><font face="Arial" size="1"><b>Profile Information (excluding photographs)</b> 
  - Includes information supplied by each Member for his or her personal LDS LinkUp 
  profile.&nbsp;Profiles may include information on member's appearance, 
  ethnicity, profession, religion, interests, and other descriptive information 
  provided by the Member.&nbsp; It 
  may also include information about what the Member is looking for in a 
  potential match.&nbsp; LDS LinkUp may supplement this information in a Member's 
  profile with limited <i>activity information</i>, for example, when a Member 
  joined LDS LinkUp or how recently the Member has logged in to LDS LinkUp.&nbsp; Note 
  that LDS LinkUp prohibits inclusion of Personally Identifying Information (see 
  below) other than photographs in its profiles.</font></p></li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 6"><font face="Arial" size="1"><b>Photographs</b> - 
  Includes photographs uploaded or otherwise transmitted by Members as part of 
  their LDS LinkUp profiles.</font></p></li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 6"><font face="Arial" size="1"><b>Messaging Information</b> - Includes the 
  text, sender, addressee, and time sent of email messages sent through the LDS LinkUp email system.&nbsp; 
  These messages include invitations to join LDS LinkUp and messages to other Who 
  New members who may be potential matches. </font></p></li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 6"><font face="Arial" size="1"><b>Discussion Information</b> - Includes the 
  text, poster, and time sent of discussion board messages posted to the LDS LinkUp 
  discussion board system.&nbsp; </font></p></li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 6"><font face="Arial" size="1"><b>Billing Information</b> - Includes credit 
  card and billing address information necessary to complete credit card transactions to 
  pay for LDS LinkUp services.</font></p></li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 6"><font face="Arial" size="1"><b>Activity Information </b>- Includes 
  information about how a user uses the LDS LinkUp website and service, for 
  example, which pages are visited, which services are used, when a user joined 
  LDS LinkUp, when a user last logged in to LDS LinkUp, etc.&nbsp; Activity 
  information may also include how a user came to LDS LinkUp, including promotion 
  codes, etc.</font></p></li>
</ul>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="1">Where LDS LinkUp Collects Information</font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1">LDS LinkUp collects this 
information from our users at several different points on our Web site.</font></p>
<h4><i><font face="Arial" size="1">Sign-Up</font><font face="Arial"> </font>
</i></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<font face="Arial" size="1">To become a member, a user must provide <i>ID and 
contact information</i> to enable LDS LinkUp to create a unique member ID for him 
or her.&nbsp; During sign-up, new members are also encouraged to begin creating 
their personal profiles and to invite friends to join LDS LinkUp.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<font face="Arial" size="1">Because of LDS LinkUp's model, 
non-members cannot view LDS LinkUp's member profiles, unless members have 
explicitly chosen to make their profiles visible to non-members.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial" size="1">
<i>Edit Your 
Profile/Preferences</i></font></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<font face="Arial" size="1">Once a member has joined LDS LinkUp, he can edit his 
personal profile, post or unpost his profile, or change his account preferences 
at any time.&nbsp; </font></p>
<h2><i><font face="Arial" size="1">Subscription</font></i></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<font face="Arial" size="1">If a member decides to subscribe to paid LDS LinkUp services, we will request <i>billing information</i> from the member via our 
subscription 
form.&nbsp; At that point, the member must provide billing name and address information  and 
payment information (such as credit card number, expiration date, etc.) needed 
to complete the transaction.&nbsp; Because LDS LinkUp subscriptions typically renew 
automatically, LDS LinkUp typically stores billing information to allow renewal 
transactions.</font></p>
<h2><i><font face="Arial" size="1">
Invitation/Messaging</font></i></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<font face="Arial" size="1">When a member invites a friend to join LDS LinkUp or 
sends a message through the LDS LinkUp system to another LDS LinkUp member, LDS LinkUp 
collects the text and the addressee of the message.&nbsp; When a member invites 
a friend, LDS LinkUp also collects the friend’s name and email address and sends an email inviting 
the friend to visit the site.&nbsp; LDS LinkUp stores the friend's information for 
the sole purpose of sending this  email and one or more follow up emails and tracking the success of our 
referral program.&nbsp; The friend may contact LDS LinkUp at removeme@ldslinkup.com to request the removal of 
his name and email address from our database.</font></p>
<h2><i><font face="Arial" size="1">Discussion Boards</font></i></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<font face="Arial" size="1">When a member posts a message to an LDS LinkUp 
discussion board, LDS LinkUp collects the text and the posting time of the 
message, for the purpose of displaying the message on the indicated discussion 
board.&nbsp; Except where explicitly stated on the site, LDS LinkUp does not 
allow members to remove posts once they have been posted.</font></p>
<h2><i><font face="Arial" size="1">Other 
Activities</font></i></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<font face="Arial" size="1">When a member or other visitor visits the LDS LinkUp web site, LDS LinkUp 
may collect <i>activity information</i> about the member's activities, such as 
how often he visits, which pages he visits, and which LDS LinkUp services he uses.&nbsp; 
This information is used for improving the 
LDS LinkUp web site and service offering and for refining our marketing programs.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="1">How LDS LinkUp Collects Information</font></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><font face="Arial" size="1">Besides asking 
its users to provide information for their profile or for billing purposes, LDS 
LinkUp uses, or may in the future use, several different technologies (including 
cookies, log files, and clear gifs) to collect and track <i>activity information</i>.</font></span></h2>
<h2><i><font face="Arial" size="1">Cookies</font></i></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1">A cookie is a piece of data 
stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user.&nbsp; There 
are two types of cookies, temporary cookies, which disappear when the user is 
inactive for a period of time (typically 10-20 minutes) or when he closes 
his browser, and persistent cookies, which are stored for a longer period.&nbsp;  A persistent cookie is a small text file 
stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent 
cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help directions.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1">LDS LinkUp uses  temporary 
cookies to manage user sessions and to prevent unauthorized users from viewing 
member profiles.&nbsp; LDS LinkUp uses persistent cookies to remember a user's 
login information so that, if a user wishes, he can return to site after a 
period of time without having to retype his login email and password.&nbsp; Because controlling access to 
member profiles is central to LDS LinkUp's offering, users who reject all cookies 
will not be able to use the member areas of our site.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1">In the future, LDS LinkUp 
business partners (for example, advertisers) may use cookies on our site.&nbsp; 
Although LDS LinkUp will review each partner's privacy policy prior to agreeing to allow cookies,&nbsp; 
LDS LinkUp will have no access to or control over these cookies once we have 
given a partner permission to set them.&nbsp; </font></p>
<h3><i><font face="Arial" size="1">Log Files</font></i></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<font face="Arial" size="1">Like most standard Web site servers we use log 
files.&nbsp; These files collect user internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser 
types, internet service providers (ISPs), referring/exit pages, platform types, 
date/time stamps, and click counters, among other date.&nbsp; This data is used 
to analyze trends, administer the site, identify technical problems, track users' 
movements in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for 
aggregate use.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;</font></p>
<h1><i><font face="Arial" size="1">
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</font></i></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1">
We, or our business partners, may also employ a software technology called clear 
gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage the content of 
our site our our communications with our members. Clear gifs are tiny 
graphics with a unique identifier that let us know when particular pages or 
emails are accessed by users.
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1">
Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from 
the same Web site or advertising company.&nbsp; That means, for example, that if a 
person visited “www.companyX.com”, which uses an advertising company's clear 
gif, the Web site  or advertising company could match the clear gif's 
identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past 
online behavior for that computer. This collected information would then be 
given to the advertising company  or Web site.&nbsp; At present, LDS LinkUp does not 
use clear gifs in this way.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1">
In addition, we may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which 
emails have been opened by the recipients.&nbsp; This allows us to gauge the 
effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing 
campaigns.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="1">
Supplemental Information</font></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1">
In order for LDS LinkUp to deliver the highest 
quality services to its users, we may decide to supplement the information we 
gather via our web site with information from 3rd party sources.&nbsp; At this 
time, LDS LinkUp does not use information from such external sources.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="1">Personally Identifying Information</font></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1">In the course of its business, 
LDS LinkUp collects information that identifies particular Members (Personally 
Identifying Information).&nbsp; Of the seven types of information LDS LinkUp 
collects, five are Personally Identifying Information:&nbsp; ID and Contact 
Information, Photographs, Messaging Information, Discussion Information, and Billing Information.&nbsp; 
See below for LDS LinkUp's policy on sharing Personally Identifying Information.</font></p>
<h1><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="HowWhoNewUsesInfo"></a>How LDS LinkUp 
Uses Information</font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1">LDS LinkUp's uses of information 
depend on the category of information: ID/contact information, profile 
information, messaging information, discussion information, billing information, or activity 
information.&nbsp; In addition to the primary uses described below, LDS LinkUp may 
use information for other purposes including, but not restricted to, 
investigating user complaints, enforcing our Online Conduct standards (see our
<a target="_blank" href="termsofservice.asp">Terms of Service</a>), or 
communicating with law enforcement.</font></p>
<h3><i><font face="Arial" size="1">Identification and Contact Information</font></i></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1">
We use Members' ID and contact information to</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p style="margin-top: 6"><font face="Arial" size="1">create a unique Member ID that we use to 
allow Members to log in to Members-only areas of the site and to ensure that 
each Member can view appropriate profiles from other Members and control who 
views his or her own profile</font></p></li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-top: 6"><font face="Arial" size="1">facilitate (or block) 
anonymous email communication between Members so that Members can exchange 
messages with potential matches without divulging their contact information</font></p></li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-top: 6"><font face="Arial" size="1">communicate with our 
Members regarding the status of their LDS LinkUp Membership and LDS LinkUp services.&nbsp; 
Note that Members can opt out of receiving promotional communications.</font></p></li>
</ul>
<h3><i><font face="Arial" size="1">Profile Information (excluding photos)</font></i></h3>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="1">
We use profile information users provide 
about themselves and what they are seeking in a match</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p style="margin-top: 6"><font face="Arial" size="1">in Members' personal profiles.&nbsp; 
Each Member can view or edit his profile at any time</font></p></li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-top: 6"><font face="Arial" size="1">to match specific profiles 
with searches done by other Members looking for potential matches with 
particular characteristics</font></p></li>

profiles with LDS LinkUp Agent criteria set by Members who want to be notified when 
new Members with particular characteristics join LDS LinkUp</font></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1">Please note that which Who 
New users can view a Member's profile is determined by a) whether the Member and 
the user 
are "connected," i.e., part of the same LDS LinkUp group, b) whether the 
user is a LDS LinkUp Member, and c) the "<a href="whonewfaq.asp#WhatisVisibility">Visibility Preference</a>" 
setting of the profile Member.&nbsp; Members can change their Visibility 
Preference at any time to exercise a measure of control over who views their 
profile.</font></p>
<h3><i><font face="Arial" size="1">Photographs</font></i></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1">
We use Members' photographs as part of their personal profiles.</font></p>
<h3><i><font face="Arial" size="1">Messaging Information</font></i></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="1">
We use the text and addressee information 
of invitation emails sent a) to invite people to join LDS LinkUp and b) between  </font><span style="font-weight: 400"><font face="Arial" size="1">
