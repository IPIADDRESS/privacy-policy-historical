  </p>
  <p><font face="arial" size="2"><strong>Other Meridian Affiliated Sites</strong></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="arial" size="2">LDSMAG.COM (Meridian Magazine) has established other “sister” Websites, including: LDSPRO.COM, LDSGETAWAY.COM, NEWTEMPLES.COM, MERIDIANMAGAZINE.COM/JOSEPH, MERIDIANMAGAZINE.COM/SHARON and uses these sites to promote professional services and resources for Meridian readers.

  <p><font face="arial" size="2"><strong>Collection and Use of Other Data
    </strong> </font></p>
  <p><font face="arial" size="2">Meridian Magazine will occasionally contract with a third-party service provider to help track and analyze usage and volume statistics on this site. The third-party service provider only collects general summaries of site activities. This information is used only to improve the site's quality. Any time this third-party service uses cookies or clear gifs, neither contain personally identifiable information, and are only used by us to help in tracking and analyzing site usage information.  </font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="arial" size="2"><strong>Cookies and Clear Gifs.
        </strong> </font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="arial" size="2"><strong>What Are Cookies? </strong> A cookie is a string of information that a Web site stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the Web site each time the visitor returns. Most major websites use cookies. Because the browser provides this cookie information to the website at each visit, cookies serve as a sort of label that allows a website to "recognize" a browser when it returns to the site. The domain name in Meridian cookies will clearly identify their affiliation with Meridian and, on rare occasion, its third-party service provider. </font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="arial" size="2"><strong>What Are Clear GIFs? </strong> Clear gifs (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help web site operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. The use of a clear gif allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the clear gif. It makes it easer to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited at a website. Any information gathered from Clear GIFs is strictly for Meridian Magazine's use and only helps determine how we can better serve our readers.  </font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="arial" size="2"><strong>You Can Control the Use of Cookies.</strong></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="arial" size="2">You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Meridian visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers by Meridian, its contractors, or third-party service providers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before linking to any of Meridian's Web sites. Certain features of Meridian's Web sites may not function properly without the aid of cookies, such as the Poll (to keep from stuffing the ballot box).

  <p><font face="arial" size="2">Internet Protocol (“IP”) Addresses. When users request pages from LDSMAG.COM for printing or to forward on to friends, our servers may log their IP address in order to improve site administration.
