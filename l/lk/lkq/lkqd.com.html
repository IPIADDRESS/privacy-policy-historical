<h4>HOW DO WE SHARE THE INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT?</h4>
<p>General<br>
Personal information which we collect for a particular purpose will only be saved and used for that purpose, unless you have agreed to allow us to use it for some other purpose, as described in this Privacy Policy.  We sometimes share non-personal information with third parties about our user base, but that information does not include any personally identifiable information.  Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not trade, share, rent, sell or give away information concerning you to third parties.</p>
<p>Our Affiliates<br>
We may share your personally identifiable information with legal entities that, directly or indirectly, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with, us.  These affiliates may use your personally identifiable information only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Our Service Providers and Strategic Partners<br>
We may disclose your personally identifiable information to our service providers and strategic partners.  For instance, we will disclose your credit card information to our financial service providers and banks for processing.  These third party service providers and partners will have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but may not use it for other purposes.</p>
<p>Enforcement<br>
We may disclose your personally identifiable information or otherwise use such information to communicate with you if required or permitted to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (i) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process or any governmental request; (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Likqid Media and its affiliates, licensors or licensees; (iii) enforce our applicable service agreements; or (iv) protect the personal safety or interests of Likqid Media’s employees and consultants, other users of the Website, or members of the public in urgent circumstances.  We may also disclose any of your personal information to law enforcement or other appropriate third parties in connection with criminal investigations, investigation of fraud, infringement of intellectual property rights, or other suspected illegal activities, or as otherwise may be required by applicable law, or, as we deem necessary in our sole discretion, in order to protect the legitimate legal and business interests of Likqid Media.</p>

Aggregated general information does not include any personally identifying information that could be used to contact or identify you.</p>
<p>Change of Control<br>
In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of the assets related to the Website, or if we experience some other change of control event such as merger, insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, we reserve the right to include any or all user-related information among the assets transferred to the acquiring company.  We cannot guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with any of these transactions will comply with all the terms of this policy.</p>
<h4>SECURITY</h4>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of, users’ information.  We restrict access to your personally identifying information to employees who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services and the Website.  Our servers are protected by firewalls and are physically located in secure data facilities to further increase security.  We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for mutual authentication, data encryption and data integrity.  While no computer is 100% safe from outside attacks, we believe that the steps we have taken to protect your personal information drastically reduce the likelihood security problems to a level appropriate to the type of information involved.  If you have any questions regarding which measures and techniques we use, feel free to contact us.  </p>

We aim to keep our information about you as accurate as possible and encourage you to promptly update your information if it changes.  You may, at any time, access your information to update, modify or delete any inaccuracies by accessing your account through the Website.  You may also request us to remove your account information from our databases and we will try to remove as much information as possible.  However, as we generally keep information related to past transactions for our records, we will not be able to completely remove your information.</p>
<h4>CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
<p>We may change our policy at any time by posting a new version of it on the Website.  We encourage you to check the Website regularly for information about revisions to this Privacy Policy.  In the event that we change our Privacy Policy, such changes will affect all of the information we collect after any such change.
