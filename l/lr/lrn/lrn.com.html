<p><span class="lt_blue"> <strong>Information Collection &amp; Use</strong></span><br> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<br>
<p><strong>Customer Web Sites</strong><br> LRN provides online knowledge, training, management and other services to employees of LRN's customers and others designated by LRN's customers to participate in LRN's programs ("Users"). LRN's customers are typically businesses or other organizations. LRN typically provides its services via Customer Web Sites that LRN creates, configures and hosts on behalf of customers. LRN operates its programs and collects and uses data about Users at the direction of, and in accordance with, the instructions of LRN's customers.</p>
<p>LRN's arrangements with its customers may require LRN to obtain certain personal information about Users, either from the customer or a User, in order for a User to access the online knowledge, training and other services provided on a Customer Web Site. Among other things, LRN may collect the following data: (i) User name; (ii) User identification; (iii) User password; (iv) User email address; and (v) User department(s) and location within the customer organization. LRN may also track the amount of time a User spends on the Customer Web Site, the applications the User employs, the self-tests the User performs, the User's performance on such tests, and other activities in which the User engages while the User is on the Customer Web Site.</p>
<p>LRN only uses personal information to provide feedback about a User's activity on a Customer Web Site. For example, LRN may use personal information to inform a User of his or her performance on tests, or the number of training modules that a User has used. LRN may also use personal information to send e-mails to a User, such as reminder e-mails that the User has not completed certain online courses.</p>
<p>LRN's arrangements with its customers require LRN to provide all User information in LRN's possession, including a User's personal information, directly to the customer with which the User is associated (i.e. the User's employer). If a User corresponds with LRN, LRN may keep a record of that correspondence. LRN may also forward correspondence to the customer with which the User is associated. LRN does not transfer any personal User information to any third party (other than to the LRN customer with which the User is associated) unless it is authorized to do so by the customer with which the User is associated , in connection with the services that LRN provides to the customer, or required to do so by applicable law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process.</p>
<p>We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information <em>only as necessary to provide</em> these services to us.</p>
