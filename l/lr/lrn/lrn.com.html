<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">LRN, The Legal Knowledge Company 
(“LRN”) is committed to protecting your privacy and earning your trust.&nbsp; 
<span style="COLOR: black">This Privacy Statement describes LRN’s privacy practices for 
the services LRN provides through web sites which LRN creates, configures and 
hosts on behalf of its customers and for the web site located at 
http://www.lrn.com.&nbsp; These practices conform to the requirements prescribed 
by the United States-European Union “Safe Harbor” arrangement for compliance by 
U.S.-based organizations with the provisions of the European Union’s Directive 
regarding the protection of personal information.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><span style="COLOR: black">Information Collection &amp; Use</span></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><u><span style="COLOR: black">Customer Web Sites</span></u></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="2">LRN provides online knowledge, 
training and other services to employees of LRN’s customers and others 
designated by LRN’s customers to participate in LRN’s programs (“Users”). LRN’s 
customers are typically businesses or other organizations.&nbsp; LRN typically 
provides its services via web sites that LRN creates, configures and hosts on 
behalf of the customer.&nbsp; LRN operates its programs and collects and uses 
data about Users at the direction of, and in accordance with, the instructions 
of LRN’s customers.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="COLOR: black">LRN’s 
arrangements with its customers may require LRN to obtain certain personal 
information, either from the customer or a User, in order for a User to access 
the online knowledge, training and other services provided on an LRN customer 
web site.&nbsp; </span>Among other things, LRN may collect the following data: 
(i) User name; (ii) User identification; (iii) User password; (iv) User email 
address; and (v) User department(s) and location within the customer 
organization.&nbsp; LRN may also track the amount of time a User spends on the 
customer web site, the applications the User employs, the self-tests the User 
performs, the User’s performance on such tests, and other activities in which 
the User engages while the User is on the LRN customer web site.<span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp; </span></font><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">LRN may use non-personal data that it 
obtains from Users, such as the amount of time Users spend on a specific portion 
of a web site, to <span style="COLOR: black">analyze trends, to gather data to 
benchmark best practices, and to monitor, improve and refine the functionality 
</span>of the system.&nbsp; LRN generally only uses personal information to 
provide feedback about a User’s activity on an LRN-hosted customer web 
site.&nbsp; For example, LRN may use personal information to inform a User of 
his or her performance on tests, or the number of training modules that a User 
has used.&nbsp; LRN may also use personal information to send e-mails to a User, 
such as reminder e-mails that the User has not completed certain online 
courses.&nbsp; LRN may also suggest which online courses are most suitable for a 
User.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">LRN’s <span style="COLOR: black">arrangements with its customers</span> may require LRN to 
provide all User information in LRN’s possession, including a User’s personal 
information, directly to the customer with which the User is associated (i.e. 
the User’s employer).&nbsp; If a User corresponds with LRN, LRN may keep a 
record of that correspondence.&nbsp; LRN may also forward correspondence to the 
customer with which the User is associated.&nbsp; LRN does not transfer any 
personal User information to any third party (other than LRN’s customer) unless 
it is authorized to do so by the customer with which the User is associated, or 
required to do so by applicable law.</font></p>
