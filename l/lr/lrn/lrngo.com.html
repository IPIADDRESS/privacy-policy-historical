										<div>Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over those other websites. The privacy policies of those websites may differ from LRNGO practices and are not controlled by LRNGO or covered by this Privacy Policy. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide while visiting such sites, and such sites are not governed by this Privacy Policy.

Excerpts from your profile may appear on the services of others (e.g., search engine results, etc.), and old/past profile information you have voluntarily entered may remain on these services until they update their data cache with any changes you have made to your profile. Your settings, how much personal information you elect to show (to members and publicly), the degree of connection or interests you have, the subscriptions other users may have, their usage, and other variables impact the availability of your profile and whether other users or visitors can view certain fields in your profile.  You are responsible for all of your choices and the accuracy and all updates regarding the personal information you post.</div><br>

										<h3 id="useof">2. Use of Personal Information Collected</h3><br>
										<div>LRNGO uses personal information only for membership management, service development, provision and improvement, maintaining a safe internet-use environment for our users, and the following purposes:</div><br>
										
										<div>Personal information is used for identity verification, purchase and payment, and delivery of services when a user is provided with paid premium services.</div><br>
										
										<div>Personal information is used for maintaining a history of services and for frequency analysis and statistics on service use, and other service analysis and statistics.</div><br>
										
										<div>Personal information is used to build and maintain a safe service environment, so that users can use LRNGO safely in the context of security, privacy, and minimal risk.</div><br>
										
										<div>Personal information is used for marketing and promotional purposes such as providing event information, participation opportunities, and advertisement information.</div><br>
										
										<div>LRNGO may use your personal information to process your service requests, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders and preferences, provide access to secure areas of the Website, recommend products or services that might be of interest to you, personalize your visit to our website, and to review, develop and continually improve the services we provide online. We may also use this information to prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our Website and to enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.</div><br>
										
										<div>We limit the use of personal information to the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy and for which the individual has provided implicit or explicit consent.</div>


										<h3 id="retention">3. Location, Retention, Period of Use and Disposal of Personal Information</h3><br>
										<div>LRNGO holds your personal information on servers located in the U.S.  If you choose to provide us with your information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States. The information we collect is subject to U.S. state and federal law. If  you are accessing LRNGO from other jurisdictions, please be advised that you are transferring your personal information to us in the United States. The server host’s role is limited to providing a hosting and storage service to LRNGO and to provide the necessary level of protection for the data stored.  If you do not want your personal information to be transferred to a server located in the U.S., you should not provide LRNGO with your personal information or use the Website.</div><br>
										
										<div>We retain personal information for only as long as necessary to fulfill the stated use purposes in this Privacy Policy or as required by law or regulations and thereafter appropriately dispose of such information.  If we have obtained a separate consent from a user regarding the personal information retention period or law imposes the obligation to keep the information for a certain period, the personal information will be kept safely during that period.</div><br>
										
										<div>When the purpose of collection and use of personal information has been achieved– as in the case of the withdrawal of membership, the end of service, or the voluntary request of a member to delete personal information originally provided by the user, the personal information is disposed of in a way that cannot be recovered. The information that has a certain retention period imposed on by the law shall also be permanently disposed of after all stated use purposes in this Privacy Policy have been fulfilled and after the expiration date.</div><br>
										
										<h3 id="disclosure">4. Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</h3><br>

										<div>LRNGO does not provide user personal information to third parties without prior consent of the user. However, LRNGO provides personal information only when the user directly agrees to providing personal information in order to use products or services of the external affiliate, and when the user is obliged to submit personal information in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations.  Personal information we gather is for internal use only and LRNGO will not authorize the release of this information to anyone outside LRNGO (except to third party service providers to who perform functions on our behalf but in such event personal information will only be shared to the extent reasonably necessary to perform their functions and they will not be authorized to use it for any other function), unless you have consented to such disclosure.</div><br>
										
										<div>If you breach our website terms of use, or if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, such as a lawful request from public authorities in regard to law enforcement or national security requirements, we may disclose your information to a relevant authority. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and security or credit risk. In other words, we may release the information we collect to third parties when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce our legal rights, to protect the rights and safety of others, or to assist with industry efforts to control fraud, spam or other undesirable conduct.</div><br>
										
										<div>We may release the information we collect to a third party if the information is provided to enable the third party to provide services to us, provided that the third party has agreed to use at least the same level of privacy protections described in this Privacy Policy, and is permitted to use the information only for the purpose of providing services to us. All communications of personal information to third parties will be done in a manner consistent with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our internal information security and Privacy Policy.</div>

										<h3 id="security">6. Personal Information Security Guidance</h3><br>
										<div>LRNGO is committed to commercially reasonable safeguards, best practices, and approaches to keep your information secure and prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information in our possession. We use various security measures to protect the information we collect, as appropriate to the type of information, including encryption, firewalls, and access controls. We store information you provide to us on a computer system located in a controlled facility with limited access and our company databases are accessible only by LRNGO. However, while we make reasonable efforts to prevent third party, non-affiliate access to personally identifiable information, all data transmission over the Internet is not 100% secure, and information disclosed online can potentially be collected and used, illegally or otherwise, by those other than the intended recipients. Therefore, despite these safeguards, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to our Website, or guarantee that information on our website will not be improperly accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. In view of the foregoing, we cannot guarantee or warrant that your personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to or accessed by parties other than those authorized under this Privacy Policy.</div><br>
										
										<div>We use reasonable measures to safeguard the security and integrity of your personal information through procedures and technology designed for that purpose. You should always safeguard your own personal information by protecting any passwords or other identifying information used to access your account with us and by safely disposing of any personal information that is no longer needed.</div><br>
