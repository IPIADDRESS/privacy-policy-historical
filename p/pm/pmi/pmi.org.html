<td valign="top"><span class="contentBody">PMI is recognized as the world’s leading project management professional association.  We strive to provide our members and non-member customers with the top products and services available and recognize that building a long-term business relationship with you depends a great deal on trust. This trust begins with our commitment to respecting as well as protecting your privacy and in furtherance of this goal PMI acknowledges that it respects the privacy rights of its members and customer and will comply with all applicable privacy laws in the countries in which PMI does business. <br><br></span><span class="contentBody">We've structured our web site so that, in general, you can visit PMI on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information.  Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (name, address, e-mail address, phone number, etc.) you can be assured that it will only be used to support your member/customer relationship with PMI.  Our membership application process, registration process for seminars, certification and educational programs, online bookstore, and Career Headquarters may request and/or require you to submit personal information.  However, you can be assured that any such personal information that you submit to PMI will be protected by industry standard security and management procedures and will be used only for the purpose for which it was submitted, unless you request or agree otherwise.<br><br></span><span class="contentBody">Our privacy statement covers five main areas: Awareness, Choice, Access &amp; Correction, Security, and Additional Web Site Issues. <br><br></span><span class="contentBody"><b>1. Awareness </b><br><br></span><span class="contentBody">PMI provides this Privacy Policy to make you aware of our privacy practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. <br><br></span><span class="contentBody"><b>What information we collect </b><br><br></span><span class="contentBody">On PMI’s web site, over the telephone, or through the mail, you are able to order products or services from PMI, apply for PMI membership, and register for seminars, courses, and certification. The types of personal information collected by PMI may include your name, your employer and job title, your contact and billing information for business and home (including telephone number and e-mail address), and your credit card information (if applicable).  In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services, we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products, and contact preferences.<br><br></span><span class="contentBody"><b>How we use the information </b><br><br></span><span class="contentBody">PMI uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service.  Specifically, we use your information to help you complete transactions requested by you, to communicate back to you, and to offer and update you on PMI services and benefits.  Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes. <br><br></span><span class="contentBody">As a benefit to PMI members and certificants, PMI will (at no charge) include your name and relevant biographical information in PMI Directories.  From time to time, we may also desire to contact you for market research purposes or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest.  You will not be included in any Directories nor will PMI reveal your personal information publicly or to any third party (except as stated below), unless we receive your explicit permission to do so.  For example, the PMI Membership application includes a question asking if you want your name included in mailing lists, PMI announcement lists and PMI Directories.  Your name will not be used for any such purpose unless you affirmatively request PMI to do so.  In addition, if at any time you would like to have your name removed from PMI lists and/or Directories, please follow the directions given below in the "Choice" section of this document to opt-out of such contact.<br><br></span><span class="contentBody"><b>Whom we share the information with </b><br><br></span><span class="contentBody">PMI will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others without your permission.  Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide to us with other PMI entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf to help us provide you with our products and services. Such PMI entities and/or business partners are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data and are bound by this Privacy Policy and applicable confidentiality agreements. <br><br></span><span class="contentBody"><b>2. Choice </b><br><br></span><span class="contentBody">PMI will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us for purposes other than for which the information was originally submitted, without your express permission.  We will also provide you the opportunity to inform us at any time if you choose to opt-out of partial or total contact from PMI and we will comply with such requests. This choice regarding communications from PMI may be offered on our membership and certification applications, registration forms or web pages, or at the bottom of on-line or off-line communications from us.  If you have any difficulty exercising your choices, please send your request to <u><a href="mailto:privacy@pmi.org" target="_top">privacy@pmi.org</a></u>.  You may also exercise your choices by contacting PMI by phone at (610) 356-4600, option 8 (Customer Service) or by mail at Project Management Institute, Inc., Four Campus Boulevard, Newtown Square, PA 19073, Attention: D. Murray, Privacy Officer.  Your permission will always be secured first, should we ever decide to share your information with third parties that are not acting on our behalf and not governed by our privacy policy. <br><br></span><span class="contentBody"><b>3. Access &amp; Correction </b><br><br></span><span class="contentBody">PMI strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate. We will provide you with access to your information, including making every effort to provide you with online or telephone access to your registration data so that you may review, update or correct your personal information.  To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections.  If you are a PMI member, you can access your personal information by going to the Members’ Area of the PMI web site and, after inputting your user ID and password, following the directions listed under “Change Personal Information.”  You may also request a change in your personal information by contacting Customer Service either by e-mail at <u><a href="mailto:pmihq@pmi.org" target="_top">pmihq@pmi.org</a></u>; or by telephone at (610) 356-4600, then select option 8 and following the instructions provided thereafter.    <br><br></span><span class="contentBody"><b>4. Security </b><br><br></span><span class="contentBody">PMI is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We use encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data online such as credit card information. <br><br></span><span class="contentBody">Your access to some services and content is password protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.  PMI will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. You should not disclose your user name and password to others. In addition, if applicable, you should remember to sign out of your PMI account or service at the end of each session. You may also wish to close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library. <br><br></span><span class="contentBody">Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, despite our best efforts to protect your personal information, PMI cannot completely ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or services. You transmit all such information at your own risk. However, once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.<br><br></span><span class="contentBody"><b>5. Additional Web Site Issues</b><br><br></span><span class="contentBody"><b>(a) Links to Third Party Web Sites</b><br><br></span><span class="contentBody">Links to third party web sites are provided solely as a convenience to you. If you use these links, you will leave the PMI site. PMI has not comprehensively reviewed all of these third party sites and does not control and is not responsible for any of these sites, their content or their privacy policies. Thus, PMI does not endorse or make any representations about them, or any information, software or other products or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to this site, you do this entirely at your own risk.<br><br></span><span class="contentBody"><b>(b)  How PMI Uses Cookies </b><br><br></span><span class="contentBody">A cookie is a piece of text asking permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. If you agree, then your browser adds the text in a small file. The general purpose of a cookie is to help a web site owner analyze web traffic on their site or allow an owner to tailor its web application for you based on your individual preferences. PMI’s web site uses only temporary “Session” cookies as part of the customer web navigation experience, tracking unique IDs and information you input for a particular web site session only.  You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)<br><br></span><span class="contentBody">PMI wants to ensure that you understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.  This practice is strictly enforced.  We are aware that a lot of people have concerns about cookies, but we believe that the benefit we both gain from their proper use is worthwhile. We value the relationships we have with our customers, so we respect these concerns.  PMI works to continuously improve the pmi.org web experience and personal data privacy policy and practices. <br><br></span><span class="contentBody"><b>6. Enforcement/Contact Information </b><br><br></span><span class="contentBody">If you have any questions or comments regarding our privacy practices, please contact PMI at <u><a href="mailto:privacy@pmi.org" target="_top">privacy@pmi.org</a></u>.  Douglas Murray, Esq., Associate Legal Counsel, is the authorized privacy officer for PMI.  PMI is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission.  Any disputes arising out of a breach of this policy will be submitted to and resolved by the privacy dispute resolution procedure set up by the Direct Marketing Association.<br><br></span><span class="contentBody"><b>7. Changes to this Statement</b><br><br></span><span class="contentBody">If there are updates to the terms of this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes and update the revision date listed on this document, so you will always know what information we collect online, how we use it, and what choices you have.  For material changes to this Policy, PMI will provide notification to affected customers.<br><br></span><span class="contentBody">Date:  March 23, 2005<br><br></span></td>
