<h1>PMI Privacy Policy</h1>
		
		<p>PMI is recognized as the world's leading project management  professional association. We strive to provide our members and customers with  the top products and services available and recognize that building a long-term  business relationship with you depends a great deal on trust. This trust begins  with our commitment to respecting as well as protecting your privacy and in  furtherance of this goal PMI acknowledges that it respects the privacy rights  of its members and customer and will comply with all applicable privacy laws in  the countries in which PMI does business.</p>
 <p> We have structured our web site so that, in general, you can  visit PMI on the web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal  information. Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information  (name, address, e-mail address, phone number, etc.) you can be assured that it  will only be used to support your member/customer relationship with PMI. Our  membership application process, registration process for seminars,  certification and educational programs, Marketplace, and Career Headquarters  may request and/or require you to submit personal information. However, you can  be assured that any such personal information that you submit to PMI will be protected  by industry standard security and management procedures and will be used only  for the purpose for which it was submitted, unless you request or agree  otherwise.</p>
 <p> Our privacy statement covers five main areas: Awareness,  Choice, Access &amp; Correction, Security, and Additional Web Site Issues.</p>
<p><strong>1. Awareness</strong></p>
<p>PMI provides this Privacy Policy to make you aware of our  privacy practices and of the choices you can make about the way your  information is collected and used.</p>
 <p> <strong>What Information We Collect </strong></p>
  <p>On PMI's web sites, over the telephone, or through the mail,  you are able to order products or services from PMI, apply for PMI membership,  and register for seminars, courses, and certification. The types of personal  information collected by PMI may include your name, your employer and job  title, your contact and billing information for business and home (including  telephone number and e-mail address), and your credit card information (if  applicable). In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously  improve our products and services, we may also ask you to provide us with  information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics,  experience with our products, and contact preferences.</p>
 <p> <strong>Information  Collected Through Technology</strong></p>
  <p>When you use any of our web sites or services, we or our  service providers may collect tracking information such as your browser type,  mobile device, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your  Internet service provider, and pages visited on the web sites. We use this  information for aggregate reporting. For example, we may want to know how long  the average user spends on our web sites or which pages or features get the  most attention. We use this information to make our web sites and other products  and services more useful to you; to provide you with more effective customer  service; to make the web sites or services easier to use by eliminating the  need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; to perform research and  analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and to  display content and advertising that are customized to your interests and  preferences.&nbsp; (See Section 5, Additional  Web Site Issues, for more information about technologies used to collect  information about user activity on PMI web sites.)</p>
<p><strong>How We Use the Information </strong></p>
<p>PMI uses your information to better understand your needs  and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to  help you complete transactions requested by you, to communicate back to you,  and to offer and update you on PMI services and benefits. Credit card numbers  are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes.</p>
 <p> As a benefit to PMI members and certificants, PMI will (at  no charge) include your name and relevant biographical information in PMI  directories. From time to time, we may also desire to contact you for market  research purposes or to provide you with marketing information we think would  be of particular interest. PMI will not reveal your personal information  publicly or to any third party (except as stated below), unless we receive your  explicit permission to do so. For example, the PMI membership application  includes a question asking if you want your name included in mailing lists, PMI  announcement lists and PMI directories. Your name will not be used for any such  purpose unless you affirmatively request PMI to do so. In addition, if at any  time you would like to have your name removed from PMI lists and/or  directories, please follow the directions given below in the "Choice"  section (Section 2) of this document to opt-out of such contact.</p>
 <p> <strong>With Whom We Share the Information </strong></p>
 <p> PMI will not sell, rent, or lease your personally  identifiable information to others without your permission. Unless we have your  permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you  provide to us with other PMI entities and/or business partners who are acting  on our behalf to help us provide you with our products and services. Such PMI  entities and/or business partners are governed by our privacy policies with  respect to the use of this data and are bound by this Privacy Policy and  applicable confidentiality agreements.</p>
<p><strong>2. Choice</strong></p>
 <p> PMI will not use or share the personally identifiable information  provided to us for purposes other than for which the information was originally  submitted, without your express permission. We will also provide you the  opportunity to inform us at any time if you choose to opt-out of partial or  total contact from PMI and we will comply with such requests. This choice  regarding communications from PMI may be offered on our membership and  certification applications, registration forms or web pages, or at the bottom  of online or off-line communications from us. If you have any difficulty  exercising your choices, please send your request to privacy@pmi.org. You may  also exercise your choices by contacting PMI by phone at +1-610-356-4600,  option 8 (Customer Care) or by mail at Project Management Institute, Inc., Fourteen  Campus Boulevard, Newtown Square, PA 19073, Attention: D. Murray, Privacy  Officer. Your permission will always be secured first, should we ever decide to  share your information with third parties that are not acting on our behalf and  not governed by our privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>3. Access &amp; Correction</strong></p>
 <p> PMI strives to keep your personally identifiable information  accurate. We will provide you with access to your information, including making  every effort to provide you with online or telephone access to your registration  data so that you may review, update or correct your personal information. To  protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify  your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections.  If you are a PMI member, you can access your personal information by logging  into My PMI with your user ID and password, following the directions listed  under "Change Personal Information." You may also request a change in  your personal information by contacting Customer Care either by e-mail at  customercare@pmi.org; or by telephone at +1-610-356-4600, then select option 8  and following the instructions provided thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>4. Security</strong></p>
 <p> PMI is committed to ensuring the security of your  information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data  accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place  appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and  secure the information we collect online. &nbsp;&nbsp;We use data encryption technology to help  protect against loss, misuse or alteration of your sensitive credit or debit  card information. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, which creates  an encrypted connection between you and our systems for the transmission of any  credit or debit card information you input online and we use encryption  protection for any payment authorizations for transactions we request through  any channel. Once we collect your credit card or debit card information, it is  stored encrypted on restricted-access computers that are not directly  accessible via the Internet. </p>
 <p> Any unauthorized access to or use of any of our web sites  and other products and services or to the information collected and maintained  by us should be immediately brought to our attention by contacting us via email  at <a href="mailto:privacy@pmi.org">privacy@pmi.org</a> or by writing to us at Project  Management Institute, Attn: Security, 14 Campus Blvd, Newtown Square, PA 19073.  We will investigate, and, if necessary, take action to halt any violation of  the security of your personal information of which we become aware. </p>
<p>Your access to some services and content is password  protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. PMI  will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an  unsolicited email. You should not disclose your user name and password to  others. In addition, if applicable, you should remember to sign out of your PMI  account or service at the end of each session. You may also wish to close your  browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others  cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a  computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a  library.</p>
 <p> Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be  guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, despite our best efforts to protect  your personal information, PMI cannot completely ensure or warrant the security  of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or  services. You transmit all such information at your own risk. However, once we  receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on  our systems.</p>
<p><strong>5. Additional Web Site Issues</strong></p>
  <p>(a) How PMI Uses Technology to Improve Your Web Site  Experience</p>
 <p> PMI  uses&nbsp; cookies and web beacons (described <a href="http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/fullnotice.mspx#cookies">below</a>), to collect information about the pages you  view, the links you click and other actions you take on our sites and services.  Additionally, we collect certain standard information that your browser sends  to every web site you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and  language, access times and referring web site addresses. We also deliver  advertisements&nbsp; and provide web site  analytics tools on non-PMI sites and services, and we may collect information  about page views on these third party sites as well.</p>
 <p> Most aggregate information is collected via cookies, web  beacons and other technical methods. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs), in  conjunction with cookies, are used to compile statistics about site usage. Web  beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of  Web sites or applications. We or our service providers use these technical  methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our web sites, such as the frequency  with which our users visit various parts of our web sites and to measure site  effectiveness or use of online products and services. We also use Web beacons  in HTML e-mails that we send our visitors who have agreed to receive e-mail  from us, to determine whether our recipients have opened those e-mails and/or  clicked on links in those e-mails. On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not  contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you  choose to furnish PMI with personally identifiable information, this  information can be associated to the data stored in the cookies or Web beacons.  These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either  directly to us or to our service providers. These technical methods allow us to  make our web sites and other products and services, and any e-mails you have  agreed to receive, more interesting to you. You may render some Web beacons  unusable by rejecting their associated cookies. </p>
 <p> We also use cookies to store, and sometimes to track, user  information. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or  other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this  information to us by, for example, registering or subscribing to our web sites.  A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web  server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie contains a unique  number that allows our web sites to recognize your computer. We use both temporary  and persistent cookies; a temporary cookie tracks visitor activity during a  session or visit and it expires when you close your browser. We use them to  provide continuity for your visit as you visit web site pages. Persistent  cookies allow us to keep track of your user name and password (if you are a  subscriber) so you don't have to re-enter that information each time you visit.  The Help function on most browsers contains information on how to set your  browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely.  However, if you don't accept cookies, you won't be able to take advantage of  various features on our Sites that are available to other visitors. </p>
  <p>PMI wants to ensure that you understand that accepting a  cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information  about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. This practice is  strictly enforced. We are aware that a lot of people have concerns about  cookies, but we believe that the benefit we both gain from their proper use is  worthwhile.
