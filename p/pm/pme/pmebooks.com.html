                         <p>Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the  Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the  Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete  confidence. <br>
                         We have  created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and  security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects information  from all end users of our Internet services (the "Services")-those  who access some of our Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors")  as well as those who may purchase Products and/or pay a monthly service fee to  subscribe to the Service ("Members")-what we do with the information  we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection  and use of such information. We request that you read this Privacy Policy  carefully. </p>
                         <p><br>
                           <strong>Personal  Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used</strong> <br>
                         Introduction.  Our company collects information in different ways from Visitors and Members who  access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites  accessible through our Service. We use this information primarily to provide a  customized experience as you use our Products and Services, and generally, do  not share this information with third parties. However, we may disclose  personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand  or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure  is required by law or other special cases described below. </p>
                         <p>&nbsp;</p>
                         <p><br>
                           <strong>Registration</strong>: </p>
                         <p>Members may be  asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our  Products or Services including name, address, telephone number, billing  information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer  being used to access the Services. The personal information collected from  Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account  (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third  parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances.  However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our  Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the  name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a  result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and the  partner to assess the results of the promotion. In this instance, personal  information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. We may also  generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information  Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the  names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this  aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear  on the Services. </p>
                         <p>&nbsp;</p>
                         <p><br>
                           <strong>Our  Company Partners and Sponsors</strong>: </p>
                         <p>Some products and services may be offered  to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent  contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members  some of these products and services, the partner may need to collect and  maintain personal information. In these instances, you will be notified before  any such data is collected or transferred and may decide not to use that  particular service or feature. Additionally, our partners may have  advertisements or co-branded Web Pages that are cosponsored by an affiliate,  independent contractor seller, or non-affiliated partner. Our company may share  non-identifying and aggregate information (except as described above), but not  personal information, with such partners in order to administer the co-branded  products or services offered. <br>
                         </p>
                         <p>&nbsp;</p>
                         <p><strong>Online  Shopping</strong>:  </p>
                         <p>At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or register to  receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new product and service  updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such  as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card  information. If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift  order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information  about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone number.  Our company has no control over the third parties' use of any personal  information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when  doing so. <br>
                           If you  order services or products directly from our company we will use the personal  information you provide only to process that order. We do not share this  information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete  that order. <br>
                         </p>
                         <p>&nbsp;</p>
                         <p><strong>Online  Advertisements</strong>:  </p>
                         <p>Our company may display our online advertisements. In those cases we share  aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors and Members collected  through the registration process as well as through online surveys and  promotions with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use this  aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements  or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells  us the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to  the audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have  collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to the intended  audience. Our company does not share personal information about its Visitors or  Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies.<br>
                         </p>
                         <p><strong>Responses  to Email Inquiries</strong>:</p>
                         <p> When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to our  company, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we  receive. Our company does not use the return email address for any other  purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party. <br>
                         </p>
                         <p><strong>Voluntary  Customer Surveys</strong>:  </p>
                         <p>We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We  encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us  with important information that helps us to improve the types of products and  services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and  responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by  a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary. <br>
                           We may take  the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys  and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may  have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as  gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or  other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to  improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and  products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared  with third parties. Promotions: Our company may offer polls, contests,  sweepstakes, drawings, games, content, or other promotions that are sponsored  by or cobranded with third parties. In certain instances, company may have to  supply personally identifiable information of the winners to the third parties.  Our company has no control over third parties' use of this information. <br>
                           You may be  entered in a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, simply by making a  purchase from us or by providing us with personally identifiable information  for some other reason or purpose. When the winning entries are chosen, only the  names and personally identifiable information of the winners are shared with  the entity administering the sweepstakes or contest, so that they can notify  the winners.<br>
                         </p>
