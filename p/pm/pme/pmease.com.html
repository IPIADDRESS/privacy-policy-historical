	<h1>Online Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>We at PMEase Inc. ("PMEase" or "we") respect your individual privacy.
       This privacy policy documents our adherence to the highest industry standards
       for the protection of your personal information. The policy is effective as of July 1,
       2008, applies to the site pmease.com and any other web sites of PMEase Software.
    </p>
    <h2>Why we collect personal information</h2>
    <p>We collect your personal information because it helps us deliver a superior level of customer
        service. It enables us to give you convenient access to our products and services. In addition,
        your personal information helps us keep you posted on the latest product announcements,
        software updates, special offers, and events that you might like to hear about.
    </p>
    <p>If you do not want PMEase to keep you up to date with PMEase news, software updates and the
        latest information on products and services click <a href="http://www.pmease.com/account">
        www.pmease.com/account</a> and update your personal contact information and preferences.
    </p>
    <h2>What information we collect and how we may use it</h2>
    <p>PMEase is the sole owner of the information collected on the site.
        PMEase may collect information at several different stages.
        First, we collect anonymous, aggregate information from all visitors to the site. This type
        of information is never linked to any personally identifiable information and is only used
        in the aggregate to generate statistical reports about the use of our site.
        Second, we require the submission of certain personally identifiable information
        (name and e-mail address) when you sign up for a user account. Registration allows you to
        activate/extend your QuickBuild service, generate your site licenses and otherwise access a broader range of online resources.
        The same items of personal information are required if you subscribe to receive our newsletter,
        or if you send an e-mail inquiry to our customer service department.
    </p>
    <h2>How we protect your personal information</h2>
    <p>PMEase takes precautions including administrative, technical, and physical measures
        to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as
        unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
    </p>
    <p>PMEase does not sell, rent or share customer information with any third party not affiliated
        with or owned by PMEase, except service providers who assist PMEase in such areas as data
        storage or direct mailing. PMEase will never give or sell your personal information to be used
        for the purposes of sending you unsolicited commercial offers (such as spam) from any third
        party. We may send you infrequent e-mail notices regarding PMEase products or services that
        may be of interest to you. You may choose not to receive these notices.
    </p>
    <p>To make purchases from the PMEase, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Firefox,
        Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. Doing so protects the confidentiality
        of your personal and credit card information while it transmitted over the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the
        Internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make
        sure you use a secure web browser like Firefox, Safari.
    </p>
    <p>If you have any questions about the security at pmease.com, you can
        <a href="http://www.pmease.com/contact">send a message</a> to Customer Service.
    </p>
    <h2>Integrity of your personal information</h2>
    <p>PMEase has safeguards in place to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to
        date for the purposes for which it is used. Naturally, you always have the right to access
        and correct the personal information you have provided. You can help us ensure that your
        contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by checking at

        with our sales and support agents by <a href="http://www.pmease.com/contact">sending a message</a>
        to us.
    </p>
    <h2>Cookies and other technologies</h2>
    <p>As is standard practice on many corporate websites, PMEase uses cookies and other
        technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where
        our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We also use cookies and other
        technologies to make sure that our online advertising is bringing customers to our products
        and services, such as QuickBuild. We use cookies and other technologies to study traffic
        patterns on our website, to make it even more rewarding as well as to study the effectiveness
        of our customer communications. And we use cookies to customize your experience and provide
