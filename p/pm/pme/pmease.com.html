    		<h1>Online Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>We at PMEase Inc. ("PMEase" or "we") respect your individual privacy.
               This privacy policy documents our adherence to the highest industry standards
               for the protection of your personal information. The policy is effective as of July 1,
               2008, applies to the site pmease.com and any other web sites of PMEase Software.
            </p>
            <h2>Why we collect personal information</h2>
            <p>We collect your personal information because it helps us deliver a superior level of customer
                service. It enables us to give you convenient access to our products and services. In addition,
                your personal information helps us keep you posted on the latest product announcements,
                software updates, special offers, and events that you might like to hear about.
            </p>
            <p>If you do not want PMEase to keep you up to date with PMEase news, software updates and the
                latest information on products and services click <a href="http://www.pmease.com/account">
                www.pmease.com/account</a> and update your personal contact information and preferences.
            </p>
            <h2>What information we collect and how we may use it</h2>
            <p>PMEase is the sole owner of the information collected on the site.
                PMEase may collect information at several different stages.
                First, we collect anonymous, aggregate information from all visitors to the site. This type
                of information is never linked to any personally identifiable information and is only used
                in the aggregate to generate statistical reports about the use of our site.
                Second, we require the submission of certain personally identifiable information
                (name and e-mail address) when you sign up for a user account. Registration allows you to
                activate/extend your QuickBuild service, generate your site licenses and otherwise access a broader range of online resources.
                The same items of personal information are required if you subscribe to receive our newsletter,
                or if you send an e-mail inquiry to our customer service department.
            </p>
            <h2>How we protect your personal information</h2>
            <p>PMEase takes precautions including administrative, technical, and physical measures
                to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as
                unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
            </p>
            <p>PMEase does not sell, rent or share customer information with any third party not affiliated
                with or owned by PMEase, except service providers who assist PMEase in such areas as data
                storage or direct mailing. PMEase will never give or sell your personal information to be used
                for the purposes of sending you unsolicited commercial offers (such as spam) from any third
                party. We may send you infrequent e-mail notices regarding PMEase products or services that
                may be of interest to you. You may choose not to receive these notices.
            </p>
            <p>To make purchases from the PMEase, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Firefox,
                Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. Doing so protects the confidentiality
                of your personal and credit card information while it transmitted over the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the
                Internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make
                sure you use a secure web browser like Firefox, Safari.
            </p>
            <p>If you have any questions about the security at pmease.com, you can
                <a href="http://www.pmease.com/contact">send a message</a> to Customer Service.
            </p>
            <h2>Integrity of your personal information</h2>
            <p>PMEase has safeguards in place to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to
                date for the purposes for which it is used. Naturally, you always have the right to access
                and correct the personal information you have provided. You can help us ensure that your
                contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by checking at

                to us.
            </p>
            <h2>Cookies and other technologies</h2>
            <p>As is standard practice on many corporate websites, PMEase uses cookies and other
                technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where
                our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We also use cookies and other
                technologies to make sure that our online advertising is bringing customers to our products

            <p>The cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. Allowing the
                pmease.com cookie to remain on your computer makes it easier for you to log in to and use
                the site. If you reject the cookie, you may still use the site, but you will be required to
                verify your identity at various points.
