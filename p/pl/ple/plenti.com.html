<p><strong>What information do we collect online and how do we collect it?</strong></p>
<p>The types of information we collect depends on which product or service you use.</p>
<p>Sometimes you give information directly to us, our <a href=" /onlineprivacystatementglossary" target="_blank">Business Partners</a>, or our <a href=" /onlineprivacystatementglossary" target="_blank">Service Providers</a>. For example, you might give us your name, account number, email, mailing address, phone number, or date of birth when you:</p>

<p>• the <a href=" /onlineprivacystatementglossary" target="_blank">IP Address</a> and information related to that <a href=" /onlineprivacystatementglossary" target="_blank">IP Address</a> (such as domain information, your internet provider and general geographic location);</p>
<p>• browsing history on our websites or apps (such as what you search for, the pages you view, how long you stay, and how often you come back);</p>
<p>• how you search for our websites or apps, from which website or app you came from, and which of our <a href=" /onlineprivacystatementglossary" target="_blank">Business Partners’</a> websites you visit;</p>

<p>We (and our <a href=" /onlineprivacystatementglossary" target="_blank">Service Providers</a> or <a href=" /onlineprivacystatementglossary" target="_blank">Third-Party Ad-Servers</a>) may also collect information made publicly available through third-party platforms (such as online social media platforms), through online databases or directories, or that is otherwise legitimately obtained.

<p>• with financial institutions or <a href=" /onlineprivacystatementglossary">Co-brand Partners</a> with whom we jointly offer or develop products and services (but they may not use your <a href=" /onlineprivacystatementglossary">Personal Information</a> - in particular your email address - to independently market their own products or services to you unless you consent that they can do so);</p>
<p>• in the context of a sale of all or part of the <a href=" /onlineprivacystatementglossary">American Express Family</a> of Companies or their assets; or</p>
