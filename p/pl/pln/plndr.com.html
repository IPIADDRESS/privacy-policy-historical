							Information Collection &amp; Use</h1>
						<p>
							<strong>Orders</strong><br>
							<br>
							We request certain personally identifiable information
							from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name,
							email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number,
							expiration date).
						</p>
						<p>
							We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have
							trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.</p>
						<p>
							While making a purchase from PLNDR.com, you are given the option to create a
							user name and password. This user name and password functionality offers our customers
							the ability to quickly and easily proceed through the check out process on repeat
							visits. We do not store your credit card information as part of this optional service.
							There is also the option to receive our Email Newsletter updates. If you choose
							to receive these you should expect weekly HTML newsletter content to arrive at the
							email address you provided with your purchase.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Surveys or Contests</strong><br>
							<br>
							PLNDR often provides you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys
							on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable
							information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary
							and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The
							requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping
							address), and demographic information (such as zip code).
						</p>
						<p>
							We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes and to send participants
							our HTML email newsletter.</p>
						<p>
							We sometimes run contests in conjunction with other websites or services. When we
							do so, any information you provide as a result of entering the contest or survey
							may also be provided to the affiliate but such practices will always be clearly
							marked at the point of entry.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong><br>
							<br>
							If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will
							ask you for your friend’s email address. Your friend will also be subscribed
							to our weekly HTML email newsletter. Your friend may contact us at <a href="https://www.plndr.com/plndr/membersonly/unsubscribe.aspx" target="_blank">www.plndr.com/plndr/membersonly/unsubscribe.aspx</a> to request that we remove
							their email address from our database.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Uses of Information<br>
							</strong>
							<br>
							We use the information we collect from you for billing purposes and to fill your
							orders. We do not store your credit card information. If you have created a Username
							and Password to the site or if you have signed up to receive our Email Newsletter
							updates we may use your purchase history to personalize special offers and promotions.
							These offers and promotions will be delivered to you in the form of an email newsletter.<br>
