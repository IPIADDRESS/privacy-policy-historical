disneyland.ca!&nbsp; If you establish a username on either one of these websites,
that username (along with your password) will provide you access to all of the
Walt Disney Internet Group ("WDIG") websites, including our ".com" websites,
such as disneyworld.com and disneyland.com.&nbsp; In a similar manner, if you have
established a username on any of our ".com" websites, that username (along with
your password) will provide you access to all of our ".ca" websites.</p>



<p>When you visit our ".com"
websites, the WDIG Privacy Policy that appears below will govern the
collection, use, sharing and retention of personal information that you provide
on those ".com" websites.&nbsp; However, if you are a resident of Canada, when you
visit one of our ".ca" websites (such as disneyworld.ca and disneyland.ca, and
other websites that have "Disney.ca" logos and post this "Special Notice to
Canadian Users" on their privacy policy pages), the WDIG Privacy Policy that
appears below will be modified with respect to personal information that you
provide on those ".ca" websites.&nbsp; The applicable modifications are:</p>


<ul>

	<li>A2 of the WDIG Privacy Policy ("Information Collected Through Technology")
	states that your IP address standing alone is not personally identifiable.&nbsp; For
	Canadian residents, however, we may consider IP addresses collected through use
	of our ".ca" sites to be personally identifiable.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the opt-out
	choices provided under A4 of the WDIG Privacy Policy with respect to our use of
	personally identifiable information will not apply to our use of your IP
	address to provide you promotional materials.</li>


	<li>A3 of the WDIG Privacy Policy states certain exceptions to the opt-out
	choices that you may make under A4 of the WDIG Privacy Policy.&nbsp; For personal
	information provided by Canadian residents on our ".ca" sites, the following exceptions
	under A3 will not apply:</li>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The exception for "Fulfillment Uses" of your personal information.&nbsp;
		Thus, if you have opted out of receiving promotional materials under A4, we
		will not send you such promotional materials simply because these materials accompany
		delivery of a product or service that you have requested.&nbsp; Of course, if you
		specifically request promotional materials, we will respond to your request by
		sending those materials to you.</li>



		<li>Certain aspects of the "Operational Uses" exception for use and
		sharing of your personal information.&nbsp; In this regard, if you so request by
		contacting us as provided in A7 of the WDIG Privacy Policy, we will limit
		application of the "Operational Uses" exception so that the only "Operational
		Uses" we make of your personal information are those required to service your
		member account with us and/or to facilitate transactions and requests that you
		make on our websites.</li>

		<li>Certain aspects of the "Non-Registered Transactions" exception
		for use of your personal information to send you promotional materials.&nbsp; In
		this regard, when you engage on a Non-Registered Transaction on one of our
		".ca" websites, you will be able to choose whether the member of The Walt
		Disney Family of Companies with which you conducted the transaction may use your
		personal information to send you promotional materials.</li>

		<li>Certain aspects of the "Sponsored Activities" exception for
		sharing your personal information with the sponsor of a Sponsored Activity.&nbsp; In
		this regard, for Sponsored Activities that occur on one of our ".ca" websites, you
		will be able to choose whether your personal information may be shared with the
		sponsor for purposes other than facilitating your participation in the
		Sponsored Activity.</li>

	</ul>

	<li>A4 of the WDIG Privacy Policy states that if you do not exercise
	your opt-out choices upon registration or initial log-in at our Web sites, it
	may take up to ninety (90) days for your opt-out choices to be fully effective
	and thus (a) you might continue to receive promotional materials from The Walt
	Disney Family of Companies for up to ninety (90) days, and (b) your personal
	information might continue to be shared with third parties for promotional
	purposes for up to ninety (90) days.&nbsp; Under these provisions, opt-out choices
	made with respect to personal information provided by residents of Canada on 	any of our ".ca" websites will be implemented so as to cause minimal delay
	consistent with commercially reasonable efforts.</li>

	<li>A6 of the WDIG Privacy Policy states that users of our websites
	may update their opt-out choices and contact information.&nbsp; In addition to this
	provision, residents of Canada who provide personal information on our ".ca"
	websites may request a copy of additional personal information that we have
	collected on these ".ca" websites and further may request that we correct any
	errors found in our records of that personal information.&nbsp; To make such
	requests, please contact our Member Services department as provided in A7 of
	the WDIG Privacy Policy.</li>

</ul>

<p></p><h1>WDIG Privacy Policy</h1><p></p>


<p>As a reminder, the WDIG privacy
policy was updated on November 6, 2003. If you registered prior to that date
and have not accepted the updated WDIG privacy policy, please refer to the
previous WDIG privacy policy.</p>

<p>Effective Date: 11/06/03</p>


<p>For over 75 years, The Walt
Disney Company has taken great pride in the relationships that it has developed
with its guests. In keeping with this tradition, we at the Walt Disney Internet
Group are dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal
information we obtain from you with care and respect. This Privacy Policy is
designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies and
principles. </p>

<p>We recognize the need to provide
additional protections for children who visit our sites. To read about our
privacy protections for kids under the age of 13, click here to read the Walt

What information does this Privacy Policy cover?</p><span class="themeText">A1. Except as specifically described below in A2 and A6, this Privacy Policy applies only to personally identifiable information collected on the Web sites where this Privacy Policy is posted and does not apply to any other information collected by The Walt Disney Family of Companies through any other means. This Privacy Policy applies to use and sharing of personally identifiable information collected on and after the date that this Privacy Policy is posted. However, for guests who registered on our Web sites prior to the date that this Privacy Policy is posted, we will apply this Privacy Policy to personally identifiable information associated with that account only if the guest accepts the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. Once the guest has accepted these terms and conditions, this Privacy Policy will also apply to personally identifiable information collected from that guest prior to the date that this Privacy Policy is posted. In a similar fashion, we will apply this Privacy Policy to personally identifiable information collected in the course of Non-Registered Transactions (as defined in A3 below) that occurred prior to the date that this Privacy Policy is posted, but only if the guest accepts the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

<p>As used in this Privacy Policy,
"The Walt Disney Family of Companies" includes The Walt Disney
Company and all of its subsidiary and affiliated entities, including companies
such as ABC and ESPN that generally do not offer their products and services
under the "Disney" brand name, as well as companies that generally do
offer their products and services under the "Disney" brand name. (At
times, our Web sites refer to The Walt Disney Family of Companies as "The
Walt Disney family of companies.") The Walt Disney Internet Group
(including its subsidiaries) is a member of The Walt Disney Family of
Companies, and is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "we,"
"us," "our," and "ourselves."</p>

<p>In keeping with the traditions of
The Walt Disney Company, we refer to customers of The Walt Disney Family of
Companies as "guests." When this Privacy Policy uses the term
"personally identifiable information," we mean information that identifies
a particular individual, such as the individual's name, postal address, e-mail
address, and telephone number. When other information, such as, for example,
consumer product preferences, or number of children, is directly associated
with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes
personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Personally identifiable information is sometimes referred to in this Privacy
Policy as "personal information." Finally, the terms of this Privacy
Policy are subject to all applicable laws.&nbsp; </p></span><p><a class="themeLink2" href="#">Back to Top</a></p><p class="themeTextBold"><a name="q2"></a>Q2. What types of personally
identifiable information do we collect about our guests?</p><span class="themeText"><p>A2. We collect several types of
personally identifiable information about our guests.</p>

<p>Information You Provide to Us</p>

<p>Much of the personally
identifiable information we receive comes directly from guests who are
interested in obtaining various products and services from us. Typically, this
information includes the guest's name, postal address, e-mail address, and
telephone number. We may also collect other types of information such as
gender, age, number of children, and personal interests, which we may associate
with personally identifiable information. If you purchase products or services
from us, we'll note, for example, credit card information, the type of services
or products ordered or purchased, and the date of the order or purchase. We
collect personal information when you register on, log on, or visit our Web
sites, including when you participate in activities on our Web sites, such as
sweepstakes, contests, games and promotional offers.</p>

<p>Information Collected Through
Technology</p>

<p>We collect information through
technology to make our sites more interesting and useful to you. For instance,
when you come to one of our sites, we collect your IP address. An IP address is
often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like
your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university.
Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we
also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which
our guests visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information
with personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>Our Web sites also use cookies.
Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer while
you are viewing the Web site. We and other companies use cookies for a variety
of purposes. For instance, when you return to one of our sites after logging
in, cookies provide information to the site so that the site will remember who
you are. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is
being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your
browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser
is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct
way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to
many features that make your Web experience smoother, like the features
mentioned above, and some of our services will not function properly.</p>

<p>Our Web sites use a variety of
technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are
small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites. We
also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Web
sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our
Web sites. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information
either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect
information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails
that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails
and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these
technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.</p>

<p>Many advertisements are managed
and placed on our Web sites by third parties. These companies are called
"network advertisers." Network advertisers who place advertisements
on our Web sites may also use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally
identifiable information when you click on or move your cursor over one of
their banner advertisements. You may not realize this information is being
collected. In some cases, we may have access to information from Web beacons
and cookies used by network advertisers on our sites and this information may
permit us to identify other sites that you have visited that are also
associated with the network advertiser. Finally, once you've clicked on an
advertisement and have left our Web sites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies
and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal
information will be handled on their site.</p>

<p>Information That We Collect from
Others</p>

<p>We may supplement personally
identifiable information that we have collected directly from our guests with
other information that we obtain from third parties and other members of The
Walt Disney Family of Companies. In addition, we may obtain information about
individuals who are not yet users of our Web sites or guests of The Walt Disney
Family of Companies. In addition, when we associate information that we obtain
from third parties or other members of The Walt Disney Family of Companies with
personally identifiable information that we have collected under this Privacy
Policy, we will treat the acquired information like the information that we
collected ourselves and, except as permitted by this Privacy Policy, the
information will not be shared with third parties.&nbsp; </p></span><p><a class="themeLink2" href="#">Back to Top</a></p><p class="themeTextBold"><a name="q3"></a>Q3. How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?</p><span class="themeText"><p>A3. As described in detail below,
The Walt Disney Family of Companies may use your personally identifiable
information in many ways, including sending you promotional materials, and
sharing your information with third parties so that these third parties can
send you promotional materials. (By "promotional materials," we mean
communications that directly promote the use of our Web sites, or the purchase
of products or services.) As outlined below in A4, you may "opt-out"
of certain uses of your personal information.</p>

<p>Disney Family of Companies,
Licensees and Co-Branding Participants</p>

<p>Personally identifiable
information collected under this Privacy Policy is shared among and used by The
Walt Disney Family of Companies for many purposes. For example, The Walt Disney
Family of Companies may use your personal information to send you promotional
materials about goods and services (including special offers and promotions)
either offered by The Walt Disney Family of Companies or offered by third
parties. These promotional materials may be sent to you by postal mail, e-mail
or other means. You may opt out of receiving these communications as provided
in A4 below. Please keep in mind, however, that when you purchase or request
products or services from The Walt Disney Family of Companies, promotional
materials may accompany delivery of that product or service. We refer to
sending you promotional materials in these circumstances as "Fulfillment
Uses" of your personal information. Because these promotional materials
accompany products or services that you have requested, your opt-outs for
Individual Disney Companies and The Walt Disney Family of Companies under A4
below will not apply to any of these Fulfillment Uses.</p>

<p>The Walt Disney Family of
Companies may also use your personal information for many purposes other than
sending you promotional materials. (We refer to all of these types of uses of
your personal information that do not involve the sending of promotional
materials as "Operational Uses.") For example, we may use your
information to complete transactions requested by you (such as your purchase of
a product or service offered on our Web sites), or to send you administrative
communications either about your account with us or about features of our Web
sites, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy. As another example
of Operational Uses, we may share your personal information with the Walt
Disney World © Resort telephone reservations center so that the reservations
center operators are able to respond immediately to your questions or requests
when you call, rather than asking you to provide your information a second
time. Because these uses of your personal information do not involve sending
you promotional materials, your opt-outs for Individual Disney Companies and
The Walt Disney Family of Companies under A4 below will not apply to any of
these Operational Uses.</p>

<p>In addition to using your
personal information within The Walt Disney Family of Companies, The Walt
Disney Family of Companies may share your personal information with companies
that offer products and/or services under brand names of The Walt Disney Family
of Companies. These companies are called "licensees." For example, a
company that publishes and sells books under the "Disney" brand would
be such a licensee. The Walt Disney Family of Companies may also share your
information with companies that offer products and/or services that are
co-branded using brand names of The Walt Disney Family of Companies. These
companies are called "co-branding participants." For example, the
Disney's Visa Card is co-branded with the bank that issues that credit card.
When The Walt Disney Family of Companies shares personal information with third
parties acting as licensees and co-branding participants, these licensees and
co-branding participants are restricted by contract from using the personal
information for any marketing or promotional purpose that is not related to a
licensed or co-branded product or service. Finally, to further protect your
privacy, these licensees and co-branding participants' use of personal information
shared with them under this Privacy Policy is subject to the same opt-out
rights (and limitations upon those rights) that apply to use of personal
information by members of The Walt Disney Family of Companies under A4 below.</p>

<p>You may engage in transactions
(such as purchasing products or services) without registering and logging on
our Web sites. These transactions may be either with us or with other members
of The Walt Disney Family of Companies. (We refer to all of these transactions
that you engage in without registering and logging on our Web sites as
"Non-Registered Transactions.") An example of a Non-Registered
Transaction would be when you purchase items from DisneyShopping.com without
registering and logging on that Web site. When you engage in Non-Registered
Transactions, the opt-out choices described in A4 below will not be available
to you, but your information will not be shared with third parties, and will
not be used by any member of The Walt Disney Family of Companies to send you
promotional materials other than the member involved in your transaction,
except as separately permitted by other provisions of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Finally, The Walt Disney Family
of Companies may take your personally identifiable information and make it
non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about
other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other
individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the
information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information).
Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this
Privacy Policy upon the right of The Walt Disney Family of Companies to
aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and The Walt Disney
Family of Companies may use and/or share with third parties the resulting
non-personally identifiable information in any way.</p>

<p>Third Parties Offering
Promotions, Products, or Services</p>

<p>Subject to your opt-out choices
(see A4 below), The Walt Disney Family of Companies may share your personal
information with selected third parties so that they can send you promotional
materials about goods and services (including special offers and promotions)
offered by them. (We call this type of sharing "promotional sharing"
or sharing for "promotional purposes.") When sharing your information
for promotional purposes, The Walt Disney Family of Companies attempts to
select only reputable companies that offer high quality products and services.
Moreover, The Walt Disney Family of Companies will not share your e-mail
address with third parties for promotional purposes, except when you consent to
such sharing in the course of your participation in a Sponsored Activity as
described below. When The Walt Disney Family of Companies shares your personal
information with a third party under any circumstance described in this
"Third Parties Offering Promotions, Products, or Services" section,
your personal information will become permanently subject to the information
use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be
restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing
of your personal information.</p>

<p>In addition to the promotional
sharing that is subject to your opt-out choices under A4 below, The Walt Disney
Family of Companies may also share your information when you engage in certain
activities on our sites that are sponsored by third parties, such as purchasing
products or services offered by a third party, electing to receive information
or communications from a third party, or electing to participate in contests,
sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored in whole or in part by a third
party. The Walt Disney Family of Companies may also share your personal information
when you respond to promotional materials from The Walt Disney Family of
Companies and authorize a third party to use your personal information for
purposes such as, for example, sending you additional promotional materials,
providing you a product or service, or entering you in a contest, sweepstakes
or game. (We refer to all of these activities and requests as "Sponsored
Activities.") When you participate in Sponsored Activities, you will
either be required or requested to agree that the sponsor or business associate
may use your personal information (including, in some cases, your e-mail
address) in accordance with the sponsor or business associate's privacy
practices. Since you will have consented to this specific instance of sharing
of your personal information, the opt-out choice for "Third Parties"
described in A4 below will not apply.</p>

<p>Companies That Facilitate
Communications and Transactions with You</p>

<p>Sometimes The Walt Disney Family
of Companies hires companies to help deliver products or services, like a
shipping company that delivers a package or a company that helps fulfill prizes
for a sweepstakes. In those instances, there is a need to share your
information with these companies. Sometimes The Walt Disney Family of Companies
also works with other companies who help either gather your information or
communicate with you. Your opt-out choices under A4 below will not apply to
sharing by The Walt Disney Family of Companies of your personal information
with any of these companies. Nonetheless, except as separately permitted by
other provisions of this Privacy Policy, these companies are allowed to gather,
receive, and use your information only for the purposes described in this
paragraph or as required by law.</p>

<p>Companies That You Previously
Authorized to Obtain Your Information</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, your
dealings with a third party may have authorized that third party to obtain your
personal information from The Walt Disney Family of Companies and to use that
information in accordance with the third party's own privacy practices and
policies. For example, in using an online shopping service (such as the
shopping services offered by Internet portals that refer the portal's users to
third-party merchants), you may have authorized that shopping service to obtain
from the service's participating third-party merchants (including The Walt
Disney Family of Companies) information about your purchases conducted through
the shopping service. In such circumstances, your opt-out elections under A4
below will not apply to sharing of your personal information by The Walt Disney
Family of Companies. Nonetheless, The Walt Disney Family of Companies will
provide such companies only the information that you authorized (except as
separately permitted under other provisions of this Privacy Policy). In the
example given above, the shopping service would be provided only information
concerning purchases you made from The Walt Disney Family of Companies through
that shopping service, and would not be provided any other information
concerning you, unless any additional sharing of your personal information were
separately permitted under another provision of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Purchase or Sale of Businesses</p>

<p>From time to time, we may
purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally
identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale.
In the event that we purchase a business, the personally identifiable
information received with that business would be treated in accordance with
this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so. In the
event that we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling
contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable
information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including any
amendments to this Privacy Policy). In light of this protection, your opt-out
choices under A4 will not affect our right to transfer your information to a
purchaser in these circumstances. The provisions of this paragraph will also
apply in the event that one or more businesses of any other member of The Walt
Disney Family of Companies are sold and personal information subject to this
Privacy Policy is transferred to a purchaser of those businesses.</p>

<p>Disclosures Required By Law and
Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Web Sites, The Walt
Disney Family of Companies and Others</p>

<p>Regardless of any opt-out choices
that you make under A4, The Walt Disney Family of Companies will disclose personal
information when it believes in good faith that such disclosures (a) are
required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or
subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest,
sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security,
including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or,
protect the safety and security of our Web sites, The Walt Disney Family of
Companies, and/or third parties, including the safety and security of property
that belongs to The Walt Disney Family of Companies or third parties.&nbsp; </p></span><p><a class="themeLink2" href="#">Back to Top</a></p><p class="themeTextBold"><a name="q4"></a>Q4. What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information?</p><span class="themeText"><p>A4. With regard to personal
information that you have provided under this Privacy Policy, there are three
separate opt-out choices available to you. These opt-out choices are the means
by which you give us, or decline to give us, your consent to use your personal
information for the purposes covered by these opt-out choices. Some of our Web
sites may not present you all three opt-out choices described below. Please be
assured, however, that if any one of these opt-out choices is not presented to
you on a Web site, personal information collected from you on that site will
not be used for the purposes covered by that opt-out choice. There are several
methods by which you can exercise your opt-out choices: (a) during the
registration process on our Web sites; (b) after registration, by logging on
our Web sites, clicking on our Privacy Policy links, going to a site's Guest
Services center (sometimes called a site's "Member Services" or
"Preference" center), and following the opt-out directions; and (c)
as described below in A6. Each of these opt-out choices is subject to the
exceptions described further below in this A4.</p>

<p>Your three opt-out choices are:</p>

<p>Third Parties: You may choose to
opt-out of receiving promotional materials from third parties. If you do not
choose this opt-out, The Walt Disney Family of Companies may share your
personal information so that third parties can send you these promotional
materials. Your opt-out choices for third parties are specific to the
particular Web sites where you make these choices. Thus, if you want to opt out
of all uses of your personal information covered by the "Third
Parties" opt-out, you must consistently elect that opt-out at each of our
Web sites where you either register, or log in and visit the Guest Services
center. If you want to make a change in your "Third Parties" opt-out
choices, you will need to make that change at each of our Web sites where you
previously made a different choice. Please bear in mind that this opt-out
choice for "Third Parties" will not apply to the licensees and co-branding
participants described above in A3.</p>

<p>The Walt Disney Family of
Companies: You may choose to opt-out of receiving promotional materials from
members of The Walt Disney Family of Companies, including the licensees and
co-branding participants described above in A3. This opt-out choice is found on
each of our Web sites. For your convenience, when you make a choice regarding
this The Walt Disney Family of Companies" opt-out at any one of our Web
sites, we will treat that choice as replacing any other choices regarding that
opt-out that that you may previously have made. Thus, if you want to make a
change in your "The Walt Disney Family of Companies" opt-out choice,
you can make that change by visiting the Guest Services center at any one of
our Web sites. Your election to choose this "The Walt Disney Family of
Companies" opt-out will not, however, override your consent to receive
promotional materials from a specific member of The Walt Disney Family of
Companies. As described in the following paragraph, you provide this consent
when you visit the Guest Services center of the Web site for a specific member
of The Walt Disney Family of Companies and choose not to opt-out of receiving
promotional materials from that specific member.</p>

<p>Individual Disney Companies: You
may choose to opt-out of receiving promotional materials directly from a
specific member of The Walt Disney Family of Companies. To do so, you must
visit the Guest Services center of the Web site for this specific member and
opt-out of receiving promotional materials from this member. However, if you do
not also opt-out of receiving promotional materials from "The Walt Disney
Family of Companies" as described in the preceding paragraph, you may
still receive promotional materials from this specific member of The Walt
Disney Family of Companies.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that any
opt-out choices you make will not apply in situations where (a) you either have
made, simultaneously make, or later make a specific request for information
from a member of The Walt Disney Family of Companies, (b) The Walt Disney
Family of Companies uses your personal information for either "Operational
Uses" or "Fulfillment Uses" (as described above in A3), (c) you
either have engaged, simultaneously engage, or later engage in either
Non-Registered Transactions or Sponsored Activities (as described above in A3),
or (d) The Walt Disney Family of Companies shares your personal information
under the provisions of A3 above with respect to "Companies That
Facilitate Communications and Transactions With You," "Companies That
You Previously Authorized to Obtain Your Information," "Third Party
Advertisers and Network Advertisers," "Purchase or Sale of
Businesses," or "Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help
Protect the Security and Safety of Our Web Sites, The Walt Disney Family of
Companies and Others."</p>

<p>Finally, if you do not exercise
your opt-out choices upon registration or initial log-in at our Web sites, it
may take up to ninety (90) days for your opt-out choices to be fully effective.
Our systems require time to update, and promotional mailings using personal
information shared before your opt-out may already be in process. Thus, you
might continue to receive promotional materials from The Walt Disney Family of
Companies based upon the personal information you have provided under this
Privacy Policy for up to ninety (90) days. For similar reasons, your personal
information might continue to be shared with third parties for promotional
purposes for up to ninety (90) days. &nbsp;</p></span><p><a class="themeLink2" href="#">Back to Top</a></p><p class="themeTextBold"><a name="q5"></a>Q5. What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?</p><span class="themeText"><p>A5.

contact information you gave us during registration (that is, your postal
address, e-mail address, or any other information that would directly enable us
to contact you), or modify your opt-out choices, by going to our member
services centers. Simply click on this link <a href="https://register.go.com/go/memberservices/home">https://register.go.com/go/memberservices/home</a>,

your opt-out choices by sending you an e-mail or other communication that
invites your response. Finally, you may unsubscribe from certain e-mail
communications by clicking on unsubscribe links in those e-mails.&nbsp; </p></span><p><a class="themeLink2" href="#">Back to Top</a></p><p class="themeTextBold"><a name="q7"></a>Q7.
