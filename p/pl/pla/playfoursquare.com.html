  LABS, inc. Privacy Policy</u></b></font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Foursquare 
  Labs, Inc. (“Foursquare”) knows that you care about how your personal 
  information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.  
  Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.  
  By visiting or using the Foursquare website, Foursquare’s services 
  and applications, and any other linked pages, features, or content offered 
  from time to time by Foursquare in connection therewith (collectively, 
  the "Service"), you acknowledge that you accept the practices 
  and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. </font></p>

  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Highlights 
  of our privacy policy:</font></p>
  <ul>
  <ul type="DISC">
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">For the most part, 
    information you submit to the Service will be available only to users 
    you designate as Foursquare ‘friends.’  ‘Friend’ relationships 
    on the Foursquare Service are bilateral, meaning each party must approve 
    of the friend linkage before it is enabled.  You can limit the 
    amount of your Foursquare Service activity that is shared with your 
    Foursquare friends through your privacy settings.  </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In some limited 
    cases, your Foursquare Service activity is broadcast to the wider Foursquare 
    community (e.g. showing your name in the ‘who’s here’ list after 
    someone checks in to a given place).  You can opt out of such broadcasts 
    through your privacy settings.  </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You can choose to 
    broadcast your Foursquare Service activity to third party services like 
    Facebook or Twitter, or you can opt out of doing so through your privacy 
    settings.  You have full control on what Foursquare Service activity 
    is broadcast to third party services such as Facebook and Twitter.</font></li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What Does This 
  Privacy Policy Cover?</font></p>

  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This 
  Privacy Policy covers Foursquare’s treatment of personally identifiable 
  information ("Personal Information") that Foursquare gathers 
  when you are accessing Foursquare’s Service.  This policy does 
  not apply to the practices of companies that Foursquare does not own 
  or control, or to individuals that Foursquare does not employ or manage.  
  In addition, the Service contains links to outside sources, both ones 
  we have added ourselves and ones that members have submitted.  
  While we attempt to provide links only to those sites that share our 
  respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content 
  or privacy policies of those sites.  We encourage you to carefully 
  review the privacy policies of any web sites you visit.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What Personal 
  Information Does Foursquare Collect?</font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The 
  information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve 
  our services and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile 
  that can be used to interact with other users through the Service.  
  In connection with the Service, we request and display some personal 
  information to other users and visitors of the Service, which allows 
  users to identify each other.  We collect the following types of 
  information from our customers.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Personal 
  Information You Provide to Us:</b></font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We 
  receive and store any information you enter on our Service or provide 
  to us in any other way.  The types of Personal Information collected 
  may include your name, user name, address, email address, phone number, 
  IP address, use information and browser information. <b> </b>

  The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing 
  you to interact with other users, improving the content of the Service, 
  customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with 
  you about specials and new features.  We may also draw upon this 
  Personal Information in order to adapt the services of our community 
  to your needs, to research the effectiveness of our network, and to 
  develop new tools for the community.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Personal 
  Information Collected Automatically:</b></font></p>
  <ul>
  <ul type="DISC">
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We receive and store 
    certain types of information whenever you interact with our Service 
    or services.  Foursquare automatically receives and records information 
    on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie 
    information, and the page you requested. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Generally, our service 
    automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency 
    of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that 
    indicate how many people watched a particular show.  Foursquare 
    only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, 
    and not in a manner that would identify you personally.  This type 
    of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts 
    of the Service or services so that we can make the Service appealing 
    to as many customers as possible, and improve those services.  
    As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information 
    to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site.   
    We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand 
    how often people use their services and our Service, so that they, too, 
    may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Foursquare 
    never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that 
    would identify you personally.</font></li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Email 
  Communications:</b></font></p>

  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We 
  may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Foursquare if 
  your computer supports this type of program. Foursquare uses this confirmation 
  to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and improve our 
  service.  If you do not want to receive email or other mail from 
  us, please indicate your preference during the registration process, 
  by making a modification on your account settings page. </font> <br>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>What 
  About Cookies?</b></font></p>
  <ul>
  <ul type="DISC">
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Cookies are alphanumeric 
    identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through 
    your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell 
    us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people.  
    Foursquare cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not 
    combine the general information collected through cookies with other 
    Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name 
    or email address is.  </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Most browsers have 
    an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your 
    browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication 
    of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each 
    new cookie in a variety of ways.  We strongly recommend that you 
    leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to 
    take advantage of some of our Service’s most attractive features.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ads appearing on 
    the Service may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who 
    may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your 
    computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile 
    information about you or others who use your computer. This information 
    allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements 
    that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy 
    covers the use of cookies by Foursquare and does not cover the use of 
    cookies by any advertisers.</font></li>

  </ul>
  </ul>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">SHARING OF YOUR 
  PERSONAL INFORMATION USING THE SERVICE</font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The 
  Service is primarily designed to help you share information, including 
  your location, with others.  This not only includes the information 
  that you provide directly to Foursquare, but also information that you 
  broadcast to third party services using the Service.  You can control 
  your information through your privacy settings accessible through the 
  ‘settings’ tab once you’re logged into the Service.   </font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Information 
  you submit to the Service will be available to users of the Service 
  that you allow to access such information (friends etc.).  Your 
  name and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results 
  across the Service network and those limited pieces of information may 
  be made available to third party search engines. This is primarily so 
  your friends can find you and send a friend request. People who see 
  your name in searches, however, will not be able to access your information 
  unless they have a relationship to you (friends etc.) that allows such 
  access based on your privacy settings.  </font> <br></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Please 
  remember that if you choose to provide personal information using certain 
  features of the Service, that information is governed by the privacy 
  settings of those particular features and, unless selected otherwise, 
  may be available to the wider Foursquare community or may be published 
  on the Foursquare website, which is subject to indexing by third party 
  search engines. Individuals reading this information may use or disclose 
  it to other individuals or entities without our control and without 
  your knowledge. Therefore, we urge you to think carefully about including 
  any specific information you may deem private in Shouts or Tips or other 
  user-inputted content that you create in the Service (location or otherwise).</font> <br>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">While 
  the Service does allow you to note your location at restaurants, bars, 
  stores (and so) throughout your community, at no time does Foursquare 
  ask you to provide your home address.  You should be aware that 
  if you or your friends add your home as a new venue in the Service database 
  and that information is published on the Service (for example, via a 
  user checking in to that home venue), that information may be published 
  by third parties without our control.</font></p>

  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The 
  Service allows you to connect with certain third party services (e.g., 
  Twitter, Facebook and other similar services).  When you broadcast 
  information to such third party services, such information is no longer 
  under the control of Foursquare and is subject to the terms of use and 
  privacy policies of such third parties.  Additionally, certain 
  information may be made available to third party developers using our 
  Application Programming Interface (“API”) if you or your ‘friend’ 
  use third party applications developed by such third party developers.  
  Use of third party applications developed using our API are subject 
  to the terms of use and privacy policies of such third party developers.  
  You should be aware that such third party applications may expose user 
  locations in broad and creative ways and some third party services may 
  permit you to make your information publicly available and accessible 
  by everyone on the Internet.  You can control whether your Foursquare 
  activity is broadcast to third parties through your privacy settings.</font> <br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Will Foursquare 
  Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Personal 
  Information about our customers is an integral part of our business.  
  We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone.  
  We may share your Personal Information only as described below.  </font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>Affiliated 
  Businesses We Do Not Control</i>: We are affiliated with a variety of 
  businesses and work closely with them.  In certain situations, 
  these businesses sell items or provide promotions to you through Foursquare’s 
  Service.  In other situations, Foursquare provides services, or 
  sells products jointly with affiliated businesses.  You can easily 
  recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, 
  and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such 
  transactions with that affiliated business, if you have agreed to be 
  solicited by marketing partners during the registration process.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>Agents</i>: 
  We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf 
  and need to share your information with them to provide products or 
  services to you.    Unless we tell you differently, Foursquare’s 
  agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with 
  them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our 
  sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.</font></p>

  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>User 
  profiles: </i>User profile information including user name, Twitter 
  account name, Facebook account name, and other information you enter 
  may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within 
  the Service. Users’ email addresses will not be directly revealed 
  to other users by Company, except, when the user is "connected" 
  to another user as a Friend and chooses to email them from within the 
  Service. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>Communication 
  in response to User Submissions: </i>
  As part of the Service, you will receive from Company email and other 
  communication relating to your User Submissions. You acknowledge and 
  agree that by posting such User Submissions, Company may send you email 
  and other communication that it determines in its sole discretion relate 
  to your User Submissions. The Company also will use your email to send 
  you updates on when your foursquare friends check-in, when you receive 
  a new friend request, and a foursquare newsletter – however, you can 
  opt out of all of these communications on your Settings page.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>Promotional 
  Offers</i>: As part of the Service you may be exposed to offers on behalf 
  of other businesses.  However, when we do so, we do not give the 
  other business your name and address.  </font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>Invitations:  </i>

  When you invite someone to join the Foursquare community, please be 
  aware that we will disclose your real name, as an invitation containing 
  your name will be sent to the email address of the person you wish to 
  invite. This information is necessary to make sure your invitee knows 
  who has contacted them. To build a community based on trust and empathy, 
  we feel this disclosure is necessary.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>Business 
  Transfers</i>: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.  
  In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one 
  of the business assets that is transferred.  Moreover, if Foursquare, 
  or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely 
  event that Foursquare goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer 
  information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired 
  by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and 
  that any acquirer of Foursquare may continue to use your Personal Information 
  as set forth in this policy.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>Protection 
  of Foursquare and Others</i>: We may release Personal Information when 
  we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that 
  law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or 
  protect the rights, property, or safety of Foursquare, our employees, 
  our users, or others.  This includes exchanging information with 
  other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk 
  reduction.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>With 
  Your Consent</i>: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when 
  your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will 
  be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>Non-Private 
  or Non-Personal Information:</i> For clarity, we may share or disclose 
  your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, 
  such as the number of users who checked in at a particular location 
  (even if only one did).</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Is Personal 
  Information About me Secure?</font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Your 
  Foursquare account Personal Information is protected by a password for 
  your privacy and security.  You need to prevent unauthorized access 
  to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting 
  your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and 
  browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Foursquare 
  endeavors to protect user information to ensure that user account information

  at any time. </font></p>
