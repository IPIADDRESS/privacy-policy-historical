              maintain the privacy and confidentiality of our visitors. </p>
            <p>Web Service Purpose and Overview of Policy<br>

              visitors that we operate under the following set of privacy principles.

            <h1>Notice of Privacy Practices</h1>
            <p>THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE
              USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION.<br>
              PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.</p>

              Privacy Officer:<br>
              JANE GENTRY<br>
              <br>
              1. <strong>Purpose</strong><br>
              We understand that medical information about you and your health
              is personal and we are committed to protecting that information.
              We create a record of the care and services you receive at the
              Medical Practice in order to provide you with quality care and
              to comply with certain legal requirements.</p>
            <p>This Notice of Privacy Practices describes how we may use and
              disclose medical information about you, including demographic information,
              that may identify you and your related health care services to
              carry out your treatment, obtain payment for our services, to perform
              the daily health care operations of this practice and for other
              purposes that are permitted or required by law. This notice also
              describes your rights to access and control your medical information.</p>
            <p>We are required to abide by the terms of this Notice of Privacy
              Practices.</p>
            <p>2. <strong>Written Acknowledgement</strong><br>
              You will be asked to sign a written statement acknowledging that
                you have received a copy of this notice. The acknowledgement
                only serves to create a record that you have received a copy
                of the notice.</p>
            <p>3. <strong>Changes to this Notice</strong><br>
              We may change the terms of our Notice, at any time. The new Notice
                will be effective for all medical information that we maintain
                at that time. Upon your request, we will provide you with any
                revised Notice of Privacy Practices. To request a revised copy,
                you may call our office and request that a revised copy be sent

            <p>4. <strong>How We May Use and Disclose Medical Information about
                You</strong><br>
              The following categories describe the different ways that the Medical
              Practice may use and disclose your medical information and a few
              examples of what we mean. These examples are not meant to describe
              every circumstance, but to give you an idea of the types of uses
              and disclosures that may be made by our office. Other uses and
              disclosures of your medical information that are not listed or
              described below will be made only with your written authorization.
              You may revoke this authorization, at any time, in writing, but
              it will not apply to any actions we have already taken.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>For your treatment: Your medical information may be used and
                disclosed by us for the purpose of providing medical treatment
                to you or for another health care provider providing medical
                treatment to you. For example, a nurse obtains treatment information
                about you and documents it in your medical record and the physician
                has access to that information. If you require an x-ray to be
                taken, the x-ray technician also has access to your medical information.
                In addition, your medical information may be provided to a physician
                to whom you have been referred or are otherwise seeing to ensure
                that the physician has the necessary information to diagnose
                or treat you.</li>
              <li>To obtain payment for our services: Your medical information
                may be used and disclosed by us to obtain payment for your health
                care bills or to assist another health care provider in obtaining
                payment for their health care bills. For example, we may submit
                requests for payment to your health insurance company for the
                medical services that you received. We may also disclose your
                medical information as required by your health insurance plan
                before it approves or pays for the health care services we recommend
                for you.</li>
              <li>For our health care operations: Your medical information may
                be used and disclosed by us to support our daily operations.
                These health care operation activities include, but are not limited
                to, quality assessment activities, employee review activities,
                training of medical students, licensing, fundraising activities,
                and conducting or arranging for other business activities. For
                example, we may disclose your medical information to medical
                school students that see patients at our office. We may also
                use the medical information we have to determine where we can
                make improvements in the services and care we offer.</li>
              <li>For the health care operations of other health care providers:
                We may also use your medical information to assist another health
                care provider treating you with its quality improvement activities,
                evaluation of the health care professionals or for fraud and
                abuse detection or compliance. For example, we may disclose your
                medical information to another physician to assist in its efforts
                to make sure it is complying with all rules related to operating
                a medical practice.</li>
              <li>For appointment reminders: We may use or disclose your medical
                information to contact you to remind you of your appointment,
                by mail or by telephone. Our message will include the name of
                our practice or the name of our physician as well as the date
                and time for your appointment or a reminder that an appointment
                needs to be scheduled.</li>
              <li> To provide you with treatment alternatives: We may use or
                disclose your medical information to provide you with information
                about treatment alternatives or other health-related benefits
                and services that may be of interest to you. For example, we
                may contact several home health agencies or physical therapy
                providers to discuss the services they provide when we have a
                patient who needs these services.</li>
              <li>To our business associates: We will share your medical information
                with third party “business associates” that perform
                various activities (e.g., billing, transcription services) for
                the practice. Whenever an arrangement between our office and
                a business associate involves the use or disclosure of your medical
                information, we will have a written agreement that contains terms
                that will protect the privacy of your medical information. For
                example, the Medical Practice may hire a billing company to submit
                claims to your health care insurer. Your medical information
                will be disclosed to this billing company, but a written agreement
                between our office and the billing company will prohibit the
                billing company from using your medical information in any way
                other than what we allow.</li>
              <li> For fundraising activities: We may use or disclose your demographic
                information and the dates that you received treatment from us
                in order to contact you for fundraising activities supported
                by our office. If you do not want to receive these materials,
                please contact the Privacy Officer and request that these fundraising
                materials not be sent to you.</li>
              <li>Others involved in your health care: Unless you object, we
                may disclose to a member of your family, a relative, a close
                friend or any other person you identify, your medical information
                that directly relates to that person’s involvement in your
                health care. If you are unable to agree or object to such a disclosure,
                we may disclose such information as necessary if we determine
                that it is in your best interest based on our professional judgment.
                We may use or disclose your medical information to notify a family
                member or any other person that is responsible for your care
                of your location and general health condition. Finally, we may
                use or disclose your medical information to an authorized public
                or private entity to assist in (1) disaster relief efforts and
                (2) to coordinate uses and disclosures to family or other individuals
                involved in your health care.</li>
              <li>As required by law: We may use or disclose your medical information
                to the extent that the use or disclosure is required by law.
                The use or disclosure will be made in compliance with the law
                and will be limited to the relevant requirements of the law.
                You will be notified, as required by law, of any such uses or
                disclosures.</li>
              <li>For public health activities: We may disclose your medical
                information for public health activities and purposes to a public
                health authority that is permitted by law to collect or receive
                the information. The disclosure will be made for the purpose
                of controlling disease, injury or disability. We may also disclose

            <p>5. <strong>Your Rights</strong><br>
              Following is a statement of your rights with respect to your medical
                information and a brief description of how you may exercise these
                rights.</p>
            <p>You have the right to inspect and copy your medical information.
              You may inspect and obtain a copy of your medical information that
              we maintain. The information may contain medical and billing records
              and any other records that we use for making decisions about you.
              However, under federal law, you may not inspect or copy the following
              records: psychotherapy notes; information compiled related to a
              civil, criminal, or administrative action; and medical information
              that is subject to law that prohibits access to medical information
              in certain circumstances. We may deny your request to inspect your
              medical information. In some circumstances, you may have a right
              to have this decision reviewed. Please contact our Privacy Officer
              if you have questions about access to your medical record.</p>
            <p>You have the right to request a restriction of your medical information.
              This means you may ask us not to use or disclose any part of your
              medical information for the purposes of treatment, payment or health
              care operations. You may also request that any part of your medical
              information not be disclosed to family members or friends who may
              be involved in your care. Your request must state the specific
              restriction requested and to whom you want the restriction to apply.</p>
            <p>We are not required to agree to your request. If we agree to the
              requested restriction, we may not use or disclose your medical
              information in violation of that restriction unless it is needed
              to provide emergency treatment or unless we otherwise notify you
              that we can no longer honor your request. With this in mind, please
              discuss any restriction you wish to request with your physician.
              Please request all restrictions in writing to our Privacy Officer.</p>
            <p>You have the right to request that we accommodate you in communicating
              confidential medical information. We will accommodate reasonable
              requests, but we may condition this accommodation by asking you
              for information as to how payment will be handled or other information
              necessary to honor your request. Please make this request in writing
              to our Privacy Officer.</p>
            <p>You may have the right to ask us to amend your medical information.
              You may request an amendment of your medical information as long
              as we maintain this information. In certain cases, we may deny
              your request for an amendment. If we deny your request for amendment,
              you have the right to file a disagreement with us and we may respond
              in writing to you. Please contact our Privacy Officer if you have
              questions about amending your medical record.</p>
            <p>You have the right to receive an accounting of certain disclosures
              we have made, if any, of your medical information. This right applies
              to disclosures for purposes other than treatment, payment or health
              care operations as described in this Notice of Privacy Practices.
              It excludes disclosures we may have made pursuant to your authorization
              (permission), made directly to you, to family members or friends
              involved in your care, or for appointment notification purposes.
              You have the right to receive specific information regarding these
              disclosures that occurred after April 14, 2003. You may request
              a shorter timeframe. The right to receive this information is subject
              to certain exceptions, restrictions and limitations.</p>
            <p>You have the right to obtain a paper copy of this notice from
              us. If you would like a paper copy of this notice, please request
              one from our Privacy Officer or request one when you are in our
              offices.</p>
            <p>6. <strong>Complaints</strong>.<br>
              You may complain to us if you believe your privacy rights have
                been violated by us. To file a complaint, please contact our
                Privacy Officer who will be happy to assist you. You may file
                a complaint with us by notifying our Privacy Officer of your
                complaint. We will not retaliate against you for filing a complaint.

                the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</p>
