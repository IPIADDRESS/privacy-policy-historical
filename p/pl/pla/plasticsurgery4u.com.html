                <p>Web Service Purpose and Overview of Policy<br>

                <h1>Notice of Privacy Practices</h1>
                <p>THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE
                  USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION.<br>

                <p>If you have any questions about this Notice, please contact our
                  Privacy Officer:<br>
                  JANE GENTRY<br>
  <br>
                  1. <strong>Purpose</strong><br>
                  We understand that medical information about you and your health
                  is personal and we are committed to protecting that information.
                  We create a record of the care and services you receive at the

                  to comply with certain legal requirements.</p>
                <p>This Notice of Privacy Practices describes how we may use and
                  disclose medical information about you, including demographic information,
                  that may identify you and your related health care services to
                  carry out your treatment, obtain payment for our services, to perform
                  the daily health care operations of this practice and for other
                  purposes that are permitted or required by law. This notice also
                  describes your rights to access and control your medical information.</p>
                <p>We are required to abide by the terms of this Notice of Privacy
                  Practices.</p>
                <p>2. <strong>Written Acknowledgement</strong><br>
                  You will be asked to sign a written statement acknowledging that
                  you have received a copy of this notice. The acknowledgement
                  only serves to create a record that you have received a copy
                  of the notice.</p>
                <p>3. <strong>Changes to this Notice</strong><br>
                  We may change the terms of our Notice, at any time. The new Notice

                  at that time. Upon your request, we will provide you with any
                  revised Notice of Privacy Practices. To request a revised copy,

                  next appointment. </p>
                <p>4. <strong>How We May Use and Disclose Medical Information about
                  You</strong><br>
                  The following categories describe the different ways that the Medical
                  Practice may use and disclose your medical information and a few
                  examples of what we mean. These examples are not meant to describe
                  every circumstance, but to give you an idea of the types of uses
                  and disclosures that may be made by our office. Other uses and
                  disclosures of your medical information that are not listed or
                  described below will be made only with your written authorization.
                  You may revoke this authorization, at any time, in writing, but
                  it will not apply to any actions we have already taken.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>For your treatment: Your medical information may be used and
                    disclosed by us for the purpose of providing medical treatment
                    to you or for another health care provider providing medical
                    treatment to you. For example, a nurse obtains treatment information
                    about you and documents it in your medical record and the physician
                    has access to that information. If you require an x-ray to be
                    taken, the x-ray technician also has access to your medical information.
                    In addition, your medical information may be provided to a physician
                    to whom you have been referred or are otherwise seeing to ensure
                    that the physician has the necessary information to diagnose
                    or treat you.</li>
                  <li>To obtain payment for our services: Your medical information
                    may be used and disclosed by us to obtain payment for your health
                    care bills or to assist another health care provider in obtaining
                    payment for their health care bills. For example, we may submit
                    requests for payment to your health insurance company for the
                    medical services that you received. We may also disclose your
                    medical information as required by your health insurance plan
                    before it approves or pays for the health care services we recommend
                    for you.</li>
                  <li>For our health care operations: Your medical information may
                    be used and disclosed by us to support our daily operations.
                    These health care operation activities include, but are not limited
                    to, quality assessment activities, employee review activities,
                    training of medical students, licensing, fundraising activities,
                    and conducting or arranging for other business activities. For
                    example, we may disclose your medical information to medical
                    school students that see patients at our office. We may also
                    use the medical information we have to determine where we can
                    make improvements in the services and care we offer.</li>
                  <li>For the health care operations of other health care providers:
                    We may also use your medical information to assist another health
                    care provider treating you with its quality improvement activities,
                    evaluation of the health care professionals or for fraud and
                    abuse detection or compliance. For example, we may disclose your
                    medical information to another physician to assist in its efforts
                    to make sure it is complying with all rules related to operating
                    a medical practice.</li>
                  <li>For appointment reminders: We may use or disclose your medical
                    information to contact you to remind you of your appointment,
                    by mail or by telephone. Our message will include the name of
                    our practice or the name of our physician as well as the date
                    and time for your appointment or a reminder that an appointment
                    needs to be scheduled.</li>
                  <li> To provide you with treatment alternatives: We may use or
                    disclose your medical information to provide you with information
                    about treatment alternatives or other health-related benefits
                    and services that may be of interest to you. For example, we
                    may contact several home health agencies or physical therapy
                    providers to discuss the services they provide when we have a
                    patient who needs these services.</li>
                  <li>To our business associates: We will share your medical information
                    with third party âbusiness associatesâ that perform
                    various activities (e.g., billing, transcription services) for
                    the practice. Whenever an arrangement between our office and
                    a business associate involves the use or disclosure of your medical
                    information, we will have a written agreement that contains terms
                    that will protect the privacy of your medical information. For
                    example, the Medical Practice may hire a billing company to submit
                    claims to your health care insurer. Your medical information
                    will be disclosed to this billing company, but a written agreement
                    between our office and the billing company will prohibit the
                    billing company from using your medical information in any way
                    other than what we allow.</li>
                  <li> For fundraising activities: We may use or disclose your demographic
                    information and the dates that you received treatment from us
                    in order to contact you for fundraising activities supported
                    by our office. If you do not want to receive these materials,
                    please contact the Privacy Officer and request that these fundraising
                    materials not be sent to you.</li>

                    that directly relates to that personâs involvement in your
                    health care. If you are unable to agree or object to such a disclosure,

                    that it is in your best interest based on our professional judgment.

                  Following is a statement of your rights with respect to your medical
                  information and a brief description of how you may exercise these
                  rights.</p>
                <p>You have the right to inspect and copy your medical information.
                  You may inspect and obtain a copy of your medical information that
                  we maintain. The information may contain medical and billing records
                  and any other records that we use for making decisions about you.
                  However, under federal law, you may not inspect or copy the following
                  records: psychotherapy notes; information compiled related to a
                  civil, criminal, or administrative action; and medical information
                  that is subject to law that prohibits access to medical information
                  in certain circumstances. We may deny your request to inspect your
                  medical information. In some circumstances, you may have a right
                  to have this decision reviewed. Please contact our Privacy Officer
                  if you have questions about access to your medical record.</p>
                <p>You have the right to request a restriction of your medical information.
                  This means you may ask us not to use or disclose any part of your
                  medical information for the purposes of treatment, payment or health
                  care operations. You may also request that any part of your medical
                  information not be disclosed to family members or friends who may
                  be involved in your care. Your request must state the specific
                  restriction requested and to whom you want the restriction to apply.</p>
                <p>We are not required to agree to your request. If we agree to the
                  requested restriction, we may not use or disclose your medical
                  information in violation of that restriction unless it is needed
                  to provide emergency treatment or unless we otherwise notify you
                  that we can no longer honor your request. With this in mind, please
                  discuss any restriction you wish to request with your physician.
                  Please request all restrictions in writing to our Privacy Officer.</p>
                <p>You have the right to request that we accommodate you in communicating
                  confidential medical information. We will accommodate reasonable
                  requests, but we may condition this accommodation by asking you
                  for information as to how payment will be handled or other information
                  necessary to honor your request. Please make this request in writing
                  to our Privacy Officer.</p>
                <p>You may have the right to ask us to amend your medical information.
                  You may request an amendment of your medical information as long
                  as we maintain this information. In certain cases, we may deny
                  your request for an amendment. If we deny your request for amendment,
                  you have the right to file a disagreement with us and we may respond
                  in writing to you. Please contact our Privacy Officer if you have
                  questions about amending your medical record.</p>
                <p>You have the right to receive an accounting of certain disclosures
                  we have made, if any, of your medical information. This right applies
                  to disclosures for purposes other than treatment, payment or health
                  care operations as described in this Notice of Privacy Practices.
                  It excludes disclosures we may have made pursuant to your authorization
                  (permission), made directly to you, to family members or friends
                  involved in your care, or for appointment notification purposes.
                  You have the right to receive specific information regarding these
                  disclosures that occurred after April 14, 2003. You may request
                  a shorter timeframe. The right to receive this information is subject
                  to certain exceptions, restrictions and limitations.</p>

                  us. If you would like a paper copy of this notice, please request
