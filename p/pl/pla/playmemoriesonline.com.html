this information we may gather directly by asking (e.g., hobbies, interests,
purchasing habits, music preferences, difficulties in using a particular
feature),but we also aggregate information in a non-personally identifiable
manner using our technology, such as visitors' and users' browsing or use
activities, the domain or mobile phone area code or device number and carrier
from which a visitor accesses or clicks through to a website, page views,
downloads, streaming and the like. We use such information to enhance and
customize our websites and services and the advertising and promotions we make
available to attempt to create a better experience. We aggregate information
(meaning it does not identify any individual) to analyze trends and statistics
to improve your online experiences, our websites, services, and customer
support. If you visit or use the websites or have registered or provided us
with Personal Information about yourself, it is likely that "cookies"
(how we use "cookies" is described in the section below entitled
"Cookies") allow us to identify you and associate you with your

thereon, use one or more of the SEL website services, or receive emails from
SEL, we may use technology commonly referred to as a "cookie" which
stores small bits of data on your computer. While actual "cookie"
technology is currently among the most common, we may use a wide variety of
technological tools, means and mechanisms (e.g., XML technology, clickstream
data, etc.) to help us to customize your experience to better match your
interests and preferences and otherwise improve and enhance the services we
provide. We will use the term "cookie" to refer to any and or all of
these tools, means and mechanisms, whether they are currently available and in
use, developed or discovered in the future or otherwise. We use cookies in a
variety of ways. For example, we use cookies to save your user ID, Account
number or other information (so you do not have to re-enter it each time you
visit or use our services) and to help us keep count of your return visits to
our websites and, in some cases, to our advertisers' or partners' or co-branded
websites, which helps us determine which services, promotions, features,
content and functions users like best. In general, browsers or separately
purchased software tools may allow you to erase cookies from your hard drive.
You acknowledge and understand that erasing cookies may limit or restrict your
ability to use any or all the features and functions of our websites and
services. In particular and without limiting the foregoing, if you block your
cookies, you will not be able to use the eBook Service (described in the
Supplement to this Privacy Policy, below). We may also use technology to detect
the absence or presence of any versions of software or software updates
installed on your computer and to track and monitor content you are
downloading, streaming, using or otherwise accessing. Any or all of these
activities can occur periodically or when necessary, without any other specific
notice to you. We may also use cookies to identify your computer each time we
automatically update or attempt to update your software. Cookies allow us to
transmit and arrange for automatic installation of updates, modifications and
even full re-installations of software on your computer to address security,
digital rights management, interoperability or performance issues or to enhance
the range of features and functions available through our websites. Any or all
of these activities can occur periodically or when necessary, without any other
specific notice to you.</span></p>

you to consent to any collection, disclosure or use of Personal Information
beyond what we require to fulfill the purposes we identify to you. Of course,
subject to any legal restrictions or requirements, you may withdraw your
consent at any time as described in our Privacy Policy.</span></p>
