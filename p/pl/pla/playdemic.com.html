<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Playdemic develops and publishes social games for the web and
mobile devices including Gourmet Ranch and Crossword Buddies (the
"Service"). In this policy, "Playdemic" refers to Playdemic Limited
and its Affiliates, which shall mean subsidiaries, parent
companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common
ownership. We may also refer to Playdemic as "We" or "Us". This
Privacy Policy describes:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<ul>
<li>the information We collect, how We do so and the purposes of
our collection</li>

<li>how We use and with whom We share such information</li>

<li>how you can access and update such information</li>

<li>the choices you can make about how We collect, use and share
your information</li>

<li>how We protect the information We store about you<br>
 &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>If you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy or our
collection and use of information, please contact us as described
in Section 14 ("Contact Us").</p>

<p>If you access our games from a third party Social Networking
Site ("SNS"), you may be required to also read and accept the SNS
Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Information We Collect</strong></p>

<p><strong>Information about You Received from an SNS</strong></p>

<p>When you use any Playdemic game at an SNS such as Facebook or
Google +, where our games may also be referred to as
"applications", you allow Playdemic to access certain information
from your profile for that site. The information you allow
Playdemic to access varies by game and SNS, and it is affected by
the privacy settings you establish at the SNS. You can control and
find out more about these settings at the SNS where you play our
games. For example, Playdemic may access and store some or all of
the following information, as allowed by you, the SNS and your
preferences:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<ul>
<li>your first and last name</li>

<li>your profile picture or its URL</li>

<li>your user ID number, which is linked to publicly available
information such as name and profile photo</li>

<li>the user ID numbers for your friends that are also connected to
our game(s)</li>

<li>the login e-mail you provided to that SNS when you
registered</li>

<li>your physical location and that of your access devices</li>

<li>your gender</li>

<li>your birthday<br>
 &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>By playing a Playdemic game through an SNS, you are authorizing
Playdemic to collect, store, and use in accordance with this
Privacy Policy any and all information that you agreed the SNS
could provide to Playdemic through the SNS Application Programming
Interface ("API"). Your agreement takes place when you "accept" or
"allow" (or similar terms) one of our applications on an SNS.<br>
 &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Information We Collect from You Directly</strong></p>

<p>When you interact with the Service (whether or not on an SNS),
at www.Playdemic.com, or any Playdemic-owned website, We may
collect and store information from you directly as described
below:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Registration Information</strong></p>

<p>We may allow you to "register" with Us by using Facebook Connect
or other SNS authentication options to create an account or profile
within the Service. We may also provide a more typical registration
flow where you may be required to provide the following
information: your age or birthday (for age screening and/or to
better understand who our users are); your first and last names;
your e-mail address; a password and other information that helps Us
confirm that it is you accessing your account.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may also offer you the option to complete a user profile that
is visible to other Playdemic users. Your user profile may include:
a profile photo; one or more game username(s); your gender;
biographic details that you provide; links to your profiles on
various SNS; details about the games you play; and a Playdemic user
ID number that is created by Playdemic and used to identify your
profile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Playdemic user ID number used to identify your account and
profile will be public and will appear in the URL of your profile
page, but will only permit access to information that is considered
public or that you have designated as public in your settings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your first and last names and profile picture are considered
"public" on Playdemic websites that offer direct access to
Playdemic games and search engines may index this publicly
available information. When We offer profiles, We will also offer
functionality that allows you to opt-out of public indexing of your
public profile information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may also offer you the ability to import your address book
contacts or manually enter e-mail addresses so that you can (i)
locate your contacts on Playdemic; and (ii) invite those contacts
to join you in our games. We will store those contacts for purposes
of helping you and your contacts make connections on our site. If
you do not want your contacts stored just follow the instructions
available at the "Learn More" link. Passwords provided to Playdemic
for the purpose of accessing your address book will not be
stored.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Information We Receive or Collect When You Access
Playdemic Games on a Mobile Device.</strong></p>

<p>If you play Playdemic games on your mobile telephone or other
mobile device, including iPads and tablets, We collect your mobile
device identifier and IP Address. In certain games We will create
and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an
account number. We may collect the name you have associated with
your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other
information you choose to provide, such as user name, character
name, geo-location or e-mail address. We may also access your
contacts to enable you to invite friends to join you in the
Service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Payment Information</strong></p>

<p>If you purchase a license to use in-game virtual currency or
virtual items directly from Playdemic, We will collect the billing
and financial information necessary to process your charges, which
may include your postal and e-mail addresses. Playdemic may also
receive the billing and payment information that you provide when
your purchase is processed by another party, such as Facebook (for
Facebook Credits) or Apple (for purchases on iOS devices). Our <a href="/terms-of-service.aspx" title="Terms of Service">Terms of
Service</a> explain our policies and terms relevant to our charges
and billing practices. Please note that purchases of third party
credits or currencies like Facebook Credits may also be subject to
additional policies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Customer Support Correspondence</strong></p>

<p>When you ask for assistance from our <a href="http://support.playdemic.com/support/" target="_blank">Customer Support</a> team, We will collect and
store the contact information you provide (generally your name and
e-mail address), information about your game play or activity on
the Service, and your user ID number. We will also store the
correspondence and any information contained within.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SMS Notifications, Push Notifications &amp; Local
Notifications</strong></p>

<p>We receive and store the information you provide, including your
telephone number, when you sign up to have SMS notifications sent
directly to your mobile phone. These messages notify you of in-game
activity and may allow you to play the game from your phone. You
can adjust the types of notifications you receive and when you
receive them by editing your SMS notification settings; just log in
to your game account and choose SMS mobile from the Help menu.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With your consent We may send push notifications to your mobile
device to provide game updates and other relevant messages. You can
manage push notifications from the "options" or "settings" page
within the relevant game. You may also be able to manage them from
your device's settings page for the relevant game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may send local notifications to your mobile device to provide
game updates and other relevant information. You can manage local
notifications from the "options" or "settings" page within the
relevant game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Technical and Usage Information</strong></p>

<p>When you access our websites or play our games, We collect (i)
certain technical information about your mobile device or computer
system, including IP Address and mobile device ID; and (ii) usage
statistics about your interactions with the Service. This
information is typically collected through the use of server log
files or web log files ("Log Files"), mobile device software
development kits and tracking technologies like browser cookies to
collect and analyze certain types of technical information. Some of
the cookies the Service places on your computer are linked to your
user ID number(s). For more information on how We utilize cookies
and other tracking technologies please review the "Cookies and
Automated Information Collection" portion of Section 3 ("How We
Collect Information about You").</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. How We Collect Information about You</strong></p>

<p>We may collect information about you in any one or more of the
following ways:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Information about Players and Play</strong></p>

<p>When you play one of our games, Playdemic collects and stores
certain information that you provide directly or through the SNS or
other third party website that is offering our game(s). To provide
a richer game play and social experience, We also collect
information about your play and interaction with other players and
the Service. The bulk of this information is collected and stored
through the use of Log Files, which are files on our web servers
that record actions taken on our games and websites.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Communications Features</strong></p>

<p>You may be able to take part in certain activities on our
websites or games that give you the opportunity to communicate or
share information not just with Playdemic, but also with other
users of our Service. These include:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<ul>
<li>participating in player forums and message boards</li>

<li>posting public comments to other users' profiles or
gameboards</li>

<li>sending private messages or invitations to other users, either
directly on our websites or to their e-mail accounts</li>

<li>chat with other users</li>

<li>posting photos<br>
 &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>We may record and store archives of these communications on
Playdemic's servers to protect the safety and well being of our
users and Playdemic's rights and property in connection with the
service. You acknowledge and consent to the recording and storage
of such communications for these purposes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cookies and Automated Information
Collection</strong></p>

<p>When you access the Service, We collect certain technical
information in order to (i) analyze the usage of our sites and
services; (ii) provide a more personalized experience; and (iii)
manage advertising. We and service providers acting on our behalf,
such as Google Analytics, use Log Files and tracking technologies
to collect and analyze certain types of technical information,
including cookies, IP addresses, device type, device identifiers,
browser types, browser language, referring and exit pages, and
URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing
pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of
time spent on particular pages, game state and the date and time of
activity on our websites or games, and other similar information.
In some cases, We will associate this information with your user ID
number for our internal use.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons,
which allow Us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an
e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow Us to
advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from
certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new
installation or delivering ads to you on other websites; and (iii)
local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help Us to
prevent fraud, remember your in-game preferences and speed up load
times.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place
cookies on your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow.
Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie
management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash
cookies. To learn more about and manage flash cookies you can visit
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/articles/lso/" target="_blank">adobe.com</a> and make changes at the privacy
settings panel. If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the
features and functionality of playing our games, as Playdemic
cookies are necessary to track and enhance your game activities.
Please note that companies delivering advertisements in our games
or on our websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and
those practices are subject to their own policies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Other Sources</strong></p>

<p>We may collect or receive information from other sources
including (i) other Playdemic users who choose to upload their
email contacts; and (ii) third party information providers. This
information will be used to supplement your profile - primarily to
help you and your friends connect. It will be combined with other
information We collect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. How We Use the Information We Collect</strong></p>

<p>In general, We collect, store and use your information to
provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized
experience. For example, We may use information collected from you
in any one or more of the following ways:<br>
 &nbsp;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<ul>
<li>to create your game accounts and allow play of our games</li>

<li>to identify and suggest connections with other Playdemic
users</li>

<li>to enable user-to-user communications</li>

<li>to provide technical support and respond to user inquiries</li>

<li>to prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and enforce
our Terms of Service</li>

<li>to deliver and target advertising</li>

<li>to notify users of in-game updates</li>

<li>to provide in-game leader boards and promote in-game player
achievements</li>

<li>to solicit input and feedback to improve Playdemic products and
services and customize your user experience</li>

<li>to inform users about new products or promotional offers</li>

<li>to engage in commonly accepted practices, such as contacting
you at the email address We have on file if you are a potential
winner in a sweepstakes<br>
 &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>One important use of your information is communication. If you
have provided your e-mail address to Playdemic, We'll use it to
respond to (i) customer support inquiries, and (ii) keep you
informed of your in-game activity, including comments from friends,
notifications about in-game status such as "crops ready" as well as
notifications of gift and neighbor requests. Some messages, such as
invites for friends to join you in a game, may include your name
and profile photo. We may also send promotional e-mail messages and
promotional SMS messages ("Promotional Communications") directly or
in partnership with parties other than Playdemic. Each Promotional
Communication will generally offer recipients choices about
receiving additional messages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Sharing of Your Information</strong></p>

<p>We will share your information (in some cases personal
information) with third parties, that is parties other than
Playdemic, in the following circumstances:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Service Providers</strong></p>

<p>We will provide your information to third party companies to
perform services on our behalf, including payment processing, data
analysis, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service and
to assist Us in our marketing efforts. We direct all such third
party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the
information disclosed to them and to not use your information for
any purpose other than to provide services on Playdemic's
behalf.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Friends and Other Playdemic Players</strong></p>

<p>The Service supports and may encourage interaction among
players. In most Playdemic games your SNS friends will see your
name, profile photo and descriptions of your game activity. In many
Playdemic games friends and other players will be able to see your
game profile, which may include your name or a "game name" and your
profile photo, which in certain cases can reveal your SNS User ID
number or Playdemic ID. Access to a Playdemic ID or your SNS User
ID may allow others to view the public information associated with
your related SNS or Playdemic account. Other players may also be
able to send you game requests or even friend requests through the
related SNS' communication channels.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Advertising of Third Party Products and
Services</strong></p>

<p>We do not actively share personal information with third party
advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give Us
your consent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may share (i) aggregated information (information about you
and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to
you); (ii) anonymous information; and (iii) certain technical
information (including IP Addresses and mobile device IDs) to
develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Service and on the
websites of third parties. We may also allow advertisers to collect
these types of information within the Service and they may share it
with Us. Advertisers may collect this information through the use
of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons. The
information collected may be used to offer you targeted
ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your user
experience by ensuring that advertisements for products and
services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral
advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze
traffic and other end user activity to improve your
experience).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our collection, use, and disclosure of anonymous or aggregated
information are not subject to any of the restrictions in this
Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Offer Walls</strong></p>

<p>Playdemic games or their purchase pages may display an "offer
wall" that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall
allows third party advertisers to provide virtual currency to users
in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing
a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with
one of those advertisers. These are not offers made by Playdemic.
These offers may be displayed to you based on certain technical
information, such as your geographic area or anonymous demographic
information. After clicking on one of these advertisements, you
will no longer be on a site hosted by Playdemic or a partnering
SNS. To properly credit user accounts and to prevent fraud, a
unique identifier, in some cases your user ID number, will be
shared with the offer wall provider.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Safety, Security and Compliance with Law</strong></p>

<p>Your information, and the contents of all of your online
communications (including without limitation chat text, voice
communications, IP addresses and your personal information) may be
accessed and monitored as necessary to provide the Service and may
be disclosed: (i) when We have a good faith belief that We are
required to disclose the information in response to legal process
(for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); (ii) to
satisfy any applicable laws or regulations (iii) where We believe
that the Service is being used in the commission of a crime,
including to report such criminal activity or to exchange
information with other companies and organizations for the purposes
of fraud protection and credit risk reduction; (iv) when We have a
good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to
the health and/or safety of you, another person or the public
generally; and (v) in order to protect the rights or property of
Playdemic, including to enforce our <a href="/terms-of-service.aspx" title="Terms of Service">Terms of
Service</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sale or Merger</strong></p>

<p>In the event that Playdemic undergoes a business transition,
such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or
a portion of its assets, We may transfer all of your information,
including personal information, to the successor organization in
such transition.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>6. Our Policies Concerning Children</strong></p>

<p>Our websites and games are not intended for children under the
age of 13 and We do not knowingly collect any personal information
from such children. Children under the age of 13 should not use our
websites or games at any time. In the event that We learn that We
have inadvertently gathered personal information from children
under the age of 13, We will take reasonable measures to promptly
erase such information from our records.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>7. How to Access and Update Your
Information</strong></p>

<p><strong>Information We Receive From an SNS Where You Play Our
Games</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To manage the information Playdemic receives about you from an
SNS where you play our games, you will need to follow the
instructions at that site for updating your information and
changing your privacy settings. The privacy management tools for
applications on Facebook can be found <a href="http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy" target="_blank">here</a>. The privacy management tools for Google +
can be found <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/settings/privacy?hl=en&amp;tab=4" target="_blank">here</a>. You can manage certain aspects of
information collection and use by going to the settings of your
(mobile) device and reviewing the permissions of each
application.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once Playdemic receives your information from an SNS, that
information is stored and used by Playdemic in accordance with this
Privacy Policy, and you may access and update that information as
described below. Game or other accounts created with Playdemic are
considered active until We receive a user request to delete them or
deactivate them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Other Methods of Accessing and Controlling your
Information</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<ul>
<li>If you no longer want Playdemic to make active use of your
information, you may send an e-mail to privacy@playdemic.com. Place
"Delete My Account" in the subject line and include your first
name, last name, e-mail address and user ID number for the SNS from
which you access our games (if applicable) in the body of the
e-mail. We will respond to your request within thirty (30) days.
Please note that certain records, for example those pertaining to
payments or customer service matters, will be retained for legal
and accounting purposes. If you have sent or posted content on the
Service, We may not be able to delete it.</li>

<li>If you wish to review or change the information Playdemic has
about you, e-mail Us at the address provided herein.</li>

<li>You can turn off push notifications by visiting the "options"
or "settings" page within the relevant game. You can turn off local
notifications by visiting the "options" or "settings" page within
the relevant game.</li>

<li>You can stop further use of your geo-location (for example
through "check-ins") by visiting your device's settings for the
relevant application or the "settings" page for the relevant game.
You can also stop checking in.</li>

<li>If you have additional questions about this Privacy Policy,
contact Us at <a href="mailto:privacy@playdemic.com">privacy@playdemic.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>8. Your Sharing and Messaging Options</strong></p>

<p><strong><br>
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Information We Receive from Third Party SNS Where You
play a Playdemic Game</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you play our games at a third-party SNS, Playdemic will be
able to access and store profile and other information about you as
described above. The categories of information you share with Us
will depend, in part, on the permissions you grant Us and the
privacy settings you have established at the SNS where you access
the application. Playdemic does not offer an "opt out" option for
specific fields that are shared by the SNS where you access and
play the game(s).</p>

<p><strong>Opting out of Promotional Communications</strong></p>

<p>You can choose to opt out of receiving additional promotional
e-mails from Playdemic by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link in any
such e-mail. Please note that once We receive your request, it may
take an additional period of time for your opt-out to become
effective. Your unsubscribe or e-mail preference change will be
processed promptly, and in no event longer than 10 business
days.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Opting Out of Other Communications</strong></p>

<p>You can opt out of receiving SMS messages by texting STOP to the
number We send from for that particular SMS program. In some cases
a preference management page will also be available under the
"Help" menu of the game that is offering the SMS program. When We
receive an opt-out message from you for SMS messages, We may send a
message confirming our receipt of your opt-out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you install our apps on your mobile device you can choose
to receive push notifications. You can turn off push notifications
by visiting the "options" or "settings" page within the relevant
game. You may also receive local notifications. You can turn off
local notifications by visiting the "options" or "settings" page
within the relevant game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note that if you opt-out of our Promotional Communications or
other forms of communication, We may still e-mail or communicate
with you from time to time if We need to provide you with
information or if We need to request information from you with
respect to a transaction initiated by you or for other legitimate
non-marketing reasons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9. International Operations</strong></p>

<p>As part of our international operations, We may transfer data to
our Affiliates from time to time for our legitimate business
purposes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playdemic will store information about site visitors and players
on servers located in different countries from time to time.
Personal data collected within any country may be transferred to,
and stored at, a destination in any other country in the world. The
data We hold may also be processed by employees operating in any
country by Us or one of our Affiliates or for one of our vendors.
Such employees may be engaged in, among other things, (i) the
processing of transactions and your payment details and (ii) the
provision of support services. By submitting your personal data or
playing Playdemic games, you agree to this transfer, storing or
processing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playdemic will take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is
treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>10. Privacy Policies of Linked Sites and
Advertisers</strong></p>

<p>Our websites and games may contain advertisements from companies
other than Playdemic that may link to their own websites. We are
not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such
websites. If you have any questions about how these other websites
use your information, you should review their policies and contact
them directly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>11. Security of Your Information</strong></p>

<p>Playdemic implements reasonable security measures to protect the
security of your information both online and offline, and We are
committed to the protection of customer information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For user accounts registered directly with Playdemic profile
information is protected by the password each member uses to access
their online account. It is important that you protect and maintain
the security of your account and that you immediately notify Us of
any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to
your Playdemic account, the website allows you to request that
instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your
password. When you sign into your account or enter payment
information (such as a credit card number when purchasing virtual
currency), We encrypt the transmission of that information using
secure socket layer technology ("SSL").</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While We take reasonable precautions against possible security
breaches of our websites and our customer databases and records, no
website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and We
cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or
other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep
your personal information safe (including your account password),
and to log out of your account after use. If your SNS account is
hacked, this may lead to unauthorised play of your Playdemic games,
so be careful to keep your account information secure. If you have
questions about the security of our websites, please contact Us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@playdemic.com">privacy@playdemic.com</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet
is not completely secure. Although We strive to protect your
personal data, We cannot guarantee the security of your data while
it is being transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your
own risk. Once We have received your information, We have
procedures and security features in place to try to prevent
unauthorized access.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>12. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>If We decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, We
will notify you and other users by placing a notice on
Playdemic.com or by sending you a notice to the e-mail address We
have on file for you. We may supplement this process by placing
notices in our games and on other Playdemic websites. You should
periodically check www.playdemic.com and this privacy page for
updates.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>13. Sharing of information with Third
Parties</strong></p>

<p>We do not share personal information with third parties for
their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to
such disclosure, typically by "opting in" to receive information
from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other
promotion on one of our sites. If you do ask Us to share your
personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes,
We will only share information in connection with that specific
promotion, as We do not share information with any third party
(other than our service providers) on a continual basis. To prevent
disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing
by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide
personal information on one of our sites.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Right to Access</strong></p>

<p>Users in certain jurisdictions have a right to access personal
information held about themselves. Your right of access can be
exercised in accordance with applicable law. Please submit any
requests for access to your personal data in writing to <a href="mailto:privacy@playdemic.com">privacy@playdemic.com</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
