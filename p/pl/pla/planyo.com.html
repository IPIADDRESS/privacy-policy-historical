1. Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online
information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally
identifiable information may be requested.

2. The Information We Collect:

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Planyo website. The types of personal
information collected are:

      Name
      Address
      Email address
      Phone and/or fax number

3. The Way We Use Information:

We use the information you provide about yourself when making a reservation only to complete the reservation
details. We do not share this information with outside parties except the owner / administrator of
the resource you are reserving.

We use the email addresses to answer the email we receive and to send you information related to your
reservations such as notification about reservation and updated reservation status. Such addresses are not
used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties except the owner / administrator of the
resource you are reserving.

You can register with our website if you would like to be able to manage your reservations and to have your
personal information automatically filled out during future reservations.

We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design and promote our website but we would
not disclose anything that could be used to identify any individual.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways
unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise
prohibit such unrelated uses.

4. Our Commitment To Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have 
put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
information we collect online.

5. Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never
collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and
no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

6. How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain
by logging into your account and going to the user settings page. We use this procedure to better
safeguard your information.

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us
a request that credibly shows error.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity
before granting access or making corrections.

7. How To Contact Us
