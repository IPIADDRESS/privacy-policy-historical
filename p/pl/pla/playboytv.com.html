&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We collect IP addresses and anonymous demographic information (such as your zip code) and may use this data to: tailor your experience at our Sites; provide content in which we think you may be interested; display content according to your preferences; and analyze traffic to our Sites.<br>
<br>
<u><strong>What do we do with the information we collect?</strong></u><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We use personal information and other demographic or profile information you provide to us to fulfill your order or request; to provide you with information about Playboy, some of our partners and third party companies in which we think you may be interested; and to contact you when necessary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We use IP addresses and anonymous demographic information to tailor your experiences at our Sites by showing content in which we think you will be interested and displaying content according to your preferences. Anonymous demographic information is shared with advertisers and market researchers on an aggregate basis.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We use information collected to evaluate and improve our services. We may develop and use, in our sole discretion, consumer research which may be based on your use of our services.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal information collected on the Sites is stored and processed in the United States and by using any of the Sites, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.<br>
<br>
<u><strong>Do we share the information we collect with third parties?</strong></u><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some cases, we will share information we collect (including personal information or anonymous demographic information) with third party companies who may offer products or services in which we believe you may be interested. We also share this information with third parties with whom we partner to co-promote and administer sweepstakes and contests on our Sites.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also share information we collect with third party service providers to manage certain aspects of the services we provide, such as maintaining our servers and processing or fulfilling orders for products and services you purchase through the Sites.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also disclose your information in special cases if required to do so by law, court order or other governmental authority or when we believe in good faith that disclosing this information is otherwise necessary or advisable, including, for instance, to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with the rights or property of Playboy, another user or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.<br>
<br>
<u><strong>Is the information submitted in public forums confidential?</strong></u><br>
