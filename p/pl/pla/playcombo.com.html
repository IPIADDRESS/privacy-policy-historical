                <p>Privacy Policy Playcombo Games ("Playcombo") is committed to ensuring our websites (www.playcombo.com;
                    www.playcombo.*;www.*.playcombo.*) and any published apps (under the publisher name: Playcombo or
                    Playcombo Games) are fun and safe environments. Playcombo does not actively run a user registration
                    system, forum, chat or instant messaging function and thereby does not directly collect any
                    personally identifiable information about our users unless they directly contact us or respond to a
                    feedback survey and provide such information.</p>

                <p>Some games featured or hosted on Playcombo that are managed by third-party publishers may contain
                    features such as user registration systems, forums, chat rooms and so forth; which are not managed
                    by Playcombo and are dictated by the privacy policy of the game's publisher.</p>

                <p>Playcombo does however collect some basic browsing related data for advertising and analytics
                    purposes. Please consult the below privacy policy which contains further details:</p>

                <p class="text-success"><strong>Cookies and data collected:</strong></p>

                <p>Playcombo collects information about the way visitors and players are using our website through the
                    use of Google Analytics and its related cookie(s). The goal of collecting this data is to make
                    better informed decisions about what games our users are more likely to enjoy and to help improve
                    the experience on Playcombo. The type of information that Google Analytics collects includes browser
                    and operating system type, country, pages visited, time spent on site, date/time stamp and broad
                    demographic information. Google Analytics does not collect any personally identifiable information
                    about you on Playcombo.</p>

                <p>Certain games on Playcombo will create "Local shared objects" which allow the game to save game
                    progress so that when you return you can pick up from where you left off. Any game save data is
                    stored only on your computer and not transferred to Playcombo or any other third party. Some games
                    from third-party publishers that are included on Playcombo may offer the ability to save
                    game-progress in the cloud via third-party servers, in which the storage and retrieval of such data
                    is dictated by the privacy policy of such game publisher offering the service.</p>

                <p class="text-success"><strong>External Links:</strong></p>

                <p>Playcombo may link to other web sites and is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of
                    these external sites. Some games on Playcombo also contain links to external sites or may contain
                    requests for personal information for gameplay purposes (e.g. account registration or chatroom
                    features) which are governed by their own individual privacy policies. All users should therefore
                    also be aware of the individual privacy policies within any game that requests personal information
                    such as name or email address. </p>

                <p class="text-success"><strong>Advertising:</strong></p>

                <p>Playcombo is a free to use website and generates revenue through third-party advertising on the
                    website. Without the support of this advertising Playcombo would not be able to provide new games.
                    These third-party advertising companies may collect and use information about your visits to this
                    and other websites to help determine which advertisements are most suited to your interests and
                    measure performance of any advertising campaigns. In order to collect this information, the
                    third-party may use a cookie or other such as javascript codes. Playcombo has no influence over the
                    policies of third-party advertising networks (except our ability to discontinue using their
                    services).

                </p><p>If you would like more information about advertising practices and to know your choices about not
                    having this information used by these companies, you can visit Google's Advertising and Privacy

                <p>We are committed to complying with the children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Playcombo
                    has no user forums or instant message capabilities, and thus no private information pertaining to
                    children can be shared on Playcombo. However certain games hosted on Playcombo may have such
                    features as described in the External Links section, and are governed by their own individual
                    privacy policy. If you have any concern that information related to the privacy of children has been
                    submitted to Playcombo, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@playcombo.com" class="btn btn-success btn-sm">contact@playcombo.com</a>

                    comments, thoughts, business
