<i>Platinum Server Management, Inc.</i> is dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal information obtained from you with care and respect.  This Privacy Policy is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies and principles.
<br><br>

In order to use this Web site, you must first complete the registration form.  During registration you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on our site.<br><br>

<i>Platinum Server Management, Inc.</i> is the sole owner of the information collected on www.platinumservermanagement.com. <i>Platinum Server Management, Inc.</i> collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.<br><br>

If you purchase a service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to verify and process your orders. We may call you to verify the order for security purposes and/or request additional security/verification information to verify and validate your order. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.<br><br>

We provide you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information.  For example, if you purchase a service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.<br><br>

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by emailing us at sales@platinumservermanagement.com

<br><br>
If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.  Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe.
<br><br>

Cookies:<br><br>

A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device when you visit, typically containing information about the website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web browser when you return, additional data that serves the purpose of the cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.
<br><br>
We use cookies to help improve your experience of https://www.platinumservermanagement.com . This cookie policy is part of Platinum Server Management, Inc.'s privacy policy, and covers the use of cookies between your device and our site.
<br><br>
If you don't wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct your browser to refuse cookies from https://www.platinumservermanagement.com . Most browsers are configured to accept cookies by default, but you can update these settings to either refuse cookies altogether, or to notify you when a website is trying to set or update a cookie. If you browse websites from multiple devices, you may need to update your settings on each individual device.
<br><br>

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.
<br><br>
 We set a persistent cookie to remember the affiliate you found our site through. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site.
 
<br><br>
Log Files:<br><br>

As is true of most Web sites, the web server gathers certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes information such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), country, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, device info, geolocation data, device type, operating system, unique device identifiers, device settings, etc. What we collect can depend on the individual settings of your device and software. We recommend checking the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider to learn what information they make available to us.

<br><br>
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our visitors and user base as a whole.
<br><br>

Personal information
<br><br>
To sign up with our service, we ask for personal information, such as your:
<br><br>
Name, Email, Phone, Address, and Payment information.
<br><br>
  This data is considered "identifying information", as it can personally identify you. We only request personal information relevant to providing you with a service, and only use it to help provide or improve this service. You can update and/or remove this information at any time through our Client Login. Credit card information collected is submitted to our third party merchant payment processor solely for payment purposes.
<br><br>
Server information
<br><br>
To provide our service, we ask for your server information. This data is used to provide server management, monitoring, technical support, and related services. You can update and/or remove this information at any time through our Client Login.
<br><br>
If your personally identifiable information or server information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change inside our Client Login information page or by emailing sales@platinumservermanagement.com
<br><br>
The security of your personal information and server information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or server login information) on our forms it is transmitted through secure socket layer technology (SSL).
<br><br>
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
<br><br>
How we collect information
<br><br>
We collect information by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we're collecting it and how it will be used. You are free to refuse our request for this information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services without it. If you are unclear, unsure, or do not fully understand how information is collected and/or used, please email us to sales@platinumservermanagement.com
<br><br>
If you have any questions about privacy, security, policies, procedures, or anything at all regarding our service, company, or website, you can send email us at sales@platinumservermanagement.com
