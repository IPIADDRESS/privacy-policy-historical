  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  
  
<p></p><p>We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and
this policy (together with our <a href="/terms.html">terms of
use</a> and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the
basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you
provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following
carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your
personal data and how we will treat it.</p>
<p>For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act), PMU
Publishing Limited, Granite Buildings, 6 Stanley Street, Liverpool
L1 6AF is the data controller.</p>
<h2>Information We May Collect From You</h2>
<p>We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>
<p>Information that you provide by filling in forms on our site.
This includes information provided at the time of registering to
use our site, subscribing to our service, posting material or
requesting further services. We may also ask you for information
when you enter a competition, request details relating to a
promotion or when you report a problem with our site.</p>
<p>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that
correspondence.</p>
<p>We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research
purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.</p>
<p>Details of your visits to our site including, but not limited
to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication
data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or
otherwise and the resources that you access.</p>
<h2>IP Addresses, Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
<p>We may collect information about your computer, including where
available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for
system administration and to report aggregate information to our
advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing
actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>
<p>For the same reason, we may obtain information about your
general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on
the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that
is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to
improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised
service. They enable us:</p>
<p>To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.</p>
<p>To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to
customise our site according to your individual interests.</p>
<p>To speed up your searches.</p>
<p>To recognise you when you return to our site.</p>
<p>You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on
your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies.
However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access
certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser
setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue
cookies when you log on to our site.</p>
<p>Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over
which we have no control.</p>
<p>Our website may contain electronic images known as web beacons
which allows us to count users who have visited those pages and
deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access
your personally identifiable information on our site. They are a
technique to compile aggregated statistics about our website's
usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information
including a cookie number, time and date of a page view and a
description of the page on which the web beacon resides.</p>
<h2>Where We Store Your Personal Data</h2>
<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and
stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area
("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating
outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such
staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the processing of your
payment details and the provision of support services. By
submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing
or processing. These agents have access to the personal information
required in order to perform their functions but may not use it for
any other purpose and we will take all steps reasonably necessary
to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with
this privacy policy.</p>
<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure
servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted. Where we have
given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you
to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for
keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a
password with anyone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet
is not completely secure. Athough we will do our best to protect
your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data
transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once
we have received your information, we will use strict procedures
and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
<h2>Uses Made Of The Information</h2>
<p>We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>
<p>To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most
effective manner for you and for your computer.</p>
<p>To provide you with information, products or services that you
request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have
consented to be contacted for such purposes.</p>
<p>To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered
into between you and us.</p>
<p>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our
service, when you choose to do so.</p>
<p>To notify you about changes to our service.</p>
<p>We may also use your data, or permit selected third parties to
use your data, to provide you with information about goods and
services which may be of interest to you and we or they may contact
you about these by post or telephone.</p>
<p>If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by
electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and
services similar to those which you have previously expressed an
interest in.</p>
<p>If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third
parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by
electronic means only if you have consented to this.</p>
<p>If you do not want us to use your data in this way, or to pass
your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, please
tick the relevant box situated on the form on which we collect your
data (the registration form).</p>
<p>We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to
our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information
about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged
under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We
may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach
the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in
L1). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from
you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by
displaying their advertisement to that target audience.</p>
<h2>Registration and Newsletters</h2>
<p>Users of our website can register for a number of e-mail
newsletters, updates including, without limitation, our jobs and
property listings. This service is entirely optional and you may
unsubscribe at any time by contacting
paul.unger@placenorthwest.co.uk.</p>
<p>We advertise details of job opportunities with our members on
our website. If you apply for one of the positions we may ask you
to provide further information about yourself so that we, and/or
the relevant member, can contact you. These details together with
any details you provide in a CV or application form will be treated
as confidential and we will not allow employers to see any of your
details without your prior consent.</p>
<h2>Disclosure Of Your Information</h2>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
<p>In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in
which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective
seller or buyer of such business or assets.</p>
<p>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data
in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to
enforce or apply our <a href="/terms.html">terms of use</a> and
other agreements; or to protect our rights or property and the
safety of our customers or others. This includes exchanging
information with other companies and organisations for the purposes
of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data
for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before
collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such
purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third
party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent
such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to
collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by
contacting us at paul.unger@placenorthwest.co.uk.</p>
<p>Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the
websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If
you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these
websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept
any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check
these policies before you submit any personal data to these
websites.</p>
<h2>Access To Information</h2>
<p>The Act gives you the right to access information held about
you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the
Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet
our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold
about you.</p>
<h2>Changes To Our Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will
be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by
e-mail.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>Questions, comments and requests regarding this privacy policy
are welcomed and should be addressed to
