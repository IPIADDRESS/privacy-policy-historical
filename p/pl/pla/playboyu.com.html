		<p><b>PLAYBOY U PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
		<p>Effective as of August 1, 2007</p>
		<p>This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") applies to Playboy Enterprises, Inc.'s and Playboy.com, Inc.'s (collectively, "Playboy," "we" or "us") social networking website known as PlayboyU.com ("Playboy U"). It does NOT apply to other online or offline Playboy websites, products or services.</p>
		<p>This Policy explains what information we collect about you and what we do with it. We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, and we will notify you of any material changes to the Policy by posting the new Policy here and changing the "Effective Date" at the top. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes. By using or navigating any of Playboy U, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Policy or any modified Policy as posted. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use or visit any portion of Playboy U.</p>
		<br><br>
		<p><b>What information do we collect?</b></p>
		<p>We collect personal information submitted by users such as name, e-mail address and age in order to authenticate those users and to send administrative messages to them. Playboy U collects other personal information such as gender, school name, major and interests to facilitate communication between users. We generally collect this personal information when you sign up to create your profile on Playboy U. We may also collect information about you from time to time through our online surveys if you choose to participate.</p>
		<p>We collect and keep track of content and messages that you have uploaded on Playboy U.  We will also facilitate the storage of email addresses in our users' internal Playboy U address books.</p>
		<p>We collect IP addresses and anonymous demographic information (such as your zip code and browser type) and may use this data to: tailor your experience on Playboy U; provide content in which we think you may be interested; display content according to your preferences; and analyze traffic to Playboy U.</p>
		<p>Playboy U is built on a platform managed by a company called Ning.  By joining Playboy U, you are also registering for an account with Ning.  Ning may therefore collect certain information from you through Playboy U and your use of the Ning platform.  Ning's collection and use of such information is governed by Ning's privacy policy, which can be found here [Link to Ning Privacy Policy]. You should read Ning's privacy policy in order to understand exactly what information Ning collects and what they do with it. You can direct any concerns regarding their use of your information to their webmaster.</p>
		<p>Playboy makes every effort to not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18, or to knowingly allow such persons to register for Playboy U. No one under 18 is allowed to provide or post any personal information on Playboy U or to Playboy. In the event we learn such information has been collected, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. Please contact us at pbu@playboy.com to report instances of Playboy U users who are under 18 or any collection of information about such users.</p>
		<p><b>What do we do with the information we collect?</b></p>
		<p>We use personal information and other demographic or profile information you submit to us in order to provide you with a profile on Playboy U; to provide you with information about Playboy, Playboy U, and some of our partners and third party companies in which we think you may be interested; and to contact you when necessary.</p>
		<p>We use IP addresses and anonymous demographic information to tailor your experiences on Playboy U by showing content in which we think you will be interested and displaying content according to your preferences. Anonymous demographic information is shared with advertisers and market researchers on an aggregate basis.</p>
		<p>We use information collected to evaluate and improve our services. We may develop and use, in our sole discretion, consumer research which may be based on your use of Playboy U.</p>
		<p>Personal information collected on Playboy U is stored and processed in the United States, and by using any portion of Playboy U, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>
		<p><b>Do we share the information we collect with third parties?</b></p>
		<p>We will never sell your personal information to third parties.  In some cases, however, we will share information we collect (including personal information or anonymous demographic information) with third parties with whom we partner to co-promote and administer sweepstakes and contests on Playboy U.</p>
		<p>We may also share information we collect with third party service providers to manage certain aspects of the services we provide, such as maintaining our servers and the platform on which Playboy U is build.</p>
		<p>We may also disclose your information in special cases if required to do so by law, court order or other governmental authority or when we believe in good faith that disclosing this information is otherwise necessary or advisable, including, for instance, to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with the rights or property of Playboy, another Playboy U user or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p>
		<p>In the event of a change in ownership, or a merger with, acquisition by, or sale of assets to, another entity, we reserve the right to transfer all user information collected in connection with Playboy U, including email addresses, to a separate entity. Playboy will notify you (via a posting on Playboy U or the Privacy Policy or via email (in our discretion)) of such a transfer, and you may choose to modify your registration information at that time. This means that if you are concerned about your personal data migrating to a new owner, you can deactivate your account.</p>
		<p><b>Is the information posted on Playboy U confidential?</b></p>
		<p>No. You post content and information on Playboy U AT YOUR OWN RISK. Please remember that any information you disclose on Playboy U is shared with other users and becomes public information, meaning that other users and visitors of Playboy U will have access to any personal data you include in your content and messages.
