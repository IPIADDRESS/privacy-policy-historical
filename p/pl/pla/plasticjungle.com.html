      <h4>Our Commitment to Data Security</h4>
      <p>We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards intended to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.

      <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
      <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
      <p>
        If we learn of a security systems breach that affects the privacy of your personal information, then we will attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice through the Plastic Jungle Service if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at 
        <a href="mailto:customersuccess@plasticjungle.com">customersuccess@plasticjungle.com</a>.
