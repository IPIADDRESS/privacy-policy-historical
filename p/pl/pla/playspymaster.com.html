<p>iList, Inc. (“Company”), the makers of Spymaster, knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.  By visiting the <a href="http://playspymaster.com">Spymaster</a> website and domain name, or otherwise accessing or using any other linked pages, features, content, products, applications, or services offered from time to time by Company in connection therewith (collectively, the “Website”), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>


<h2><span class="caps">WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER</span>?</h2>


<p>This Privacy Policy covers Company’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that Company gathers when you access the Website and when you use any of Company’s services.  This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.</p>


<h2><span class="caps">WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT</span>?</h2>


<p>The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our users:</p>


<h3>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</h3>


<p>You can browse the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.  We may receive and store any information you enter on the Website or provide to us in any other way (e.g. through the registration process or that you upload or post to the Website).  The types of Personal Information collected may include your full name, gender, email address, mobile phone number, IP address, browser information, username, password, time zone and any other information necessary for us to provide our services. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.  The Personal Information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for Website related information, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about Website features and services.</p>


<p>In order for you to use our website, you must complete a registration form.  As part of this registration form, we require your first and last name, your email address and confirmation that you are 13 years or older.</p>


<p>If you choose to provide us with Personal Information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.</p>


<h3>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</h3>


<p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use our services.  Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.</p>


<p>Generally, the Website automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show.  Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.  This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services.  As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Website or services.  We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Company never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>


<h3>E-mail Communications:</h3>


<p>We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Company if your computer supports this type of program.  Company uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful.  We also may compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users.  When you receive e-mail from Company, you can opt out of receiving further e-mails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe.</p>


<h3>Information from Other Sources:</h3>


<p>For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.  We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.</p>


<h3>What About Cookies?</h3>


<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people.  We use cookies to enhance visitors’ experiences, to learn more about their use of the Website and to improve quality.</p>


<p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.  We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Website’s most attractive features.</p>


<p>Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
