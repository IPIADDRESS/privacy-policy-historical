      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p><em>Last Updated: June 29, 2010</em></p>
      
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Meta+Level Games, a division of IGN Entertainment, Inc. (“Meta+Level,” “We,” “Us,” or “Our”) protects your privacy when you access or use the website located at www.metalevelgames.com (the “Site”) or use our online service, which includes, among other things, software owned or controlled by Meta+Level that you have downloaded or are about to download, or have embedded or are about to embed, any applications owned or controlled by Meta+Level and available through social networking sites, and any software running on Meta+Level’s servers (“Meta+Level Software”), as well as any content, related documentation, and information made available by users to each other through the Meta+Level Software on our servers (collectively, the “Service”).</p>

      <p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED HEREIN.</p>

      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to information (including, personal information) collected through the Service. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us.  Personal information does not include “aggregate information”, which is data that we collect about the use of the Service, or about a group of products or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed.  This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information, and we may share aggregate data about our users with third parties for various purposes.</p>

      <p>From time-to-time, Meta+Level may revise this Privacy Policy and if we do, Meta+Level will post a notice that changes have been made on the Site and within the Service.  Your continued use of the Service after Meta+Level posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.  Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current privacy policies and practices.</p>

      <h3>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</h3>

      <h3>Active Collection of Information</h3>
      <p>Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you use the Service.  Meta+Level may collect personal information from you so that you can participate in activities like creating a personal profile (“Your Profile”), sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, in connection with content or suggestions you submit to us or when you contact us by email, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. We may also obtain personal information from reputable third parties or supplement personal information that we have collected directly from our users with additional personal information or non-personal information from reputable third parties.</p>

      <p>In order to use the Service, you must first register Your Profile with Meta+Level.  Your Profile information may include your name, birth date, gender, profile photo and email address.  You may complete the Member registration process by registering directly with the Site.  You may also register using a log-in credential from an approved social networking site through which Meta+Level may receive additional information about Your Profile, such as the identification of your friends within the applicable social network and your profile URLwithin such social network.  We may offer you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such as occupation, interests, zip code), or we may be able to collect that information from the social networking sites and systems on which you have embedded or used the Service, which would then also be covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <p>You may choose to voluntarily provide or store personal information (such as your first and last name), non-personal information and other content in Your Profile (such information is your “Profile Information”).  You may also choose to share information about yourself in other content (“Content”) you make available through the Service, such as in games.  The Profile Information you include in Your Profile and any Content you share with other players or users of the Service will automatically be made public and you provide it at your own discretion.</p>

      <p>Note that if you access or use the Service through a third party social networking site, such as Facebook, it is your responsibility to read and accept their terms of use and privacy policies prior to such use, including any updates to such terms and privacy policies.</p>

      <h3>Passive Collection of Information</h3>
      <p>In addition, when you access or use the Service, some non-personal information may be automatically collected. For example, it is standard for your web browser to automatically send information to every web site you visit including ours. Such information includes your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, access times, browser type and language, and referring web site addresses. We may also collect information about your computer’s operating system and information about your usage and activity on the Service.</p>

      <h4>Cookies</h4>
      <p>We may automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies.” Cookies are small data files that are stored on your hard drive by a web site. Among other things, the use of cookies helps us to improve the Service and your experience on the Service. Cookies may be used to see which areas and features of the Service are most popular, to count the number of computers accessing the Service, to personalize your experience and to remember your preferences. If your browser is set not to accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you may not be able to access certain features of the Service.</p>

      <h4>Web Beacons</h4>
      <p>Web beacons, also known as gifs, are electronic images that may be used with the Service or in our emails. A web beacon may be used on our web pages to collect information, deliver cookies, count visits, compile statistics on usage and campaign effectiveness and in our emails to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.</p>

      <p><strong>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION WITHIN THE SERVICE BY AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY COMPANY</strong></p>

      <p>Meta+Games may use an independent third party company to process financial transactions made available through or in connection with the Service. When an independent third party company selected by Meta+Games collects, transmits or processes your personal financial information, such as your credit card information or other payment information (collectively, “Personal Financial Information”), through the Service it is because you are submitting such Personal Financial Information in order to: (i) purchase any products from Meta+Games, such as in-game items or premium content; (ii) participate in a pay-to-play game; or (iii) purchase any additional services or products offered from time to time through the Service.</p>

      <p>You acknowledge and agree that this Privacy Policy will not apply to any Personal Financial Information that you provide to any independent third party company through the Service and that all Personal Financial Information related to such purchase shall be governed solely by the applicable independent third party company’s privacy policy.  You further acknowledge and agree that Meta+Games will have no liability for or control over such independent third party company’s use or protection of your Personal Financial Information. You should check the privacy policy of the independent third party company’s web site to determine how it will handle any Personal Financial Information it collects or processes from you.</p>

      <p>You acknowledge and agree that in the event that such independent third party company experiences a data breach that compromises or otherwise affects your Personal Financial Information, Meta+Games shall in no way be responsible or liable to you for such breach. You should contact the applicable independent third party company regarding any such data breach.</p>

      <h3>THIRD PARTY SITES; THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING COMPANIES</h3>
      <p>The Service may include links to web sites operated by other companies, and content within the Service may be hosted or served by other web sites. The Service also carries advertisements from other companies.  Advertisements embedded within or made available through the Service and these other web sites maintain their own privacy policies regarding cookies, web beacons and personal information.  It is your responsibility to review those policies.</p>

      <h3>STORAGE OF INFORMATION &amp; TRANSFER OF DATA ABROAD</h3>
      <p>If you are accessing the Service from a country other than the country in which our servers are located (currently the United States of America) the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By using the Service and communicating electronically with us, you consent to the processing and transfer of your data as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h3>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
      <p>We use the information collected through the Service: (i) to communicate with you; (ii) to process your requests and transactions; (iii) to improve the Service; (iv) to customize the services or products we provide to you; (v) to assist with our product and service development; (vi) to perform marketing analysis; and (vii) for other purposes related to our business.</p>

      <p>Also, we may use the information we have collected together with information collected by a partner, advertiser or other person/entity with whom you or we do business.</p>

      <h3>WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
      <p>Personal information collected through the Service or advertisements hosted by us, may be shared with our affiliates, companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf (for example, companies that process Personal Financial Information or companies that provide data management or other support services to us (such as data storage and web hosting services)) and third party advertising companies.</p>

      <p>Also, we may disclose the personal information we collect through the Service when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to: (i) comply with applicable law or other judicial or administrative process (or a court order or subpoena); (ii) prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (iii) enforce our Terms of Service or other agreements that govern your use of the Service or our services; or (iv) to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or others.</p>

      <p>Personal information submitted to the Service or collected by us is our asset and will become part of our normal business records.  Your personal information and other data collected by us may be transferred to another company that has acquired our stock or assets, for example, as a result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation.  If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company’s use of your personal information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.</p>


      <h3>MODIFYING YOUR INFORMATION; OPT-OUT / OUT-IN</h3>
      <p>We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use and disclose your personal information.  You can terminate your account at any time by clicking on the “Delete Account” link within the Service which will remove Your Profile and other personal information from public view.  You can edit Your Profile information and change your privacy preferences at any time by going to the “profile settings” page which is accessible by clicking on the “Settings” button within the Service.  In addition, you can edit your information or change your privacy preferences at any time by emailing us at <a href="privacy@metalevelgames.com">privacy@metalevelgames.com</a>.</p>

      <p>You may “opt-out” of receiving promotional emails from us by following the instructions in those emails. Opt-out requests will not apply to transactional service communications including, but not limited to, messages about your registration.</p>


      <h3>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
      <p>We take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information (including, preventing the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction of your personal information). Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are impenetrable.
      If you use a password for the Service, you are responsible for keeping it confidential. Do not share it with any other person. If you believe your password has been misused, please advise us immediately.</p>

      <h3>MINORS</h3>
      <p>THIS SERVICE IS NOT MEANT FOR MINORS. We are committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests. The Service is not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and we do not target the Service to children under 13.</p>

      <p>We may not intend to collect or solicit information from people who are minors. However, as a condition of use for minors in those countries or regions where information gathering from minors is considered illegal, guardians will be responsible for accompanying minors for prevention of any unexpected circumstances when they access the Service.</p>
