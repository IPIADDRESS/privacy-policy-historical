As such, PlagiarismDetect.com adheres to the privacy principles enforced at PlagiarismDetect.com. Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this Privacy Statement explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected and used. This Privacy Statement applies to all personally identifiable information collected or submitted on the PlagiarismDetect.com web site (the "Site"). To make this Privacy Statement easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. Although this Site provides links to third-party web sites, they are not covered by this Privacy Statement. PlagiarismDetect.com assumes no responsibility for the privacy or security of information you provide to any third party through linked web sites or any other means. By using this Site, you agree that you have reviewed and understood our Terms of Use and this Privacy Statement to your full satisfaction, that you accept and are subject to our Usage Policy and this Privacy Statement, and that PlagiarismDetect.com is permitted to use your personal information as set forth below.
<br><br>
<div class="privacy_number">1</div><h1>Personal Information</h1>
<h2>Registration</h2>

Personal information is requested for registration to our service for the following purposes: 1. To verify the identity of a registrant in relation to their authority to register a specific academic institution. 2. To obtain the most complete contact information for administration of the registrant's account. 3. To inform the registrant of changes in PlagiarismDetect.com functionality, PlagiarismDetect.com auxiliary services, and PlagiarismDetect.com promotions. 

<h2>Trial</h2>
Personal information is requested for trial use of our service for the following purposes: 1. To inform the trial user of changes in PlagiarismDetect.com functionality, PlagiarismDetect.com auxiliary services, and PlagiarismDetect.com promotions. 2. To request trial user's evaluation and recommendations for the PlagiarismDetect.com service.

<h2>Paper Submission</h2>
Personal information is requested for access to our paper submission web pages for the following purposes: 1. To identify the individual connected to any uploaded manuscript. 2. To provide receipt and confirmation of successful text uploads. The type of information we request is connected to the above-noted purposes. For example, we collect contact information such as name, IP address, and email address for a registered user in order to facilitate use of the PlagiarismDetect.com service and facilitate customer relations. In addition to the specific uses noted above, PlagiarismDetect.com also uses your personal information to process your requests and transactions, offer or furnish additional products and services, personalize the types of information you receive from PlagiarismDetect.com, assess trends in the use of our Site or purchases of products or services, facilitate market research and statistical studies, develop content and functionality that helps us serve our customers' needs, and improve the service and products we provide. PlagiarismDetect.com may also use your personal information to prevent harm or injury, to prevent fraud, to protect our legal interests, to comply with or respond to legal process, and to comply with applicable laws. Access to your personal information by 3rd parties will only occur with the signed confirmation from the registered user, as stated in the agreement on the registration page. This approval includes, but is not limited to, one registered user allowing PlagiarismDetect.com to provide his or her contact information to another registered user for document source analysis tracking. For example, if material uploaded to our database matches material from a later upload, contact information related to the former is given to the latter upload's registered user for follow-up. As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets, or PlagiarismDetect.com might be acquired by another company. In any of those circumstances, personal information in our databases may be included among the transferred assets.
