Capitalized terms in this Policy not otherwise defined herein have the same meanings as the definitions of those terms in the User Agreement.</p><h3>A note for children under 13 years old.</h3><p>Plastiq does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through this Website. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on this Website without their permission.

Please note that access to your payment history requires validation of your e-mail address.</p><p>Registered Plastiq users, in addition to easily sending immediate payments to our Merchants, may schedule and manage future payments and store credit card data for later use.</p><h3>Exclusions</h3><p>This Policy does not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to us via this Website or any other means.

If we ever intend to use your information in a manner that is not consistent with this Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the information is collected via explicit electronic notification. This includes but is not limited to: email notifications, SMS notifications, on-site alerts, modal windows, and other mechanisms that Plastiq may elect to utilize.</p><h3>Other Information</h3><p>We use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to your computer or mobile device.

Cookies help provide additional functionality to the Website and help us analyze Website usage more accurately.

Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Platform or emails.

We may contact you via email, mail and/or through SMSs or text messages. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. This will permanently remove your contact information from all future out-going correspondences. Additionally, if for any reason you find our "opt-out" instructions unclear, and wish to cease receiving any communications from Plastiq, or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as at <a href="mailto:privacy@plastiq.com">privacy@plastiq.com</a>. We retain the right to contact you regarding your use of the Services.</p><p>Plastiq will occasionally conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Data and other information provided to us.

Importantly, this aggregate information cannot be used to personally identify any Plastiq user or users. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Platform to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p><h2 id="part5">Does Plastiq ever disclose Personal Data or other information?</h2><p>Plastiq does not sell or rent your Personal Data to marketers or third parties for marketing purposes.</p><p>Like many companies, we sometimes share information with trusted third parties to perform functions related to this Website and our Platform.

We take efforts to limit the amount of information that is shared with third parties to what is necessary to accomplish the specific business purpose.</p><p>We may disclose your Personal Data to law enforcement, government officials, regulators and/or other third parties from the jurisdiction in which you reside or from other foreign jurisdictions if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of this Website or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p><p>In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</p><p>From time to time we may employ third parties to help us improve the Website and/or the Services. These third parties may have limited access to databases of user information solely for the purpose of helping us to improve the Website and/or the Services.</p><h2 id="part6">How does Plastiq secure Personal Data?</h2><p>Credit and debit card data is stored and managed in compliance with strict Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards. Plastiq utilizes tokenization, a payments industry-standard procedure, to limit exposure of sensitive cardholder data. Your credit and/or debit card information is sent directly to our secure, encrypted data vault, which generates a random, cryptographically secure token that is used by our payment application to submit payments on your card. Once information is deposited into the vault, it cannot be directly retrieved by our payment application or any third parties.</p><p>Although no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed 100% secure and error free, Plastiq takes great care to protect Personal Data collected via this Website from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, in both transit and at rest.

Connections to this Website are secured with an Extended Validation (EV) SSL certificate with 256-bit encryption, and our data centers, located in the United States, boast enterprise-level security with top-level industry certifications and fault-tolerant, distributed systems. Other security safeguards include, but are not limited to, encrypted vault storage for sensitive data, strict hardware firewalls, and limited physical access to buildings, servers, and files.</p><p>As our data centers are located in Canada, your Personal Data may be available to the Canadian government or its agencies under a lawful order, irrespective of the safeguards we have put in place for the protection of your Personal Data.</p><p>We at Plastiq do our best to secure your data, and we ask that you take reasonable precautions as well. Ensure your personal computing device has up-to-date security and anti-virus software, and please consider carefully what information you choose to send anyone via the Internet and log of your account when you are finished using the Services and do not share your password with anyone.</p><h2 id="part7">How are updates to this Policy handled?</h2><p>This Website and Services may change from time to time, which may necessitate revisions to this Policy.
