				explains what information PlaySushi, which is owned by Future Ads LLC, 
				(referred to herein as "PlaySushi",
				"Company", "we", "us", or "our") collects from individuals who
				visit the PlaySushi.com website (the "Site") and/or participate in the resources offered
				by PlaySushi ("User(s)" or "you"). This Policy
				also explains how the Company uses and maintains that information.
				</p>
				<p>
				PlaySushi has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have 
				been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy-program-requirements/" target="_blank">TRUSTe's program requirements</a> including transparency, accountability

				<p>
				<b>Changes to this Privacy Policy </b>
				</p>
				<p>
				If we decide to change our privacy practices, we will post those changes 
				to this Policy and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware 
				of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, 
				if any, we disclose it. <br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
				We reserve the right to update or
				modify this Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we
				make material changes to this Policy, we will notify you here, by
				email, or by means of a notice on the Site's home page.
				</p>
		
				<p>
				This Policy applies only to
				information collected on the Site and not to information collected
				or obtained from other sources.
				</p>
		
				<p>
				We collect two kinds of information
				through the Site. The first kind is information that can identify you
				as a specific individual - such as your name and email address
				("Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII"). 
				We only collect PII when you have contacted us
				directly or forwarded content from the Site to someone else, such as 
				when you use our "Send Game to Friend" feature. (See
				"Collection of Personally Identifiable Information" below).
				The second kind of information is the kind of non-personally
				identifiable information ("NPII") collected and stored
				automatically by many websites. It includes, for example, information
				about your Internet service provider, operating system, type of
				browser, geographic location, and pages viewed on the Site. Although
				this information is related to you, it is not associated with your
				PII and cannot be linked to you personally.  If you register to play
				"Premium Games", the NPII collected may also include your
				IP address and HTML information about the content of web pages you
				visit.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				If you do not want your information to
				continue
				to be collected and used as provided in this Policy, you should not
				access or use the Site again.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Premium Game players ("Premium User(s)") have access to the 
				Premium Games at no charge in exchange for their agreement to install 
				the PlaySushi software (the "Software") on their computers 
				or other computing device. The Software allows us to display third party 
				applications as well as  text link, popup/under, transitional and banner  
				advertisements based on the web content viewed by that User. No PII is 
				collected through the Software. In addition, the Site and Premium Games 
				may display advertisements from third parties before and/or during gameplay. 
				All third party applications and such advertisements from the Software, 
				Site and Premium games shall collectively be known as "Third Party Content". 
				Your dealings with Third Party Content, including, but not limited to, your 
				interaction with its advertisements and promotions, purchase of its goods, or any other 
				type of involvement, are solely between you and the third party. Therefore we do not 
				endorse the advertisements, products or other materials of the Third Party Content. 
				If you interact with the Third Party Content, their terms and conditions and privacy 
				policies apply to your rights and obligations with respect to such interaction. 
				Accordingly, such third parties may collect personal or non-personal information about you. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<b>Collection of Personally
				Identifiable Information </b>
				</p>
				<p>
				PII is collected by PlaySushi only
				when you provide it to us by using one of the following Site
				features:
				</p>
				<ul style="padding: 10px 20px; list-style: disc outside none;">
					<li><p>
					When you communicate
					with us via the "Contact Us" page, the Site asks for
					your name and email address so that you can receive a
					response.
					</p>
					</li><li><p>
					When you use our "Send Game to
					Friend" feature, PlaySushi collects the name and email address
					of you and your friend. We will only send your friend a onetime
					email inviting them to visit the site and check out the game that
					you sent them. We do not retain their PII for any purpose.
					</p>
				</li></ul>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
				<b>Social Media (Features) and Widgets:</b>
				</p>
				<p>
				The Site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like 
				button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs 
				that run on the Site. These features may collect your IP address, which page 
				you are visiting on the Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to 
				function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a 
				third party or hosted directly on the Site. Your interactions with these 
				Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
				</p>
		
				<p>
				If you do not want us to collect your
				PII as described above or to use and share your PII as described
				further below in this Policy, you should NOT provide it to us through
				any of the Site features described above. By providing us with
				your PII using any of these features, you are authorizing our use and
				sharing of your PII as described in this Policy and any subsequent
				revisions to this Policy that we may publish on the Site.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<b>Updating Your Personally
				Identifiable Information. </b>
				</p>
				<p>
				If your PII changes, or if you no
				longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, or remove
				it by emailing our Customer Support at 
<script type="text/javascript">

				or by contacting us using our contact form 
				<a href="Contact.ps">here</a>.
				</p>
		
				<p>
				We will retain your information for as

</script>.
				We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with
				our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
				</p>
		
				<p>
				<b>Children's Privacy</b>
				</p>
				<p>
				We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under 13
				years of age. We cannot and will not independently verify that all of our Users are at least 13 years old, 
				but we will remove from our files any PII of anyone we discover to be under 13 years old.
				</p>
			
				<p>
				<b>Use and Sharing of Personally
				Identifiable Information</b></p>
				<p>
				We reserve the right to use PII: 
				(1) for the specific purpose for which such information was provided as stated above; 
				(2) for the purposes disclosed at the time such information is provided; and 
				(3) as otherwise stated  in this Policy.		 
				</p>
		
				<p>
				We do not share, sell or trade any of your PII with any third parties other than described herein. 
				We may share your PII with our parent company and its principals, employees, consultants, officers, directors, members, agents, subsidiaries, or affiliates (collectively "Related Companies"). 
				Neither we nor our Related Companies contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to your PII.
				</p>
		
				<p>
				We and our Related Companies may provide access to your PII when legally required to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, 
				to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, 
				property or safety of other users or the public.
				</p>
		
				<p>
				We and/or our Related Companies may also disclose your PII to outside companies and consultants that help bring you the services we offer. 
				For example, we and our Related Companies may work with outside companies and consultants to: (a) manage a database of customer information; 
				(b) assist in distributing e-mails; (c) assist with direct marketing and data collection; (d) provide data storage and analysis; 
				(e) provide fraud prevention; (f) provide customer service by phone; and/or (g) provide other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential and maintaining our Site. 
				We and our Related Companies require that these outside companies and consultants agree to keep confidential all information we share with them, and use the information only to perform their obligations to us.
				</p>
		
				<p>
				In addition, if we or our Related Companies go through a
				business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another
				company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your PII will
				likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified by a
				prominent notice on the PlaySushi home page of any such change in
				ownership or control of your PII.  We also reserve the right to
				disclose PII as required by law and when we believe that disclosure
				is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial
				proceeding, court order, or legal process.
				</p>
		
				<p>
				<b>Non-Personally Identifiable
				Information </b>
				</p>
				<p>
				As with many websites, when you visit
				the Site, it automatically gathers certain NPII based on
				your computer information and stores it in log files. This type of
				technical and statistical information is used to customize your
				experience at the Site, to help us improve the quality of
				the Site and to make your visits easy, convenient and
				fun. PlaySushi also collects your IP address to help diagnose
				problems with the Site server and for Site administration purposes.
				</p>
		
				<p>
				In addition to the general collection of NPII by the Site (including, 
				but not limited to, IP address, browser type, operating system version, 
				time and date stamp, and landing page), the Software collects your IP addresses, 
				browser information, URLs, HTML, web pages and/or search queries on the web 
				pages you visit. We may use this NPII to assist us in delivering to you more 
				relevant content in the form of third party applications and/or text link, 
				pop-up/under, transitional, and banner advertisements which appear when you are 
				online generally. We may also work with third party advertising networks and 
				advertisers who help deliver such content to you. We may share your NPII and/or 
				aggregated information with third parties to improve the relevancy of such content. 
				These third party advertising networks and advertisers may also use cookies and 
				other technologies to collect and track NPII such as demographic information, 
				aggregated information, and Internet activity to assist them in delivering content 
				that is more relevant to your interests. They may also utilize supplemental data 
				from other sources and analytics methods to help deliver more relevant content. 
				If at any time, a Premium User no longer wants the Software to collect NPII or to 
				deliver customized advertising, s/he may deactivate the Software which will uninstall 
				the Software and its associated monitoring technologies. The directions for uninstalling 
				the Software are set forth below in the section entitled "Deactivate Software".<br>
				You can opt out of the use of your NPII from being used by Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") members. 
				The NAI opt-out tool was developed in conjunction with NAI members for the express purpose of allowing consumers 
				to "opt out" of the behavioral advertising delivered by NAI members. If you opt-out of the use of your NPII 
				from being used by NAI members, you will continue to receive ads, however, it will prevent NAI members from 
				delivering ads tailored to your preferences and usage patterns. If you opt out of Interest-Based Advertising 
				(as defined here) by one or more NAI member company, that choice will be stored in "opt-out cookies."  If you 
				ever delete opt-out cookies from your browser (such as by clearing all cookies), buy a new computer, or change 
				web browsers, you'll need to renew your opt-out choices. NAI member companies need to be able to read an 
				"opt-out" cookie on your browser to know not to collect and use data for interest-based advertising purposes. 
				For more information or to opt-out click http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. 				
				</p>
		
				<p>
				<b>Cookies</b></p>
				<p>
				The Site uses "cookies"
				and similar means to collect aggregate Internet traffic statistics
				and to enhance your experience at the Site. A cookie is a small text
				file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies
				contain information that can later be read by a web server in the
				domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run
				programs or deliver viruses to your computer. The Site uses cookies
				to recognize your preferences, temporarily store session information
				(such as your login to a download or support area), and to remember
				you when you register for our products and/or services. This helps
				save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same
				information and to display your customized content and advertising on
				your later visits to the Site. It also allows you to move from page
				to page at the Site without having to sign in again on each page. If
				you do not want the Site to deploy cookies in your browser, you can
				set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website
				tries to put a cookie in your browser software. If you choose to
				decline cookies, however, you may not be able to fully experience the
				interactive features of the Site and it may affect your ability to
				use some of the products and/or services at the Site. We do not tie

				<p>
				<b>Third Party Cookies</b></p>
				<p>
				The use of cookies by our third party
				advertisers as well as third party ad servers is not covered by our
				privacy policy (as explained in the NPII section above). 
				We do not have access or control over these cookies.
				These third parties use session ID cookies to gather anonymous
				information.
				</p>
		
				<p>
				<b>Web Beacons</b></p>
				<p>
				The Site may contain electronic images
				known as "web beacons" which are also sometimes called
				single-pixel gifs. Web beacons may be used to assist in delivering
				cookies, allow us to count Users who have visited the Site pages and
				to deliver services via the Site. We may also include web beacons in
				email messages or newsletters you agree to receive in order to
				determine whether such messages have been opened and acted upon. If
				any partner advertises on the Site, we may work with them to place
				web beacons on their website to allow PlaySushi to collect
				statistics on how often clicking on those advertisements on the Site
				results in a purchase or other action on such partner's
				website. PlaySushi may also employ web beacons from third party
				partners in order to help compile aggregated statistics regarding the
				effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations of the
				Site. PlaySushi will never allow web beacons on the Site to be used
				by third parties (other than Related Companies) to collect or access your personal information. We
				do not tie web beacons to any PII you submit while on our Site.
				</p>
		
				<p>
				<b>Use and Sharing of Non-Personally
				Identifiable Information (NPII)</b>
				</p>
				We do not share, sell or trade any of your NPII with any third parties other than described herein. 
				We may share your NPII with our Related Companies. Neither we nor our Related Companies contribute to 
				or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to your NPII.
				<p></p>
				<p>
				We and our Related Companies may provide access to your NPII to third parties when legally required to do so, 
				to allow third party advertising networks to serve you more relevant ads as described above, to cooperate with 
				police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site 
				and/or to limit our legal liability and protect our rights.
				</p>
				<p>
				We and/or our Related Companies may also disclose your NPII to outside companies and consultants that help bring you the services we offer. 
				For example, we and our Related Companies may work with outside companies and consultants to: (a) manage a database of customer information; 
				(b) assist in distributing e-mails; (c) assist with direct marketing and data collection; (d) provide data storage and analysis; 
				(e) provide fraud prevention; (f) provide customer service by phone; and/or 
				(g) provide other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential and maintaining our Site. 
				We and our Related Companies require that these outside companies and consultants agree to keep confidential all information we share with them, 
				and use the information only to perform their obligations to us.
				</p>
				<p>
				In addition, if we or our Related Companies go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, 
				or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your NPII will likely be among the assets transferred. 
				You will be notified by a prominent notice on the PlaySushi home page of any such change in ownership or control of your NPII. 
				We also reserve the right to disclose NPII as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect 
				our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
				</p>
		
				<p>
				<b>Security</b></p>
				<p>
				We have implemented technical,
				administrative and physical security measures to protect Information
				from unauthorized access and improper use. We keep information on
				servers that are protected by firewalls and located in a physically
				secure facility accessible only to our authorized employees and personnel of the Related Companies. From time to
				time, we review our security procedures in order to consider
				appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though, that,
				despite our reasonable efforts, no security measures are impenetrable
				and any information transmitted to us or
				through the Site  will be at your own risk.
				</p>
		
				<p>
				<b>Opt-Out of PlaySushi Emails</b>
		
				</p>
				<p>
				If you are receiving emails from
				PlaySushi, it is because we understood from your participation on
				our Site that you were interested in receiving ongoing information
				from us. If at any point you no longer want to receive emails from
				PlaySushi, you may at any time go to the Unsubscribe page on
				PlaySushi and follow the 'opt out' directions there. If you have
				any questions about the opt-out process, you can contact us at

/*]]>*/
</script>.
				 Also, please note that if we have already shared your information
				with one of our business partners, unsubscribing from our list will
				not prevent these third parties from emailing you. You will have to
				send an opt-out request to those third parties directly.
				Opportunities to "opt out" from receiving emails are
				usually found on these companies' websites or within each of their
				email communications.

				<p>
				<b>Links from the Site</b>
		
				</p>
				<p>
				The Site provides links to the websites of many third parties. 
				If you click through to any of these third party web sites, our Policy 
				will not apply to your use of, and activities on, those third party sites. 
				We encourage you to read the legal notices posted on these sites, including 
				but not limited to their privacy policies. We shall have no responsibility or 
				liability for your visitation to, and the data collection and use practices of, 
				these sites. All inquiries concerning the use of PII by a third party must be 
				communicated to that third party and not to PlaySushi.
				</p>
		
				<p>
				<b>Deactivate Software</b>
				</p>
				<p>
				Premium Users who have downloaded the
				Software and who do not want their NPII collected as described above
				should immediately deactivate the Software. You may deactivate the
				Software by going to <a href="Deactivate.ps">Deactivate</a>
				and following the directions to remove the Software from your
				computer, or by selecting the appropriate entry in your Control Panel
				using the "Add or Remove Programs" icon. Deactivating the
				Software means that you will no longer have access to the Premium
				Games on the Site.
