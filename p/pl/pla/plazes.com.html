        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <h2>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This privacy policy pertains to the use of the Plazes Service at <a href="http://plazes.com/">http://plazes.com/</a></li>
            <li>This privacy policy covers how Plazes treats personal information that Plazes collects and receives. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number.</li>
            <li>Children under 18 are not permitted to use the Plazes service, and so this privacy policy makes no provision for children's use of the site.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information Collection and How it is used</h2>

        <h3>General Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Plazes collects personal information when you register with Plazes to use Plazes services or to post content on Plazes.</li>
            <li>When you register we ask you only for your E-Mail address and a nickname (pseudonym).</li>
            <li>You can optionally enter information such as your name, address, birth date, gender, icq/aim/msn user names and links to blogs and other communities.</li>
            <li>Plazes automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser and the Plazes Launcher, including your IP address, ambiant technical data (your default gateway's MAC ID, GSM/3G cellId, Wifi access points MAC ID, GPS coordinates etc.), cookie, and the page you request.</li>
            <li>Plazes uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, research, and anonymous reporting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>IP Addresses</h3>
        <p>IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. Your IP address is stored in our log files.</p>
        <p>IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To diagnose or service technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.</li>
            <li>To tailor advertising based on geographic area or other information derived from your IP address. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.</li>
            <li>To estimate the total number of users visiting Plazes from specific geographical regions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ambient Data</h3>
        <p>The Plazer Software (the "Plazer") may use available ambient data as the default gateway's MAC ID in your LAN ("Mac ID"), identification of GSM/3G cell towers ('Cell ID'), MAC IDs of Wifi access points ("AP MAC ID") and GPS coordinates of attached GPS receivers ("GPS") to guess your location.
        Plazes <strong class="important">does not track your location unless you explicitly choose to do so</strong> by voluntary check-in to a specific location. Ambient data is used by Plazes to provide preselection of relevant locations to simplify the check-in process.</p>
