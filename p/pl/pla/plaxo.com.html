<h2><font size="+2">• </font>Plaxo is committed to protecting your privacy
  and the privacy of individuals in your contact list ("Your Contact List").
  Plaxo does not use or disclose any of Your Information (defined in the paragraph below)
  without your permission.</h2>
<h3>Here's how it works</h3>
<p class="body" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">When you download Plaxo Contacts™ and join Plaxo Contact Networks™ you provide us with "Your Account Information,"
  "Your Plaxo Cards" and "Your Contact List," each as described in detail below (together, "Your Information"). You can then elect to have Plaxo update and maintain Your Contact List.
  </p><ol style="text-align: justify" start="1" type="1">
  <li><b>Your Account Information</b>: your name and your email address are
  <u>required</u> by Plaxo in order to provide you with the Plaxo Contacts™
  product and the Plaxo Contact Networks™ service (and other possible Services
  to which you decide to subscribe). Plaxo will also ask you to provide a private
  password and a challenge question and answer, which will become part of Your
  Account Information.</li>
  </ol>
  <ol style="text-align: justify" start="2" type="1">
  <li><b>Your Plaxo Cards</b>: when you join Plaxo Contact Networks™, you can
  create Your Plaxo Cards to store contact information about yourself (e.g.,
  your name, your email address, your phone number, your address). You may
  then choose to share Your Plaxo Cards with the individuals on Your Contact
  List and/or others on the Plaxo Contact Networks™ as you see fit. </li>
  </ol>
  <ol style="text-align: justify" start="3" type="1">
  <li><b>Your Contact List</b>: when you join Plaxo Contact Networks™ you also
  have the option to store a copy of Your Contact List on Plaxo's secure servers,
  rather than just on your computer. Your Contact List will not be shared with
  anyone and will only be used to provide you with secure, web-based access
  to its data and to run the Plaxo Contact Networks™ (e.g., send update messages)
  at your request.</li>
  </ol>
<h3 class="body" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">Your Information is your own and you decide who will have
  access to it.</h3>
  <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">Specifically:</p>
  <ol style="text-align: justify" start="1" type="1">
  <li><b>Your Account Information</b>: this information is stored on Plaxo's
  secure servers and is not shared with any outside parties. If you <a href="http://support.plaxo.com/bin/answer.py?answer=54">forget your password</a>, you will be asked to go to the Plaxo Web site and create a new one.
  No plain text passwords will ever be passed through email.</li>
  </ol>
  <ol style="text-align: justify" start="2" type="1">
  <li><b>Your Plaxo Cards</b>: you specify the information that is contained
  in Your Plaxo Cards and determine whether they are public or private. The
  Plaxo Cards which you mark as private are not accessible by anyone without
  your specific permission. The Plaxo Cards which you mark as public are accessible
  by those Plaxo members ("Members") who list you in their own "Contact Lists"
  and/or who know your email address. In the download and install process,
  Plaxo's default is to keep your personal card private and make your business
  card public. You must uncheck the "public" box on your business card template
  in order to keep it private.</li>
  </ol>
  <ol style="text-align: justify" start="3" type="1">
  <li><b>Your Contact List</b>: you can elect not to store your entire contact
  list on Plaxo's servers, except to the extent needed to run the Services you
  choose to use (names and email addresses). </li>
  </ol>
<h3 class="body" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">We do not sell, exchange or give Your Information to any third-parties.</h3>
  <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">We use Your Information:</p>
  <ul type="square">
  <li> To enable you to use the Plaxo Contact Networks™; </li>
  <li> For license reporting and assessment of service levels; and/or </li>
  <li>To better understand on
  an aggregated basis how our products are used, gauge traffic patterns and
  determine what types of content and services are most popular with users
  of our products and services. </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">Additionally, we use Your Account Information:</p>
  <ul type="square">
  <li>To verify access rights to content, services or software; </li>
  <li>To provide you with information about Plaxo products, services, news and
  events through the Software, the Site or email; </li>
  <li>To allow you to purchase and download Plaxo products and services; and/or</li>
  <li>To provide you with personalized content programming, instructions and
  services.</li>
  </ul>
<h2><font size="+2">• </font>How we use Cookies and Log Files.</h2>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">In order to improve the Services and the Site, we use "cookies"
  when you are logged into the Site using your email address and password.
  A cookie is a piece of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server
  and can only be understood by the server that gave it to you. It functions
  as your computer's identification token and enables Plaxo to personalize your
  experience when you are signed in to the Services. The cookie also contains
  your email address so that we can make it easier for you to sign in. If you
  reject the cookie, you may not be able to sign up for some of the Services
  or use certain features of the Site.</p>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">Most browsers are initially
  set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive
  a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. (For some
  Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users
  choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.)</p>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">While Plaxo uses cookies to enable
  you to use the Services and the Site, and our Web servers automatically log
  the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your computer, Plaxo does not use
  this information to identify you personally except to provide you with the
  features of the Services.</p>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">Like most Internet services,
  we use log files, both on the client and server side. The data held in log
  files includes your IP address, browser type, email application, Internet
  service provider ("ISP"), referring/exit Web pages, computer platform type,
  date/time stamp, and user activity. Plaxo uses the log data to analyze trends,
  administer the Services and the Site, and gather broad usage information for
  aggregate use. IP addresses are tied to neither Your Information nor any
  other Personally Identifiable Information. </p>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">The Software has associated log and temporary files that
  are stored on your local hard drive and on Plaxo's servers. These files store
  Your Account Information, your permissions, preference settings and system
  notifications as well as other data necessary to operate the Plaxo Contact
  Networks™. Your Information resides locally in the email application you
  designate to work with the Services and the Software, as well as in Plaxo's
  servers, except if you have chosen not to store Your Contact List on Plaxo's
  servers for web access. Note that even if you have chosen not to store your
  Contact List on Plaxo's servers, this information will need to be temporarily
  copied to these servers whenever you choose to send update email requests
  to people in your Contact List (i.e., this information is necessary to send
  the update request). As soon as the email request has been processed, this
  information is deleted from these servers.</p>
<h2><font size="+2">• </font>We will provide you with Member communications
  as you permit.</h2>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">We send all new Members
  confirmation emails verifying the ownership of the email addresses provided
  in Your Account Information. We also communicate with you to provide requested
  services and in regards to issues relating to your account.</p>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">Members may occasionally
  receive information on Plaxo products, services, news and events. Out of
  respect for your privacy, we present you with the option to not receive these
  communications (link to your account Preferences on the web site).</p>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">On rare occasions it is
  necessary to send out a strictly service-related announcement which is not
  promotional in nature. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended
  for maintenance we might send you such a notification. Generally, you may
  not opt-out of these communications, though you can deactivate your account.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%"><font size="+2">• </font>Limited Data Sharing with Third Parties.</h2>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">We may share aggregated and anonymous demographic information
  with our business partners but no such information can be linked directly
  to Your Account Information, Your Plaxo Cards, Your Contact List or other
  personally identifiable information.</p>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">Though we make reasonable efforts
  to preserve your privacy (and that of your contacts), we may need to disclose
  personally identifiable information when required by law wherein we have a
  good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial
  proceeding, a court order or legal process served on Plaxo and/or the Site.</p>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">In the event Plaxo goes
  through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition or the sale of
  a portion of its assets, Your Information and your membership in the Plaxo
  Contact Networks™ will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
  You will be notified of an ownership change pursuant to Notification of Changes section
  of the privacy statement.</p>
<h2><font size="+2">• </font>Links.</h2>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">The Site contains, and
  the Software may present, links to other sites. Please be aware that Plaxo
  is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage
  you to be aware when you leave the Site or otherwise link to other sites,
  to read the privacy policies of each and every site that collects personally
  identifiable information. Plaxo's Privacy Policy applies solely to information
  collected by the Services, the Software or the Site. </p>
<h2><font size="+2">• </font>Plaxo is Committed to Protecting Your
  Privacy.</h2>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">When you submit Your Information
  via the Software or the Site, Your Information is protected in several ways.
  The Services use Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") for all client-server communication
  using Your Information. Your Web-based access to Your Information is protected
  by an encrypted password. We recommend that you do not disclose the password
  to anyone. Additionally, Your Information resides on a firewall-protected
  server that only selected Plaxo personnel have access to via password. Plaxo
  strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing Your Information.</p>
<h2><font size="+2">• </font>Children's Privacy.</h2>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">Plaxo is committed to
  protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take
  an active role in their children's online activities and interests. Plaxo's Services, Software
  and Site are not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13. Plaxo does
  not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and Plaxo does not target
  its Services, Software and Site to children under 13.</p>
<h2><font size="+2">• </font>Personal Information of Others.</h2>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">Your Information may
  include contact and other personal information in Your Contact List for individuals who
  have not joined Plaxo Contact Networks™ or who are otherwise not Plaxo users. Plaxo is
  committed to protecting the privacy rights of these individuals. We will not sell, exchange
  or give information in Your Contact List regarding such individuals to any third-parties.
  We may receive requests from such individuals to remove their personal information from
  Your Contact List. In such event, we may encourage them to contact you directly or we may
  relay such request to you on behalf of such individuals. We will not alter or remove any
  information regarding such individuals from Your Contact List without your consent.</p>
<h2><font size="+2">• </font>Correcting/Updating/Deleting Information.</h2>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">You have the right to
  access and correct, update, and/or delete Your Information at any time. You
  can do so by using the Software on your desktop or by signing into your account on the Site.</p>
<h2><b><font size="+2">• </font></b>Notification of Changes.</h2>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">If we decide to change the Privacy Policy, we will post those
  changes on the Site's homepage, and other places we deem appropriate, so that
  you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under
  what circumstances -- if any -- we disclose it. We will use Your Information
  in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected. </p>
  <p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">If, however, we plan to use Your Information in a manner different
  from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you. You will have
  a choice as to whether or not we use Your Information in this different manner.
  However, if you have declined member communications, deleted or deactivated
  your account with the Services, then you will not be contacted, nor will Your
  Information be used in this new manner.</p>
<p class="body_small" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">In addition, if we make any material changes to our privacy practices
  that do not affect Your Information already stored on Plaxo's servers, we will
  post a prominent notice on the Site notifying you of the change. In some cases
  where we post such a notice we will also contact you, if you have opted to receive
  member communications from us, notifying you of the changes to our privacy practices.</p>
