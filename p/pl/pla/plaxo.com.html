<h2>Summary (<a href="#full">Jump to Full Policy</a>)</h2>


<h1>What the Privacy Policy does</h1>

<p>The Web Services Privacy Policy describes the information Comcast collects
about you, how Comcast uses that information, and how Comcast protects your
privacy when you use the Websites and the services and software we offer here: <a href="http://www.comcast.net/">www.comcast.net</a>, <a href="http://customer.comcast.com/">customer.comcast.com</a>, <a href="http://www.tunerfish.com/">www.tunerfish.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.plaxo.com/">www.plaxo.com</a>.</p>

<p>This summary gives you some key points from the Privacy Policy, but you
should read the whole Privacy Policy to get a full understanding of our privacy
practices. </p>

<h1>What the Privacy Policy does not do</h1>

<p>Please note: the Privacy Policy <i><u>does not</u></i> tell you what
information we collect and how we use it when you use other Comcast services
(Comcast Digital Cable with On Demand, Comcast Digital Voice, Comcast High
Speed Internet, XFINITY TV, XFINITY Voice, or XFINITY Internet). These services
have their own privacy policy, which we post at <a href="http://www.comcast.com/customerprivacy">http://www.comcast.com/customerprivacy</a>/
and mail to subscribers. </p>

<div>

<p><a href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.plaxo.com&amp;sealid=102" target="_blank"><img id="truste" class="right" alt="TRUSTe Logo" src="/img/truste_seal_ctv.gif"></a></p>

<h1>The TRUSTe Seal</h1>

<p>All of our Websites set forth in this Privacy Policy post the TRUSTe Seal.
This means that TRUSTe has reviewed the privacy practices on these Websites,
and you can contact TRUSTe about a privacy concern if we don't resolve it to
your satisfaction. </p>

</div>

<h1>The Information Comcast Collects and How It is Used and Shared</h1>

<p>We want you to understand what kinds of information may be collected about
your use of the Websites and Web Services, and what we might do with that
information.</p>

<p>Comcast collects two types of information from people who use its Websites:
(i) information that identifies a particular person using a Website, and (ii)
information that provides facts about a person without identifying him or her. </p>

<div>

<h2>Information that Identifies Someone</h2>

<p>Information that identifies a particular person could be a name, address or
Social Security number, for example. We will not share this information with an
advertiser, and we will not share it with another Website or company, unless
you tell us to (for example, if you want to post information from your Plaxo
page on your Facebook page or you want to use Tunerfish to tell your Twitter
network about a television show you are watching). </p>

<p>We also use this kind of identifying information to provide services to you.
For example, we may use it to bill you for services, to check your credit, to
confirm your identity when you login, or to communicate with you. Sometimes we
use other companies to help us provide our services. We may share your
information with these companies, but they are required to protect it and to
use it only to provide services to you.</p>

<h2>Information that Does Not Identify a Specific Person</h2>

<p>Information that <i>does not</i> identify a person could be a non-personal record
of online activity, or information you put in a profile - like your zip code,
your age or your gender (when it's used without your name). We routinely collect
this kind of information and use it to improve your experience, -for example,
by showing you content and advertising that may be more relevant and
interesting to someone like you. Sometimes we share this kind of non-personal information
with other companies that help us deliver and improve our services. </p>

<h2>Your Information May be Shared Among Comcast Companies</h2>

<p>The Web Services are provided by various companies that are part of Comcast.
We may share your information among these Comcast companies so we can make it
easier for you to use several Web Services seamlessly. Also, if you use the Web
Services in connection with other Comcast services (for example, to set your
DVR online to record a show on your television), we may need to share your
information with the Comcast companies that offer those services, too. </p>

<h2>Disclosure of your Information </h2>

<p>We respect and protect your privacy, but it is possible that we may be
required to provide information about you to a court or law enforcement agency.
We will only disclose your information if we are legally required to do so-- if
we receive a valid subpoena, court order, or search warrant, for example.</p>

<h2>Your Choices</h2>

<p>We want you to know how you can control the personal information that we may
collect. When you use the Websites and Services that post the Privacy Policy,
you are agreeing that the policy applies to you. </p>

<h2>Registering</h2>

<p>You may choose not to register for any one of the Web Services (or for all
of them) if you do not want to share information that identifies you when you
use that Website. </p>

<p>If you do register, we will give you a chance to create a profile. We may
use some of the information in that profile to choose the content and
advertising we think you would like to see. </p>

<p>When you register, we may also send you email about other products and
services. You may choose not to receive these messages. However, we will still
send you email with information about the specific services you use. </p>

<h2>Plaxo and Tunerfish</h2>

<p>Plaxo users have several choices about how to share information from their
address books and calendars. Tunerfish users have several choices about how to
share information about themselves and the television shows they watch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Privacy Policy explains how you can make
those choices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<h2>Advertising Networks</h2>

<p>Advertising networks help us display ads to you. They may use cookies and
other technology to identify your interests so they can give you more useful ads.
In the Privacy Policy, we give you the links to the "opt-out" pages for the ad
networks that we use. You can elect to tell them not to collect information
from you. </p>

<h2>Blogs and Forums</h2>

<p>If you choose to post information on blogs or forums on the Websites, it
will not be private. Once the information is posted, other users may copy or
store it. </p>

<h2>Transferring Information to Social Networking Sites and Services</h2>

<p>You may choose to use social networking Websites to share information from
your Comcast profile, or information about what you do when you use the Comcast
Web Services. If we get instructions to send your information to one of these
Websites, with your valid Comcast login information included, we will accept
the instructions to transfer your information. </p>

</div>

<h1>Changes to Comcast's Business or the Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>If Comcast's business changes - for example, if our company merges with
another company or we sell one or more of the Comcast companies that provide
the Web Services - we may give the new owners of the Web Services your
information. If this happens, we will tell you. We will also let you know if
the Privacy Policy changes for any other reason, so you can decide whether you
want to continue using the Web Services. </p>

<h1><a name="full">Full Policy</a></h1>

<p class="heading1numbered">1. About the Privacy Policy and the Comcast Web
Services</p>

<p>The Comcast family of companies respects your privacy. Within this Web
Services Privacy Policy ("<b>Privacy Policy</b>") the term "<b>Comcast</b>" or
"<b>we</b>" will refer to Comcast Cable Communications Management, LLC, Comcast
Interactive Media, LLC, and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates that
own and operate Websites and Internet services on their behalf. The term "<b>you</b>"
refers to you as a user of Comcast's Websites or Internet services described
below. The term "<b>Personally Identifiable Information</b>" or "<b>PII</b>"
refers to information that identifies a specific person, such as the person's
name, address, social security number, financial account number, or phone
number. The term "<b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b>" or "<b>non-PII</b>"
refers to information that is demographic, aggregated, or does not otherwise identify
a specific person, such as a person's age, gender, ZIP code, or other
information when that information is not used with Personally Identifiable
Information.</p>

<div>

<h2>What does this Privacy Policy cover? </h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Comcast will use the information that you
provide when you use these Comcast-owned and operated Websites and services:</p>

<ol start="1" type="1">
 <li class="" style="line-height: 115%;">the Websites
     www.comcast.net, customer.comcast.com, 
     <a href="http://www.tunerfish.com/">www.tunerfish.com</a>,
     and www.plaxo.com (the "<b>Comcast Sites</b>"); </li>
 <li class="" style="line-height: 115%;">all software
     and services provided by Plaxo, including those services made available
     through its application programming interfaces ("<b>APIs</b>")(collectively
     the "<b>Plaxo</b> <b>Service</b>"); and</li>
 <li class="" style="line-height: 115%;">all other
     software and services provided by Tunerfish, including those services made
     available by Tunerfish through its APIs( collectively the "<b style="">Tunerfish Service</b>", and collectively,
     (1), (2), and (3) the "<b>Comcast Web Services</b>"). </li>
</ol>

<h2>What is outside the scope of this Privacy Policy? </h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy <b><i>does not apply</i></b> to your use of any other
products or services provided by Comcast such as Comcast Digital Cable with On
Demand, Comcast Digital Voice, Comcast High Speed Internet, XFINITY TV, XFINITY
Voice, or XFINITY Internet. If you subscribe to or use one or more of these
services, you can see the privacy policy that applies to the residential
versions of these services by visiting <a href="http://www.comcast.com/customerprivacy/">http://www.comcast.com/customerprivacy/</a>.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy also <b><i>does not apply</i></b> to Comcast's use of
information provided by you when you sign up for or use the XFINITY TV Store
(xfinitytvstore.comcast.net). Comcast's use of the information you provide through the
XFINITY TV Store is described in the XFINITY TV Store Privacy Policy, available at <a href="http://xfinitytvstore.comcast.net/PrivacyPolicy.aspx">http://xfinitytvstore.comcast.net/PrivacyPolicy.aspx</a>.

</p><p>Some of the Comcast Web Services contain links to other Websites, including
Websites of third parties who are acting on our behalf as our agents,
suppliers, or providers. These other Websites are not operated by Comcast and
have their own privacy policies that we encourage you to read before you use
them. Other sites that we link to may contain Comcast branding, but these
non-Comcast Websites and resources are provided by companies or persons other
than Comcast. Examples of these non-Comcast Websites include Websites where you
are required to log-in using a username and password other than your username
and password for the Comcast Web Services, such as the Jobs channel and the
Dating channel on Comcast.net. This Privacy Policy <b><i>does not apply</i></b>
to those non-Comcast sites. Those sites will have their own policies that we
encourage you to read before you use them. </p>

<p class="heading1numbered">2. Comcast is a Member of TRUSTe</p>

<p>Comcast has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this Privacy
Policy and the practices set forth in it have been reviewed by TRUSTe for
compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html">TRUSTe's

<p class="heading1numbered">3. Collection of Information </p>

<div>

<h2>All Users</h2>

<p>Comcast, or third parties acting on Comcast's behalf, routinely logs
Non-Personally Identifiable Information that is automatically generated when
all users visit or use the Comcast Sites, as a by-product of the user's
activities ("<b>Web Log Data</b>"). This information includes, but is not
limited to, Internet protocol ("<b>IP</b>") header information that is
automatically passed between a user's computer and the Comcast Sites, such as
the computer's IP address, the browser being used at the time, and the URL of
the webpage on the Comcast Sites that the browser requested. This information
may also include details relating to the activities users perform within the
Comcast Sites, such as what links they click on, in what order they access
specific web pages within the Comcast Sites, and the search queries they
perform on the Comcast Sites.</p>

<p>Some of the Comcast Web Services allow you to store certain details and
preferences that help you personalize that Comcast Service ("<b>Preference Data</b>").
This Non-Personally Identifiable Information may include ZIP code, age, gender,
favorite genre to watch on television, and preferred type of news. Comcast
stores Preference Data in a cookie that it places on your computer. We do this
so that you do not have to enter this data every time you return to the Comcast
Sites. We may also use the Preference Data to deliver other personalized
services and features of the Comcast Web Services.</p>

<h2>Registered Users</h2>

<p>Comcast asks you to provide certain information when you initially register
to use the Comcast Web Services and then afterwards may ask you to provide
additional information when you use certain Comcast Web Services for the first
time. In addition, Comcast also collects information about your use of the
Comcast Web Services as a registered user. This table summarizes the different
types of information that we may collect from you when you register for the Comcast
Web Services and use the Comcast Web Services as a registered user.</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>Collectively, your Registration Data, Profile Data, Activity Data, and any
other generally available demographic data about you that Comcast gathers from
other sources is referred to as "<b>Your Data</b>." Your Data does not include
information that third parties may independently gather from other Websites
about you using their own cookies, as further described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Most Comcast Sites have their own pages where you can manage certain
portions of your Registration Data and Profile Data relevant to that specific
Comcast Site. For your reference, those pages can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://xfinitytv.comcast.net/mytv/home">http://xfinitytv.comcast.net/mytv/home</a></p>

</div>

<p class="heading1numbered">4. Use of Information</p>

<p>Comcast uses Web Log Data, Preferences Data, and Your Data, including both
Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information
in both aggregated and individual forms, to provide the Comcast Web Services
and support them. We may process and use this data for purposes consistent with
this Privacy Policy including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li class="" style="line-height: 115%;">Customize,
     measure, and improve the Comcast Web Services, and the content and
     advertising provided through them;</li>
 <li class="" style="line-height: 115%;">Enforce our
     Web Services Terms of Service and detect fraud and other illegal
     activities;</li>
 <li class="" style="line-height: 115%;">Bill and
     collect for any applicable fees or charges;</li>
 <li class="" style="line-height: 115%;">Let you know
     about new products or services from Comcast or other companies we work
     with as well as promotional offers, based on your preference settings;</li>
 <li class="" style="line-height: 115%;">Let you know
     about changes to the Comcast Web Services, the Web Services Terms of
     Service, this Privacy Policy, and other terms that apply to our services;
     and</li>
 <li class="" style="line-height: 115%;">Update any
     programs or other tools that we provide in conjunction with the Comcast
     Web Services.</li>
</ul>

<p>Comcast may use Web Log Data, Preferences Data, and Your Data in these forms
for internal business purposes, such as determining how much traffic certain
portions of the Comcast Web Services receive, for license reporting and
assessment of service levels, to better understand how the Comcast Web Services
are used, to gauge traffic patterns and determine what types of content and
services are most popular with users of the Comcast Web Services, or
determining which search queries on certain Comcast Service are the most
popular.</p>

<p>Comcast may also use Web Log Data, Preferences Data, and Your Data to
customize the Comcast Sites and Services and make them more relevant to you.
For example, Comcast may use such data to determine which news articles,
movies, or television shows to recommend to you.</p>

<p>Comcast may use your Registration Data to verify that you are the person
authorized to use the Comcast Web Services or to manage your account. Comcast
may also use your Registration Data to determine whether your Comcast Digital
Cable with On Demand subscription allows you to access premium content or
services offered through some of the Comcast Sites. For example, Comcast may
use this subscription information to permit you to access, via one or more of
the Comcast Web Services, certain programming included in your Comcast Digital
Cable with On Demand package or to recommend additional Comcast products and
services that it thinks may be of interest to you.</p>

<p class="heading1numbered">5. Sharing of Information</p>

<p>Comcast uses third parties to assist us in delivering parts of the Comcast
Web Services to you. We may share portions of Your Data with these third
parties to the extent necessary for them to provide these services. These
companies are acting on Comcast's behalf and are required, by contract with
Comcast, to keep this information confidential and are only authorized to use
it for specific purposes. As described in more detail below, Comcast may also
provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information elements of Your Data to third
parties who deliver ads to you on Comcast's behalf. Comcast will not provide
your Personally Identifiable Information to these advertisers unless you
expressly authorize us to do so.</p>

<p>Comcast may also share Web Log Data and Preference Data, which do not
contain Personally Identifiable Information, with third parties. For example,
Comcast may share traffic data for one of the Comcast Sites with a third party
that analyzes and publishes Website traffic surveys. Or, Comcast may share Web
Log Data and Preference Data with one of the providers of movies on
xfinitytv.comcast.net, so that Comcast and the provider can determine what additional
movies that provider should show on xfinitytv.comcast.net.</p>

<p>Comcast may also share Web Log Data, Preference Data, and Your Data within
its internal family of companies solely to provide you with the Comcast Web
Services, other cross-platform services, and advertising it thinks may be of
interest to you. For example, Comcast will share your Registration Data within
its internal family of companies to provide you with online access to content
from premium networks that are part of your Comcast Digital Cable with On
Demand subscription if you have signed up for that service, and to make you
aware of other Comcast products and services it thinks may be of interest to
you. This sharing occurs when you sign up for and use these other services, and
may be necessary for us to provide them. If you do not want Your Data shared
with a specific service, then you may choose not to sign up for that service or
stop using it at any time if you have already signed up for it.</p>

<p>You may authorize other Internet sites such as MySpace or Facebook to access
and publish on their Websites some of Your Data, including your Activity Data.
For example, you may enable a Facebook widget to access and publish to your
Facebook page what shows you watch on xfinitytv.comcast.net. In addition, certain
Comcast Web Services allow you to use your contact lists from Internet sites
such as MySpace or Facebook to share portions of Your Data, including your
Activity Data, with others. For example, www.tunerfish.com may allow you to "check-in" to
on your favorite television show on xfinitytv.comcast.net, and then let all of your
Facebook friends know what you are watching. If you provide Comcast with your
credentials for this kind of Internet service and use the features of the
Comcast Service that share information across these Internet services, or, if
one of these Internet service contacts Comcast using your Comcast Web Services
credentials and asks to have access to certain portions of Your Data, Comcast
will treat this as your authorization to share such portions of Your Data with
that Internet service.</p>

<p class="heading1numbered">6. Advertisements</p>

<p>Comcast, or advertising network providers acting at Comcast's request, may
deliver advertisements to you through the Comcast Web Services, depending on
whether you are a registered user or not, as described in more detail below.</p>

<h2>All Users</h2>

<p>We, or our advertising providers, automatically deliver ads to all users of
the Comcast Sites, whether they are registered or not, based on non-personal information
including: (i) the IP address associated with your computer for purposes of
determining your approximate geographic location; (ii) the type of web page
that is being displayed, such as a news or sports page, for example; or (iii)
the content on the page that is shown, such as a sports article about a certain
team or a movie review for a particular movie. Because this advertising
activity automatically applies to all users and it is purely contextual, this
type of advertising delivery cannot be customized or controlled by individual
users.</p>

<h2>Registered Users</h2>

<p>If you are a registered user, Comcast may use Your Data, regardless of where
we gathered such information, to determine what type of ad to display to you on
the Comcast Sites. For example, Comcast may use portions of Your Data that it
gathered on xfinity.comcast.net to determine which ad to show you when you visit
xfinitytv.comcast.net. In addition, Comcast may send certain demographic information,
like ZIP code, age, and gender to its advertising network providers, so that
the advertising you see is more relevant to you. These advertising network
providers will only use such information to display an ad to you on the Comcast
Sites. </p>

<p class="heading1numbered">7. Advertising Networks and Other Service Provider
Networks </p>

<p>The advertising companies who deliver ads for us on the Comcast Sites may
use HTTP cookies and Flash cookies to uniquely distinguish your web browser and
keep track of information relating to serving ads on your web browser, such as
the type of ads shown and the web pages on which the ads appeared. In addition,
the third parties that provide Web Log services for Comcast may use cookies to
uniquely distinguish your web browser and to keep track of the Websites that
your web browser visits across the service provider's network of Websites.
These companies may combine this information with other information they have
independently collected from other Websites relating to your web browser's
activities across their network of Websites. These companies collect and use
information under their own privacy policies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For more information on controlling HTTP and Flash cookies, please visit
our "Customer Control" FAQ, <a href="http://customer.comcast.com/Pages/FaqDisplay.aspx?Guid=dfcbf43e-91b2-4444-a04d-8d7c68fcb356#custcontrol">here</a>.</p>

<p>Comcast encourages you to be aware of the privacy policies of these
companies before you choose to allow them to place a cookie for your web
browser. The list of our partners that operate their own networks can be found <a href="#partners">here.</a></p>

<p class="heading1numbered">8. Communicating with You </p>

<p>Comcast may use your Registration Data to send you a confirmation e-mail
verifying the ownership of the e-mail addresses provided in your Registration
Data and to send you service-related communications about the Comcast Web
Services. In addition, Comcast may send you promotional or commercial e-mail
relating to each Comcast Site for which you have activated your account as
permitted by applicable law. You can opt-out from receiving such promotional or
commercial e-mail by following the instructions contained in the e-mails or by going
to: </p>

<p><a href="http://xfinity.comcast.net/subscribe/">http://xfinity.comcast.net/subscribe<o:p></o:p></a></p>

from members to join Plaxo. When you register for permanent opt-out, you
provide us with a validated e-mail address at which you no longer wish to
receive Plaxo invite requests. Comcast may send you an opt-opt confirmation
e-mail to the address you enter. If you are sent an opt-out confirmation
e-mail, you must respond to that e-mail to complete the opt-out process. The
opt-out is available here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.plaxo.com/opt_out">http://www.plaxo.com/opt_out</a> </p>

<p class="heading1numbered">9. Signing in Using Non-Comcast Credentials </p>

<p>Comcast may allow you to access portions of the Comcast Web Services by
signing in using your username or other identifier from another Internet
service ("<b>Non-Comcast Username</b>"). Comcast will treat your Non-Comcast
Username and any additional data that the relevant Internet service provides to
Comcast about you as Your Data. </p>

<p class="heading1numbered">10. Participating in Blogs and Forums</p>

<p>If you post comments to any of the blogs, forums, or other editorial
sections of the Comcast Web Services, any information you submit there can be
read, collected, or used by other users of the Comcast Web Services and any PII
you post could be used to contact you. We are not responsible for PII you
choose to submit through these features.</p>

<p>Children under the age of 13 should not post in any of the blogs, forums, or
other editorial sections of the Comcast Web Services.</p>

<p class="heading1numbered">11. Security</p>

<p>Comcast uses industry standard approaches to securely store, control access
to, and make appropriate use of Your Data, and we require our contractors and
other providers to do so as well. However, no security measure is completely
effective and Comcast cannot guarantee the complete security of Your Data. If
you don't want Comcast to know any particular information about you, you should
not register to use the Comcast Web Services or include it in anything that you
submit or post to Comcast, including posts on the Comcast Sites or e-mails to
Comcast. More information on Internet security can be found here: <a href="http://security.comcast.net/">http://security.comcast.net/</a>. </p>

<p>Comcast also takes additional steps to increase the security and reliability
of customer communications. We do not read your outgoing or incoming e-mail,
file attachments, video mail, private chat, or instant messages. However, we
(along with our third party providers) use software and hardware tools to help
prevent and block "spam" e-mails, viruses, spyware, and other harmful
or unwanted communications and programs from bring sent and received over
Comcast.net e-mail and the Comcast Sites. These tools may automatically scan
your e-mails, video mails, instant messages, file attachments, and other files
and communications in order to help us protect you and the Service against
these harmful or unwanted communications and programs. You can learn more about
Comcast's anti-spam approach at <a href="http://help.comcast.net/content/faq/What-is-Comcast-doing-about-spam">http://help.comcast.net/content/faq/What-is-Comcast-doing-about-spam</a>.</p>

<p>As an additional security precaution, neither Comcast nor any of our
authorized service providers will ask you for your Comcast password in an
e-mail, over the telephone, or in an online support forum or chat area. <b>Do
not give your Comcast password to anyone in an e-mail, over the telephone, or
in an online support area</b>.</p>

<p class="heading1numbered">12. Disclosures of Information</p>

<p>Comcast holds customer privacy in the highest regard and we make every
reasonable effort to protect your privacy as described in this Privacy Policy.
Nevertheless, we may be required by law to disclose Personally Identifiable
Information or other information about you or other users of the Comcast Web
Services. These disclosures may be made with or without your consent, and with
or without notice, in compliance with the terms of a subpoena, court order,
search warrant, or other valid legal process. We may also disclose information
about you or users of the Comcast Web Services when we believe in good faith
that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent financial loss,
address suspected illegal activity, protect our rights or property, or prevent
imminent physical harm.</p>

<p class="heading1numbered">13. Special Note About Children</p>

<p>Comcast does not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from
anyone under the age of 13 without first obtaining parental consent. For those
portions of the Comcast Web Services that do collect information from children
under the age of 13 after obtaining parental consent, Comcast or its
contractors will provide a special notice or other information describing any
additional privacy protections that may apply. Children should always get
permission from a parent or legal guardian before sending any information about
themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers) over the
Internet, to Comcast or to anyone else. </p>

<p class="heading1numbered">14. Your California Privacy Rights</p>

<p>California law permits its residents to request and receive information
about a business' disclosure of certain categories of PII to other companies
for their use for direct marketing. If you are a California resident and a user
of any of the Comcast Web Services, you can request a copy of this information
from Comcast Interactive Media, LLC by sending e-mail to CIM_Privacy at Comcast
dot com or a letter to Comcast Interactive Media, LLC, Attn: California Direct
Marketing Information, One Comcast Center, Philadelphia, PA 19103. Please
include your name and e-mail address in e-mail requests, and your name and
postal address in mail requests.</p>

<p class="heading1numbered">15. Change of Ownership or Other Business Transaction</p>

<p>In the event Comcast enters into a business transition, such as a merger,
acquisition, or the sale of all or part of its assets (a "<b>Business
Transition</b>"), Your Data (including PII and non-PII associated with the
Comcast Web Services) will likely be part of the assets transferred. </p>

<p>In this event, we will notify you of any Business Transition. We will also
notify you of any subsequent material changes to this Privacy Policy as a
result of a Business Transaction and give you the opportunity to opt-out for
information that we have collected before, or may collect after, a new Privacy
Policy containing material changes takes effect.</p>

<p class="heading1numbered">16. Plaxo</p>

<p>The following terms in this section apply only to your use of the Plaxo
Service and www.plaxo.com (collectively the "<b>Plaxo Offerings</b>"). </p>

<p>Plaxo is a participant in the Safe Harbor program developed by the U.S.
Department of Commerce and the European Union. Plaxo has certified that it
adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles agreed upon by the U.S. and the E.U.
For more information about the Safe Harbor and to view our certification, visit
the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Website. </p>

<p>Comcast uses Your Data to enable you to use the Plaxo Offerings as follows. </p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li class="" style="line-height: 115%;">Registration
     Data and Profile Data. The name you put in your Registration Data and the
     photo (if you have uploaded one) in your Profile Data will be displayed to
     members; and to non-members who use the Plaxo Service if you choose to
     make the data publicly accessible. This is primarily so your friends,
     family or business colleagues can find you and connect with you. All users
     can control whether or not their names are listed in the Plaxo people
     search listings. You also control how all other information in your
     Registration Data and Profile Data is shared with others through your
     Plaxo privacy settings (for example, friends, family, business) located at
     <a href="http://www.plaxo.com/settings/account">http://www.plaxo.com/settings/account</a>.
     You control whether or not you have a public profile. If you have a public
     profile you choose which information from your Registration Data and
     Profile Data is part of your public profile. Public profiles are viewable
     by any member or non-member who uses the Plaxo Service. </li>
 <li class="" style="line-height: 115%;">Activity
     Data. You control with whom your Activity Data is shared. Once you share
     data with someone, however, you cannot control what those recipients do
     with your data.</li>
</ul>

<p>A special note about the contacts stored in your Plaxo address book and Plaxo's Personal Assistant: </p>

<p>Plaxo provides its members with updated contact information for the people they already have in their address books.  Plaxo uses publicly available contact information corresponding to the contacts in a Plaxo member's address book, and suggests updates for that contact information to the Plaxo member.  To help Plaxo determine whether a piece of publicly available contact information is accurate, Plaxo looks at how frequently that public information appears in the aggregation of all address book data stored in the Plaxo system.  Plaxo members who do not want their address book data used in this aggregation process can easily remove their address book data from the Plaxo Offerings. Before removing the data, Plaxo members can export it to another online address book provider. Learn more about <a href="http://help.plaxo.com/article.asp?article=1490&amp;p=16">exporting your address book</a> and <a href="http://help.plaxo.com/article.asp?article=1218&amp;p=16">deleting your account</a>.</p>

<p>Anyone, whether a Plaxo member or not, can prevent Plaxo from suggesting updates to their contact info as it appears in a Plaxo member's address book by <a href="http://www.plaxo.com/optOut">opting out</a>.</p>

<p class="heading1numbered">17. Tunerfish</p>

<p>The following terms in this section apply only to your use of the Tunerfish Service
and www.tunerfish.com (collectively the "<b>Tunerfish Offerings</b>").</p>

<p>Comcast uses Your Data to enable you to use the Tunerfish Offerings as follows.</p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li class="" style="line-height: 115%;">Registration
     Data and Profile Data. Some of
     your Registration Data and Profile Data, for example your name, bio, and
     photo, is publicly available through the Tunerfish Offerings. You can control the contents of these
     fields, but any content you put in these fields will be viewable by anyone
     who visits the Tunerfish Website or uses the Tunerfish Offerings.</li>
 <span style=""></span><span style=""></span>
 <li class="" style="line-height: 115%;"><span style=""><span style="">Activity
     Data. By default, your Activity Data is viewable by anyone who visits the
     Tunerfish Website or uses the Tunerfish Offerings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You may make your Activity Data more
     private by changing your Tunerfish privacy settings at </span></span><a href="http://www.tunerfish.com/settings"><span style=""><span style="">http://www.tunerfish.com/settings</span></span><span style=""><span style=""></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once you share your Activity Data with
     someone, you cannot control what that person does with your data.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You may choose to share your Activity
     Data with third parties (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) ("<b style="">Third Party Sites</b>").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
     you choose to share your Activity Data with any Third Party Sites, they may
     use that data as described in their own privacy policies and other
     applicable terms and conditions.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="heading1numbered">18. Changes to this Privacy Policy</p>

<p>Comcast reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time
consistent with applicable privacy laws. When we do change it, we will make a
copy of the updated Privacy Policy available to you before it takes effect. If
we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will also notify you by
e-mail, direct mail, or other reasonable methods that we select. In the event
of material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will give you the opportunity to
opt-out for information that we have collected before, or may collect after, a
new Privacy Policy containing material changes takes effect.</p>

<p>You understand and agree that if you use the Comcast Web Services after the
effective date of the updated Privacy Policy, Comcast will consider your use as
acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>

<p class="heading1numbered">19. International Visitors </p>

<p>Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your PII
will be processed by us in the United States, where data protection and privacy
regulations may be different than other parts of the world, such as the
European Union. If you create an online account to use the Comcast Sites as a
visitor from outside the United States, you will have agreed to the terms of
the Privacy Policy and our Web Services Terms of Service and you will have
consented to the transfer to and processing of all such information in the
United States, which many not offer an equivalent level of protection of that
in the European Union or certain other countries. </p>

<p class="heading1numbered">20. Contacting Comcast &amp; Customer Support</p>

<p>You can direct questions regarding this Privacy Policy to Comcast by
e-mailing us at CIM_privacy at Comcast dot com. You can also send a letter by
mail to Comcast Interactive Media, LLC, Attn: Privacy Policy Questions, One
Comcast Center, Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA. </p>

<p>You can find customer support and help information at <a href="http://customer.comcast.com/Pages/Help.aspx">http://customer.comcast.com/Pages/Help.aspx</a>.
Some online support areas and tools may ask you to provide information to
Comcast to help us address your questions or problems. We may also make
software tools available to help configure your computer's or network's
settings, or collect information from your computer or network to help us
provide support to you. If you choose to provide this information to Comcast or
use these tools, we will use the information only for customer support purposes.</p>
