We will not share this information with an advertiser, and we will not share it with another Website or company, unless you tell us to (for example, if you want to post information from your Plaxo page on your Facebook page).</p>  <p>We also use this kind of identifying information to provide services to you. For example, we may use it to bill you for services, to check your credit, to confirm your identity when you login, or to communicate with you. Sometimes we use other companies to help us provide our services. We may share your information with these companies, but they are required to protect it and to use it only to provide services to you.</p>  <h2>Information that Does Not Identify a Specific Person</h2>  <p>Information that <i>does not</i> identify a person could be a non-personal record of online activity, or information you put in a profile - like your zip code, your age or your gender (when it's used without your name). We routinely collect this kind of information and use it to improve your experience, for example, by showing you content and advertising that may be more relevant and interesting to someone like you. Sometimes we share this kind of non-personal information with other companies that help us deliver and improve our services.</p>  <h2>Your Information May be Shared Among Comcast Companies</h2>  <p>The Web Services are provided by various companies that are part of Comcast. We may share your information among these Comcast companies so we can make it easier for you to use several Web Services seamlessly. Also, if you use the Web Services in connection with other Comcast services (for example, to set your DVR online to record a show on your television), we may need to share your information with the Comcast companies that offer those services, too.</p>  <h2>Disclosure of your Information </h2>  <p>We respect and protect your privacy, but it is possible that we may be required to provide information about you to a court or law enforcement agency. We will only disclose your information if we are legally required to do soâif we receive a valid subpoena, court order, or search warrant, for example.</p>  <h2>Your Choices</h2>  <p>We want you to know how you can control the personal information that we may collect. <a href="#full">Read the full Privacy Policy</a> to find out all of your choices. When you use the Websites and Services that post the Privacy Policy, you are agreeing that the policy applies to you.</p>  <h2>Registering</h2>  <p>You may choose not to register for any one of the Web Services (or for all of them) if you do not want to share information that identifies you when you use that Website.</p>  <p>If you do register, we will give you a chance to create a profile. We may use some of the information in that profile to choose the content and advertising we think you would like to see.</p>  <p>When you register, we may also send you email about other products and services. You may choose not to receive these messages. However, we will still send you email with information about the specific services you use.</p>  <h2>Plaxo and Tunerfish</h2>  <p>Plaxo users have several choices about how to share information from their address books and calendars. Tunerfish users have several choices about how to share information about themselves and the television shows they watch.  The <a href="#full">full</a> Privacy Policy explains how you can make those choices.</p>  <h2>Third-Party Advertising</h2>  <p>We use advertising networks to help us display ads to you. In addition, our content providers may have the right to sell ads in the content they distribute through the Comcast Web Services.  All of these parties may use cookies and other technology to help them understand how you interact with their services so they can deliver you ads that are more useful to you. In the Privacy Policy, we give you more information about these parties' privacy practices and the functionality these parties make available to you to control certain of those practices. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out using the links provided <a href="#sec7">here</a>.</p>  <p>Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic advertisements.</p>  <h2>Blogs and Forums</h2>  <p>If you choose to post information on blogs or forums on the Websites, it will not be private. Once the information is posted, other users may copy or store it.</p>  <h2>Information Sharing with Social Networking Sites</h2>  <p>You may choose to exchange information between the Comcast Web Services and a social network, such as information from your Comcast profile, information about what you do on Comcast Web Services, or information about the people, places, and things that you follow on your social network. If we get instructions to send your information to, or collect your information from, one of these networks, we will follow those instructions. On pages of the Comcast Site (as defined below) that contain social network functionality, the social network providing the functionality may be able to collect information about you regardless of whether you use that functionality.  For example, if a page within the Comcast Site contains a Facebook "Like" button, Facebook may be able to collect data about your visit to that page, even if you don't click on the "Like" button.  Please review the privacy policy of the relevant social network and/or log out of it before you use the Comcast Web Services. As with other Websites, you may be able delete any cookies placed on your device by the social network using your browser.</p></div><h1>Changes to Comcast's Business or the Privacy Policy</h1><p>If Comcast's business changesâfor example, if our company merges with another company or we sell one or more of the Comcast companies that provide the Web Servicesâwe may give the new owners of the Web Services your information. If there is a change of ownership, we will tell you using any means permitted by law, including via e-mail and/or a prominent notice on the Comcast Sites, as well as let you know of any choices you may have regarding your personal information. We will also let you know if the Privacy Policy changes for any other reason, so you can decide whether you want to continue using the Web Services.</p><a name="full"> </a><h1>Full Policy</h1><p class="Heading1numbered">1.

Collection of Information </p><div class="subsection">  <h2>All Users</h2><p>Comcast, or third parties acting on Comcast's behalf, routinely logs Non-Personally Identifiable Information that is automatically generated when all users visit or use the Comcast Web Services (including both the Comcast Sites and Comcast Apps), as a by-product of the user's activities ("<b>Web Log Data</b>"). This information includes, but is not limited to, Internet protocol ("<b>IP</b>") and HTTP header information that is automatically passed between a user's device and the Comcast Web Services, such as the device's IP address, the browser being used at the time, the operating system being used at the time, the UDID of the device (if the device being used to access the Comcast Web Services is a mobile device) and the URL of the webpage or other asset within the Comcast Web Services that is being requested. This information may also include details relating to the activities users perform within the Comcast Web Services, such as what links they click on, in what order they access specific web pages within the Comcast Web Services, and the search queries they perform on the Comcast Services.</p><p>Some of the Comcast Web Services allow you to store certain details and preferences that help you personalize that Comcast Service ("<b>Preference Data</b>"). This Non-Personally Identifiable Information may include ZIP code, age, gender, favorite genre to watch on television, and preferred type of news. We do this so that you do not have to enter this data every time you return to the Comcast Web Services. We may also use the Preference Data to deliver other personalized services and features of the Comcast Web Services.</p>  <h2>Registered Users</h2>  <p>Comcast asks you to provide certain information when you initially register to use the Comcast Web Services and then afterwards may ask you to provide additional information when you use certain Comcast Web Services for the first time. In addition, Comcast also collects information about your use of the Comcast Web Services as a registered user. This table summarizes the different types of information that we may collect from you when you register for the Comcast Web Services and use the Comcast Web Services as a registered user.</p>  <table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="">  <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%"> <p>Type/Name </p> </td>  <td valign="top" width="35%"> <p>When Collected</p> </td>  <td valign="top" width="55%"> <p>Representative Examples</p> </td> </tr>  <tr> <td valign="top"> <p>Registration Data</p> </td> <td valign="top">  <p>When you create an account for the Comcast Web Services or subsequently modify your Registration Data</p> </td>  <td valign="top"> <p>First and last name, username, password, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, and gender</p> </td> </tr>  <tr> <td valign="top"> <p>Profile Data</p> </td> <td valign="top">  <p>The first time you access certain Comcast Web Services after you have created an account or subsequently modify your Profile Data</p> </td>  <td valign="top"><p>Additional e-mail addresses, lists of people to connect with through certain Comcast Web Services, school affiliations, movie genre preferences, and notification preferences for products and services made available by Comcast</p> </td> </tr>  <tr> <td valign="top"> <p>Activity Data</p> </td>  <td valign="top"> <p>When you log-in to your account and use the Comcast Web Services</p> </td>  <td valign="top"> <p>Flagging or rating news articles, movies, television shows or other content, posting blog entries or comments, sharing URLs, and content and data feeds from non-Comcast social networks or services that you choose</p> </td> </tr>  </tbody></table>  <p>Collectively, your Registration Data, Profile Data, Activity Data, and any other generally available demographic data about you that Comcast gathers from other sources is referred to as "<b>Your Data</b>." Your Data does not include information that third parties may independently gather from other Websites about you using their own cookies, as further described in this Privacy Policy.</p>  <p>Most Comcast Sites have their own pages where you can manage certain portions of your Registration Data and Profile Data relevant to that specific Comcast Site. For your reference, those pages can be found here:</p>  <p><a href="http://xfinitytv.comcast.net/mytv/settings" rel="default">http://xfinitytv.comcast.net/mytv/settings</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.plaxo.com/settings/account" rel="default">http://www.plaxo.com/settings/account</a></p></div><p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about the Comcast Sites, we will ask you for your friend's name and e-mail address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time e-mail inviting him or her to visit the Comcast Site.  We do not store this information and use it for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail and tracking the success of our referral program.</p><p>If your personal information changes, you may update it (or correct it if it is incorrect) <a href="#sec20">by contacting us</a>.  If you'd like us to help you remove any of your personal information that we have previously collected through the Comcast Sites or that is currently posted on the Comcast Sites in a public forum, directory, or testimonial, <a href="#sec20">please contact us</a>.  We will respond to your request within 30 days.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p><p>We will retain Your Data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Comcast Web Services, or as otherwise necessary to help us improve our products and services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements with you.</p><h2>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Comcast's Data Collection</h2><p>A cookie is a small file that is stored on a user's computer.  Among other things, cookies enable the Comcast Web Services to store Preferences Data, as further described in this Privacy Policy.  For example, cookies enable Xfinity.com to remember your preferred ZIP code for weather forecasts and also enable XfinityTV.com to remember where you stopped watching a movie, so the next time you use XfinityTV.com you have the option to resume watching that movie where you left off.  Cookies can also hold information like an anonymous but unique string of numbers and letters, that Comcast may use to help it collect Activity Data, as further described in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>The Comcast Web Services may use different types of cookies, like HTTP cookies (sometimes referred to as "browser cookies") and Flash cookies (sometimes referred to as "Flash LSOs").  For more information on controlling HTTP cookies and Flash cookies, please see <a href="#sec8">Section 8, below</a>.</p><p>We may also use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to help us collect Activity Data, as further described in this Privacy Policy. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to HTTP cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. If you are a registered user of the Comcast Web Services, we may associate the data we collect using cookies and/or clear gifs with your personal information and use it as further described in this Privacy Policy. If your web browser is configured not to accept cookies, you may still use the Comcast Web Services, but your ability to use some areas or functionality may be limited.</p><p class="Heading1numbered">4. Use of Information</p><p>Comcast uses Web Log Data, Preferences Data, and Your Data, including both Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information in both aggregated and individual forms, to provide the Comcast Web Services and support them. We may process and use this data for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy including, but not limited to:</p><ul class="disc"><li>Customize, measure, and improve the Comcast Web Services, and the content and advertising provided through them;</li><li>Enforce our Web Services Terms of Service and detect fraud and other illegal activities;</li><li>Bill and collect for any applicable fees or charges;</li><li>Let you know about new products or services from Comcast or other companies we work with as well as promotional offers, based on your preference settings;</li><li>Let you know about changes to the Comcast Web Services, the Web Services Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy, and other terms that apply to our services; and</li><li>Update any programs or other tools that we provide in conjunction with the Comcast Web Services.</li></ul><p>Comcast may use Web Log Data, Preferences Data, and Your Data in these forms for internal business purposes, such as determining how much traffic certain portions of the Comcast Web Services receive, for license reporting and assessment of service levels, to better understand how the Comcast Web Services are used, to gauge traffic patterns and determine what types of content and services are most popular with users of the Comcast Web Services, or determining which search queries on certain Comcast Service are the most popular.</p><p>Comcast may also use Web Log Data, Preferences Data, and Your Data to customize the Comcast Web Services and make them more relevant to you. For example, Comcast may use such data to determine which news articles, movies, or television shows to recommend to you.</p><p>Comcast may use your Registration Data to verify that you are the person authorized to use the Comcast Web Services or to manage your account. Comcast may also use your Registration Data to determine whether your XFINITY TV subscription allows you to access premium content or services offered through some of the Comcast Web Services. For example, Comcast may use this subscription information to permit you to access, via one or more of the Comcast Web Services, certain programming included in your XFINITY TV package or to recommend additional Comcast products and services that it thinks may be of interest to you.</p><p class="Heading1numbered">5.   Sharing of Information</p><p>Comcast uses third parties to assist us in delivering parts of the Comcast Web Services to you. We may share portions of Your Data with these third parties to the extent necessary for them to provide these services. These companies are acting on Comcast's behalf and are required, by contract with Comcast, to keep this information confidential and are only authorized to use it for specific purposes. As described in more detail below, Comcast may also provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information elements of Your Data to third parties who deliver ads to you on Comcast's behalf. Comcast will not provide your Personally Identifiable Information to these advertisers unless you expressly authorize us to do so.</p><p>Comcast may also share Web Log Data and Preference Data, which do not contain Personally Identifiable Information, with third parties. For example, Comcast may share traffic data for one of the Comcast Sites with a third party that analyzes and publishes Website traffic surveys. Or, Comcast may share Web Log Data and Preference Data with one of the providers of movies on XfinityTV.com, so that Comcast and the provider can determine what additional movies that provider should show on XfinityTV.com.</p><p>Comcast may also share Web Log Data, Preference Data, and Your Data within its internal family of companies solely to provide you with the Comcast Web Services, other cross-platform services, and advertising it thinks may be of interest to you. For example, Comcast will share your Registration Data within its internal family of companies to provide you with online access to content from premium networks that are part of your XFINITY TV subscription if you have signed up for that service, and to make you aware of other Comcast products and services it thinks may be of interest to you. This sharing occurs when you sign up for and use these other services, and may be necessary for us to provide them. If you do not want Your Data shared with a specific service, then you may choose not to sign up for that service or stop using it at any time if you have already signed up for it.</p><p>You may authorize other Websites such as Facebook to access and publish on their Websites some of Your Data, including your Activity Data. For example, you may enable a Facebook widget to access and publish to your Facebook page what shows you watch on XfinityTV.com. In addition, certain Comcast Web Services allow you to import information from Websites such as Facebook to use within the Comcast Web Services. For example, XfinityTV.com may enable you to use the television shows that you "Like" on Facebook to create your "Favorites" on XfinityTV.com.  If you provide Comcast with your credentials for this kind of Internet service and use the features of the Comcast Service that share information across these Internet services, or, if one of these Internet service contacts Comcast using your Comcast Web Services credentials and asks to have access to certain portions of Your Data, Comcast will treat this as your authorization to share such portions of Your Data with that Internet service.</p><p>On pages of the Comcast Site that contain social network functionality, the social network providing the functionality may be able to collect information about you, even if you don't use that functionality.  For example, if a page within the Comcast Site contains a Facebook "Like" button, Facebook may be able to collect data about your visit to that page, even if you don't click on the "Like" button.
