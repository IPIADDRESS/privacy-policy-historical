    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi there!</p>

    <p>We prepared this Privacy Policy and <a target="_blank" href="/CookiesPolicy">Cookie Policy</a> (which is incorporated herein) to explain to you how and why we collect Personal Information about you when you are using our Platform.</p>

    <p>The Privacy Policy and <a target="_blank" href="/CookiesPolicy">Cookie Policy</a> are a part of the <a target="_blank" href="/TermsOfUse">Terms</a> and are incorporated therein by references. The definitions which appear in this document shall have the meaning ascribed to them in our <a target="_blank" href="/TermsOfUse">Terms</a>.</p>

    <p>When you use the Platform, you consent to the collection, storage, use, disclosure and other uses of your Personal Information (meaning, any information which may potentially allow your identification with reasonable means) as described in this Privacy Policy. If we combine Personal Information with anonymous information about you, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.</p>


    <h2>How do we receive information about you?</h2>
    
    <p>We receive information (including Personal Information) about you from various sources:
        </p><ul>
            <li><p>If you voluntarily provide us your personal details within the Platform (for example by registering to create a Playjunkie Account or by subscribing to our newsletter); </p></li>
            <li><p>If you use or access our Platform (for example by visiting our Website or the Embedded Items, by contributing content to our Platform or by clicking on certain content or on advertisements); </p></li>
            <li><p>From third party websites and services (for example we may receive information from the websites, social network platforms or applications on which the Embedded Items are included). </p></li>
        </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h2>What kinds of information do we collect?</h2>
    <p>
        Depending on which features of the Platform you use, we collect different kinds of information (including Personal Information) about or from you.
        </p><ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>When you register to create a Playjunkie Account in our Platform â€“</strong><br>
                    We collect the information you provide when you sign up to our Platform. This can include your name, email address, your photograph and other information you provide. If you register to our Platform through a social network platform (for example Facebook or Google+), you will provide us access to any information you made available on that platform, (depending on your privacy settings) and any additional information that you specifically consent to provide us with.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>When you interact with content on our Platform â€“ </strong><br>
                    We collect certain information about you when you interact or engage with content made available on our Platform. This includes information about the websites and apps you visit (including the Website, the Embedded Items, the Applications and any Third Party Content), your use of the content displayed on the Platform (including your clicks on answers to questions presented and other information that you submit), your use of the advertisements displayed on the Platform (including your clicks on advertisements) as well as information the developer or publisher of the website or app provides to us.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>When you contribute User Content to our Platform â€“ </strong><br>
                    We collect the User Content that you publish or contribute to our Platform (for example comments that you have posted, or content that you have uploaded through your Playjunkie Account). If your use of our Platform includes certain financial transactions (for example, if you are an advertiser, publisher, partner or customer, with whom we have contractually engaged) we collect information about the transaction. This can include your payment information (for example your credit card number and other card information), billing, and contact details, as well as other authentication information.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Log data and device information â€“ </strong><br>
                    We automatically record and collect certain Personal Information from or about your device (for example your computer or your mobile device) when you install our Application or access our Platform (for example when you visit our Website) or when you interact with our content (including when you visit the Embedded Items). This includes information about your operating system version, IP address, GCM Registration ID, device settings, hardware information, device approximate location, mobile operator or internet service provider information, browser type, language preferences, time zone, domains that referred you to our Platform (for example the HTTP referrer and URL) and the duration of your visits, your actions on these visits (for example clicks or views on content on the domain, or interactions with social media features). We may also automatically collect your device geo-location.
                    When you are using our Application, we also automatically record your Google Advertising ID (if you are using an Android device) or your advertising Identifier (IDFA â€“ if you are using an iOS device), for advertising purposes.
                    The Google Advertising ID is an anonymous identifier, provided by Google Play services. If your device has an Advertising ID, we collect and use it for advertising and user analytics purposes. By downloading or using our Application, you explicitly agree that we may associate your Advertising ID with your applicable persistent device identifier. This will facilitate our ability to improve your personalized experience. Further, we may use other persistent identifiers for non-advertising purposes. If your device does not have Advertising ID, we will use other persistent identifiers. The information collected may be also stored on your device.
