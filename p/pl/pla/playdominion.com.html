<p>Making Fun, Inc. (“Making Fun” or “we”) is a publisher and developer of mobile and social games. The services Making Fun offers include MakingFun.com, games published on a variety of platforms, and other features, content, games or applications offered, from time to time, by or on behalf of, Making Fun, including when these services are accessed via the Internet, mobile or other device (collectively, the “Making Fun Services”).&nbsp; Making Fun is based in the United States.</p>
<p>As set forth in our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.makingfun.com/terms-of-services/" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>, the Making Fun Services are general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users.&nbsp; This Policy describes the collection and use of users’ personal information on the Making Fun Services. It also describes generally Making Fun’s practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account.</p>
<p><strong>2. SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON MAKING FUN SERVICES</strong></p>
<p><em>User Submitted Information</em></p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Account Information.&nbsp;</strong>When you access a Making Fun Service through a third-party connection or log-in, we may collect your user ID and/or user name associated with that third-party service, or any information you have submitted in connection with that service and which the third party shares with partner services.</p>
<p><strong>Email Address.&nbsp;</strong>If email address is not included in such information, Making Fun may ask you to submit your email address directly to Making Fun.</p>
<p><strong>Public Site Content</strong>&nbsp;consists of information you disclose in public areas of the Making Fun Services, such as forums, message boards, chat rooms, gameplay sessions, and other community areas. &nbsp;It also includes the information about you that accompanies this content, such as a username or user picture. &nbsp;Please be aware that Public Site Content is always public and available to everyone and may be displayed in search results both on the Making Fun Services and on external search engines. By way of example, gameplay logs containing usernames, timestamps and gameplay data may be made available over the public internet for players to download and analyze for their enjoyment. Please do not use a username that can identify you personally (for example because you use it on other sites that reveal additional information about you) if you have any concerns about this information being freely available.</p>
<p><strong>Correspondence</strong>&nbsp;consists of information you disclose when you contact Making Fun, for example, for customer service purposes.</p>
<p><em>Making Fun&nbsp;Collected Information</em></p>
<p><strong>Making Fun&nbsp;Site Activity Information.&nbsp;</strong>When users access the Making Fun Services, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits.&nbsp; For example, in order to permit your connection to the Making Fun Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.&nbsp; If you access the Making Fun Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.&nbsp; We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier.&nbsp; Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so that Making Fun can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site.&nbsp; We may use these technologies to collect and store information about your usage of the Making Fun Services, such as pages you have visited, game sessions you have played, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen.</p>
<p>Third parties that support the Making Fun Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing users to share content or tracking aggregate site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.&nbsp; Making Fun does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.&nbsp; For more information about third-party ad networks that use these technologies, see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">www.aboutads.info</a>.</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.&nbsp; Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information.&nbsp; Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website, see <a href="http://www.adobe.com/privacy/policy.html">http://www.adobe.com/privacy/policy.html</a>.&nbsp; Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through the Making Fun Services.</p>
<p><strong>Third Parties.&nbsp;</strong>To improve the quality of the Making Fun Services, we may also supplement the information we collect with information from third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Not Track.</strong>&nbsp;Do Not Track (DNT) is a&nbsp;privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals, and, therefore, Making Fun, nor it’s publishing or affiliated partners, does not recognize DNT.</p>
