<h2>Data Privacy Policy</h2>

    Our website may be used without entering personal information. Different rules may apply to certain services on our site,
    however, and are explained separately below. We collect personal information from you (e.g. name, email address) in
    accordance with the provisions of German data protection statutes. Information is considered personal if it can be

</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>

<p>
    Our website makes use of so-called cookies in order to recognize repeat use of our website by the same user/internet
    connection subscriber. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser downloads and stores on your computer.
    They are used to improve our website and services. In most cases these are so-called "session cookies" that are deleted
    once you leave our website.
</p>
<p>
    To an extent, however, these cookies also pass along information used to automatically recognize you.
    Recognition occurs through a code  saved to the cookies. The information thereby obtained is used to improve our
    services and to expedite your access to the website.
</p>
<p>
    You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly.
    You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website.
</p>

<h4>Server Data</h4>

<p>
    For technical reasons, data such as the following, which your internet browser transmits to us or to our web
    space provider (so called server log files), is collected:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>- type and version of the browser you use</li>
    <li>- operating system</li>
    <li>- websites that linked you to our site (referrer URL)</li>
    <li>- websites that you visit</li>
    <li>- date and time of your visit</li>
    <li>- your Internet Protocol (IP) address.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This anonymous data is stored separately from any personal information you may have provided, thereby making it
    impossible to connect it to any particular person. The data is used for statistical purposes in order to improve our
    website and services.
</p>

<h4>Purpose of Registering</h4>

<p>
    We offer you the opportunity to sign up for our website. The information entered when signing up, as shown in the registration form
    (<strong>name, username, e-mail address</strong>) is collected and stored solely for use by our website. When signing up for
    our website, we also store your IP address and the date and time you registered. This serves to protect us in the
    event a third party improperly and without your knowledge makes use of your data to sign up for our site. None of
    this information is transferred to third parties. Nor is any of this information matched to any information that may
    be collected by other components of our website.
</p>

<h4>Contacting Us</h4>

<p>
    On our website we offer you the opportunity to contact us, either by email and/or by using a contact form.
    In such event, information provided by the user is stored for the purpose of facilitating communications with the user.
    No data is transferred to third parties. Nor is any of this information matched to any information that may be
    collected by other components of our website.
</p>

<h4>Use of Google Analytics with anonymization</h4>

<p>
    Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA,
    hereinafter referred to as “Google“. Google Analytics employs so-called “cookies“, text files that are stored to your
    computer in order to facilitate an analysis of your use of the site.
    The information generated by these cookies, such as time, place and frequency of your visits to our site, including
    your IP address, is transmitted to Google’s location in the US and stored there.
    In using Google Analytics our website employs the extension, "_gat._anonymizeIp". In doing so, Google abbreviates
    and thereby anonymizes your IP address before transferring it from member states of the European Union or signatory
    states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
    Google uses this information to analyze your use of our site, to compile reports for us on internet activity and to
    provide other services relating to website and internet use. Google may also transfer this information to third parties
    where required to do so by law or where such third parties process this data on Google’s behalf.
    Google states that it will in never associate your IP address with other data held by Google. You can prevent
    cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly. You should be aware,
    however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website.
    Furthermore, Google offers a deactivation add-on for most current browsers that provides you with more control over
    what data Google can collect on websites you access. The add-on tells the JavaScript (ga.js) used by Google Analytics
    not to transmit any information about website visits to Google Analytics. However, the browser deactivation add-on
    offered by Google Analytics does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analysis services
    we may engage. You can find additional information on how to install the browser add-on at the following link:
    <br>
    <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="blue">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a>
</p>

<h4>Use of the web analysis service PIWIK</h4>

<p>
    Our website uses the web analysis service PIWIK. To carry out this analysis, PIWIK uses cookies. Cookies are small
    text files that are stored to your computer and provide analysis of your use of the site.
    The information generated by these cookies, such as time, place and frequency of your visits to our site, including
    your IP address, are transmitted to our PIWIK server and stored there. As part of this process, you IP address is
    immediately anonymized so that you as user remain anonymous to us. The information generated by the cookie about
    your use of this site is not transferred to third parties. You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting
    the settings on your browser software accordingly. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be
    able to make full use of all the functions of our website.
</p>

<p>
    Should you be unwilling to have this data about your use of the site stored and analyzed, you may at any time
    subsequently withdraw your consent to it being stored and used with a click of the mouse. A so-called opt-out cookie
    is then placed on your browser, and as a result Piwik will no longer collect any data on your visits. Please be aware that,
    should you delete cookies from your browser settings, the opt-out cookie from PIWIK may also be deleted and will need
    to be reactivated.

<h4>Use of Google+ recommendation components</h4>

<p>
    Our website employs the “+1“-buttom from Google+ belonging to Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA,
    hereinafter referred to as “Google“.
    Each time our website receives an access request equipped with a “+1“ component, the component prompts your browser
    to download an image of this component from Google. Through this process, Google is informed precisely which page of
    our website is being visited.
    As specified by Google, your visit undergoes additional analysis in the event you are not logged into your Google account.
    If you access our site while logged into Google and press the “+1" button, Google can collect information about your
    Google account, websites you recommend as well as your IP address, along with other browser-related information.
    This allows your “+1“ recommendation to be stored and publicized. Your Google “+1“ recommendation can then appear as
    a reference in other Google services, such as search results, your Google account or other places, such as on websites
    and ads in the internet, together with your account name and, if applicable, a picture you provided to Google.
    Furthermore, Google can link your visit to our site with data stored by Google. Google also records this information
    for the purpose of further improving Google services.
    If you wish to minimize the collection of information by Google as previously described, you must log out of your
    Google account before visiting our website.
</p>

<p>
    You can access Google‘s data protection policies relating to the “+1“ button together with all relevant information
    on the collection, transfer and use of data by Google, your rights in this regard as well as your profile settings
    options at the following link:

</p>

<h4>Use of Facebook components</h4>

<p>
    Our website employs components provided by facebook.com. Facebook is a service of Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.
</p>
<p>
    Each time our website receives an access request equipped with a Facebook component, the component prompts your browser
    to download an image of this Facebook component. Through this process, Facebook is informed precisely which page of
    our website is being visited.
</p>
<p>
    When you access our site while logged into Facebook, Facebook uses information gathered by this component to identify
    the precise page you are viewing and associates this information to your personal account on Facebook. Whenever you
    click on the “Like“ button, for example, or enter a comment, this information is transmitted to your personal account
    on Facebook and stored there. In addition, Facebook is informed of your visit to our website. This occurs regardless
    of whether you click on a component or not.
</p>
<p>
    If you wish to prevent the transfer to and storage of data by Facebook about you and your interaction with our website,
    you must first log out of Facebook before visiting our website. The data protection policies of Facebook provide
    additional information, in particular about the collection and use of data by Facebook, your rights in this regard
    as well as the options available to you for protecting your privacy:
    <br>
    <a href="https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="blue">https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>
</p>

<p>
    In addition, tools are freely available on the market that can be used to block Facebook social plug-ins with add-ons
    from being added to all commonly used browsers:
    <br>
    <a href="http://webgraph.com/resources/facebookblocker/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="blue">http://webgraph.com/resources/facebookblocker/</a>

</p>

<h4>Use of Google AdSense </h4>

<p>
    Our website employs Google AdSense. Google AdSense is a service of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain
    View, CA 94043 USA, for incorporating advertisements. Google-AdSense uses so-called “cookies“, text files, that are
    stored to your computer and which provide analysis of the use of our website. Furthermore, Google AdSense uses
    so-called “web beacons“. Web beacons allow Google to analyze information, such as visitor traffic to our website.
    This information, along with your IP address and the ad format displayed, is transmitted to Google in the US where
    it is stored and may be transferred by Google to contracting partners. However, Google does not merge your IP-address
    with other stored data on you. You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser
    software accordingly. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the
    functions of our website. By using our website you declare that you agree to the processing of data collected about
    you by Google in the manner previously described and for the purposes there specified.
</p>

<h4>Information/Cancellation/Deletion</h4>

<p>
    On the basis of the Federal Data Protection Act, you may contact us at no cost if you have questions relating to the
    collection, processing or use of your personal information, if you wish to request the correction, blocking or
    deletion of the same, or if you wish to cancel explicitly granted consent. Please note that you have the right to
    have incorrect data corrected or to have personal data deleted, where such claim is not barred by any legal
    obligation to retain this data.
