<h4>
Children's Guidelines
</h4>

<p>

	    We care about children and understand that they have
            special privacy needs.  Therefore, we have adopted the following
            privacy policy regarding children:
	  
</p><ol>
<li>
We will NOT collect, use, or distribute to third 
  parties personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental 
  consent. 
  
</li><li>
We will NOT give the child access to unmonitored chat 
  rooms, message boards, email accounts, or other services that would give the 
  child the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally 
  identifiable information without prior verifiable parental consent 
  
</li><li>
When verifiable parental consent is not obtained, we
             will only use the online contact information (such as email) to:
  	    
<ol type="a">
<li>
Respond directly to the child's request on a 
    one-time basis and not use that information to re-contact the child for 
    other purposes. 
    
</li><li>
Request the name or online contact information of a 
    parent for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing 
    parental notification. 
    
</li><li>
Respond more than once directly to a specific request
             from a child (such as in the case where a child requests
             a newsletter subscription) and not used to re-contact the
             child for other purposes.  We will use our best efforts
             to provide parental notification, which will include the
             nature and intended use as well as an opportunity for the
             parent to prevent the use of the information and
             participation in the activity.
</li>
</ol>
</li><li>
We will NOT entice the child to divulge more 
  information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service. 
  
</li><li>
We will provide the parent a description of the 
  specific types of a personally identifiable information collected from their 
  child upon request. We will allow the parent to refuse further use or future 
  online collection of personally identifiable information and provide a way for 
  a parent to obtain any personally identifiable information collected from 
  their child. 
  
</li><li>
We will provide notice to children in age appropriate 
  terms of what personally identifiable information is to be collected. 
  
</li><li>
We will NOT provide any links to Web sites that are 
  unsuitable for children. 
  
</li><li>
We will encourage children to get their parent's
      permission before sharing personal information online.
