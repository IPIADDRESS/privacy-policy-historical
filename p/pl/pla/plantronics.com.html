              </b>Plantronics will collect personal information from our users 
              for different purposes. Information gathered online can be identified 
              as either anonymous or identifiable. Anonymous information is information 
              that cannot be traced back to the individual. Identifiable information 
              is information that is specific to the individual so that we can 
              deliver the right products and services to the individual. The following 
              lists the many ways in which we collect personal information from 
              our users and the type of information collected:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TO PURCHASE 
              PRODUCTS: To purchase lightweight communications headset products 
              and to obtain other services offered on www.plantronics.com, a user 
              has to create his/her profile by completing a questionnaire online. 
              Through the completion of the questionnaire by a user we collect 
              the following information: (i) full name; (ii) address; (iii) e-mail 
              address; (iv) credit card information; (v) password; and (vi) nickname. 
              The provision of this personal information is mandatory and if you 
              choose not to submit the requested information we will not be able 
              to provide you with the services offered on www.plantronics.com.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TO REGISTER 
              PRODUCTS: To register your purchased product online, we request 
              the following information: (i) full name; (ii) email address; and 
              (iii) purchase date. The provision of this information is mandatory 
              in order to register your purchase online. The provision of the 
              remaining information requested on the product registration form 
              is optional.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TO JOIN THE 
              PLANTRONICS TEAM: To join the Plantronics team, a user may consider 
              submitting his/her resume online. By virtue of our online resume 
              form we collect the following personal information: (i) full name; 
              (ii) home phone; (iii) e-mail; (iv) educational background; and 
              (v) the text of the resume. The provision of this information is 
              mandatory. In addition to mandatory information, we request information 
              such as address, current employment, ability to speak other languages 
              and a brief description of your career objectives. The provision 
              of this information is optional.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TO BECOME A 
              PLANTRONICS DEALER: To become a Plantronics dealer, a user must 
              complete an online application. By virtue of our online application 
              we collect personal information such as the user's full name and 
              e-mail address. The provision of this information is mandatory for 
              users who want to become dealers. In addition to this mandatory 
              information, we request information such as current employment, 
              phone and fax. The provision of this information is optional.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TO PARTICIPATE 
              IN ONLINE SURVEYS: If you desire, you may participate in Plantronics' 
              online surveys. If you choose to participate, we will collect anonymous 
              information about the environment you work in, telephone habits, 
              and demographic information. These surveys are developed in order 
              for us to understand what types of products are most effective for 
              our customers and to find the best ways to advertise to reach new 
              customers. Your participation in our online surveys is entirely 
              voluntary.</font></p>

              I have to Register With www.plantronics.com?<br>
              </b>All users can access the www.plantronics.com website without 
              being a registered user. However, you will not be able to access 
              certain areas or purchase our products online if you are not a registered 
              online user of www.plantronics.com. </font></p>

              Does Plantronics Use My Information?<br>
              </b>Personal information collected by us is used primarily for the 
              purpose it is collected: to facilitate the purchases online, to 
              register users' purchases, to process users' resumes or to consider 
              dealer applications. In particular, the users' shipping and billing 
              addresses are used for fulfilling the purchase orders and to bill 
              a user's credit card. The personal information provided in a resume 
              and dealer's application is used to consider the eligibility of 
              the candidates. In addition to the original purpose for which the 
              personal information is collected, we may use the personal information 
              to contact users to confirm information related to his/her order 
              or to advise a user if an item is on back order. Plantronics also 
              may use users' email address and/or phone number as follows provided 
              that the user grants his/her consent to such additional use:</font></p>
            <ul>

                surveys to obtain feedback on our products, our website, or on 
                other aspects of our business that impact you as a Plantronics 
                customer;</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to notify 
                users of new products or services we think may be of interest

                materials;</font></li>
            </ul>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Users will receive 
              such promotional materials only if they have indicated that they 
              do not object to receiving such information. If users prefer not 
              to receive e-mails or phone calls unrelated to their Plantronics 
              orders, they simply should not check the boxes on the registration 
              form that request their consent to this additional use of their 
              personal information. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may also 
              use personal information collected to contact users in connection 
              with the inappropriate use of the www.plantronics.com website.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We do not sell 
              or rent the personal information collected to third parties. To 
              facilitate the online purchases of our products, we use third party 
              distributors and shipping companies to ship orders, and a credit 
              card processing company to bill users for goods and services. We 
              have advised these companies of this Privacy Statement and have 
              requested that they do not retain, share, store or use personally 
              identifiable information for any purpose other than to implement 
              the sales transaction.</font></p>

              About Security of Data Transmission?</b><br>
              Please note that at plantronics.com there is a form where you can 
              transmit credit card information in order to complete a purchase 
              transaction. Any time we ask for a credit card number, we transmit 
              that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, 
              SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. Unfortunately, no data transmission 
              over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, 
              while we strive to protect your personal information, Plantronics 
              cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit 
              to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at 
              your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best 
              effort to ensure its security on our systems.</font></p>

              profile at any time by going to the "My Profile" page on our website.

              changes on our homepage (<a href="http://www.plantronics.com/index.html">www.plantronics.com</a>) 
              so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how

              If at any point we decide to use personal information in a manner 
              different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will 
              notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to

              A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser

              uses cookies to establish a link between your computer and a Plantronics' 
              distributor. This link assures that when you return to plantronics.com, 
              you will see the same distributor's information and be able to check 
              the progress of your order online with that distributor. </font></p>
