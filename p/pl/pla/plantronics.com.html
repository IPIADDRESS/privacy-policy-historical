          Information Does Plantronics Collect?<br>
          </b>Plantronics will collect personal information from our users for 
          different purposes. Information gathered online can be identified as 
          either anonymous or identifiable. Anonymous information is information 
          that cannot be traced back to the individual. Identifiable information 
          is information that is specific to the individual so that we can deliver 
          the right products and services to the individual. The following lists 
          the many ways in which we collect personal information from our users 
          and the type of information collected:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS: 
          To purchase lightweight communications headset products and to obtain 
          other services offered on www.plantronics.com, a user has to create 
          his/her profile by completing a questionnaire online. Through the completion 
          of the questionnaire by a user we collect the following information: 
          (i) full name; (ii) address; (iii) e-mail address; (iv) credit card 
          information; (v) password; and (vi) nickname. The provision of this 
          personal information is mandatory and if you choose not to submit the 
          requested information we will not be able to provide you with the services 
          offered on www.plantronics.com.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TO REGISTER PRODUCTS: 
          To register your purchased product online, we request the following 
          information: (i) full name; (ii) email address; and (iii) purchase date. 
          The provision of this information is mandatory in order to register 
          your purchase online. The provision of the remaining information requested 
          on the product registration form is optional.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TO JOIN THE PLANTRONICS 
          TEAM: To join the Plantronics team, a user may consider submitting his/her 
          resume online. By virtue of our online resume form we collect the following 
          personal information: (i) full name; (ii) home phone; (iii) e-mail; 
          (iv) educational background; and (v) the text of the resume. The provision 
          of this information is mandatory. In addition to mandatory information, 
          we request information such as address, current employment, ability 
          to speak other languages and a brief description of your career objectives. 
          The provision of this information is optional.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TO BECOME A PLANTRONICS 
          DEALER: To become a Plantronics dealer, a user must complete an online 
          application. By virtue of our online application we collect personal 
          information such as the user's full name and e-mail address. The provision 
          of this information is mandatory for users who want to become dealers. 
          In addition to this mandatory information, we request information such 
          as current employment, phone and fax. The provision of this information 
          is optional.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TO PARTICIPATE IN 
          ONLINE SURVEYS: If you desire, you may participate in Plantronics' online 
          surveys. If you choose to participate, we will collect anonymous information 
          about the environment you work in, telephone habits, and demographic 
          information. These surveys are developed in order for us to understand 
          what types of products are most effective for our customers and to find 
          the best ways to advertise to reach new customers. Your participation 
          in our online surveys is entirely voluntary.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="doregister"></a>Do 
          I have to Register With www.plantronics.com?<br>
          </b>All users can access the www.plantronics.com website without being 
          a registered user. However, you will not be able to access certain areas 
          or purchase our products online if you are not a registered online user 
          of www.plantronics.com. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="howuse"></a>How 
          Does Plantronics Use My Information?<br>
          </b>Personal information collected by us is used primarily for the purpose 
          it is collected: to facilitate the purchases online, to register users' 
          purchases, to process users' resumes or to consider dealer applications. 
          In particular, the users' shipping and billing addresses are used for 
          fulfilling the purchase orders and to bill a user's credit card. The 
          personal information provided in a resume and dealer's application is 
          used to consider the eligibility of the candidates. In addition to the 
          original purpose for which the personal information is collected, we 
          may use the personal information to contact users to confirm information 
          related to his/her order or to advise a user if an item is on back order. 
          Plantronics also may use users' email address and/or phone number as 
          follows provided that the user grants his/her consent to such additional 
          use:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">in our internal 
            surveys to obtain feedback on our products, our website, or on other 
            aspects of our business that impact you as a Plantronics customer;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to notify users 
            of new products or services we think may be of interest to them;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to send promotional 
            materials;</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Users will receive 
          such promotional materials only if they have indicated that they do 
          not object to receiving such information. If users prefer not to receive 
          e-mails or phone calls unrelated to their Plantronics orders, they simply 
          should not check the boxes on the registration form that request their 
          consent to this additional use of their personal information. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may also use 
          personal information collected to contact users in connection with the 
          inappropriate use of the www.plantronics.com website.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We do not sell or 
          rent the personal information collected to third parties. To facilitate 
          the online purchases of our products, we use third party distributors 
          and shipping companies to ship orders, and a credit card processing 
          company to bill users for goods and services. We have advised these 
          companies of this Privacy Statement and have requested that they do 
          not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information 
          for any purpose other than to implement the sales transaction.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="whatsecurity"></a>What 
          About Security of Data Transmission?</b><br>
          Please note that at plantronics.com there is a form where you can transmit 
          credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction. 
          Any time we ask for a credit card number, we transmit that credit card 
          number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure 
          socket layer) encryption. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the 
          Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we 
          strive to protect your personal information, Plantronics cannot ensure 
          or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from 
          our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once 
          we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its 
          security on our systems.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="canupdate"></a>Can 
          I Correct/Update the Information Collected About Me?</b><br>
          You have the right to correct/update the personal information collected 
          about you at www.plantronics.com. You can make changes to your personal 
          profile at any time by going to the "My Profile" page on our website. 
          You will need your Logon ID (user name) and password in order to access 
          your personal information.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="willnotify"></a>Will 
          You Notify Me in the Event of Changes to this Privacy Statement?</b> 
          If we decide to change our Privacy Statement, we will post those changes 
          on our homepage (<a href="http://www.plantronics.com/index.html">www.plantronics.com</a>) 
          so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we 
          use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at 
          any point we decide to use personal information in a manner different 
          from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users 
          by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we 
          use their information in this new manner. We will use information in 
          accordance with the Privacy Statement under which the information was 
          collected.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="misc"></a>Miscellaneous</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="contests"></a>Contests/Sweepstakes</b><br>
          From time-to-time our site requests information from users via contests. 
          Participation in these contests is completely voluntary and the user 
          therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. 
          Information requested may include contact information (such as name 
          and shipping address), and demographic information. Contact information 
          will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. If you choose to 
          enter into one of our contests/sweepstakes, please be aware that we 
          may share contestants' anonymous information with our advertisers and 
          affiliated partners.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="optin"></a><b>How 
          Can I Opt-In?</b><br>
          We provide registered users the opportunity to opt-in to receiving updates 
          on the new products offered on plantronics.com and promotional materials 
          from us. The opt-in procedure is fairly easy and may be exercised at 
          the creation of your customer profile by checking the appropriate box.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="optout"></a><b>How 
          Can I Opt-Out?</b><br>
          If you have opted in and later desire to opt-out from further receiving 
          updates on the new products offered on www.plantronics.com and promotional 
          materials from us, you can make this change at any time by going to 
          the "My Profile" page on our website. You will need your Logon ID (user 
          name) and password in order to access your personal information and 
          effect this change.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="password"></a><b>Why 
          Do I Need an ID and Password?</b><br>
          At our e-commerce site we provide an area for you to store your billing 
          address, and shipping addresses. This is your private information and 
          you should keep it secure. We also require that you enter your Logon 
          ID (nick name) and password for accessing Order Status where you will 
          view the details of products ordered from Plantronics.</font></p>

          A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from 
          a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Plantronics uses 
          cookies to establish a link between your computer and a Plantronics' 
          distributor. This link assures that when you return to plantronics.com, 
          you will see the same distributor's information and be able to check 
          the progress of your order online with that distributor. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You have choices 
          with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you 
          have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie

          you may be unable to link back to the distributor where your order was 
          placed and thus, you will not be able to track your order. You can still
