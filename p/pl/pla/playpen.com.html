            	<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
               
                <ol>
                  	<li>General<br>
                  			The following presents important information relating to Playpen's comprehensive Privacy Policy. Because protecting your privacy is very important to Playpen, we have established a privacy policy that safeguards your personal information, and are committed to protecting its confidentiality. We will limit the collection and use of personal information, or Individual Information (as defined below), to what is necessary to administer our business, provide you with the highest quality service, and offer you opportunities we think will be of interest. We will NOT disclose any Individual Information, unless by order of subpoena, or if the disclosure of Individual Information to your credit or debit card bank or the bank with which you hold a Direct Debit account may help us prove the legitimacy of your credit card or debit charge or bill. We actively participate in industry associations and community groups to support strong and effective privacy guidelines and practices in the interactive environment.
                  	</li>
                  	<li> Types of Individual Information<br>
                    Individual Information is any information, data or records that relate to your Playpen membership or use of Playpen and identifies you or your individual Member account. The three types of Individual Information are;
                		<ol type="i">
                      		<li>"Identity and billing information," such as your name, street address, telephone number, billing information, and any screen names associated with your account;</li>
                      		<li>"Navigational and transactional information," such as information about where you go or what you buy through Playpen;</li>
                      		<li>"Private communications," such as the contents of email, IM, or private chat room communications.</li>
                    	</ol>
                  	</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h2>MEMBER IDENTITY AND BILLING INFORMATION </h2>
                <ol>
                  	<li> Collection and Storage<br>
                  	We may maintain the following types of identity and billing information: your name, street address, telephone number(s), length of membership, and payment information. We may also keep information on your communications with our Customer Service department and Performers, and general account history, such as accumulated usage credits or written complaints relating to your account. We safeguard Individual Information from unauthorized access and only authorized employees or agents who need to carry out legitimate business functions are permitted access to Members' Individual Information. Employees who violate Playpen privacy policies are subject to disciplinary actions, including termination when appropriate. We may use agents, who are bound by strict confidentiality guidelines, to perform storage, processing, and other limited functions on Playpen's behalf.</li>
                  	<li>Use<br>
                  	We use identity and billing information to administer our business,   ensure that you are properly billed and offer you opportunities (e.g.   pop-ups or email) that may be of interest.</li>
                  	<li>Disclosure<br>
                  	We do not release Members' telephone numbers, credit or debit card   numbers, or checking account or other bank account numbers (or other   Individual Information, such as navigational or transactional   information or private communications content). Our policy is not to   disclose identity information to third parties that would link a Members   screen name(s) with a Members actual name, unless required to do so by   law or legal process served on Playpen (e.g. a subpoena). Playpen, at   its sole discretion, reserves the right to make exceptions to this   policy in extraordinary circumstances on a case-by-case basis. When   feasible, we do allow our Members to access and verify their Member   Identity and Billing Information. We also allow our Members to request   corrections to this Information. Playpen intends to abide by applicable   laws governing the disclosure to governmental entities of Individual   Information and other records. If we are under a legal obligation to   disclose Individual Information to a private citizen or entity, we may   make efforts under the circumstances to notify the affected Member(s) in   advance of releasing it in order to provide the Member(s) an   opportunity to pursue any available legal protection.</li>
                  	<li>Compelling Obligation<br>
                  	Although Playpen will take reasonable measures not to disclose information about you or the contents of your communications, we may be compelled to do so in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary (a) to comply with the law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to enforce these terms and conditions; (d) to respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; or (e) to protect the interests of Playpen or others.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>NAVIGATIONAL AND TRANSACTIONAL INFORMATION </h2>
        		<ol>
          			<li>Collection<br>
          			We may collect and store certain navigational and transactional information, such as data on the choices you make from the range of available services, and the times and ways you use Playpen.</li>
          			<li> Use<br>
          			Playpen uses navigational and transactional information to personalize   Playpen and for programming and editorial research. For example, we may   use this information to understand our Members' reactions to menu items,   Content, and services offered through Playpen and to customize Playpen   based on our Members' interests.</li>
          			<li>Disclosure<br>
          			Playpen will not disclose to third parties navigational or   transactional information (e.g. what you view through Playpen), except   to comply with applicable law or valid legal process (e.g. search   warrant or court order).</li>
        		</ol>
        		<h2>PRIVATE COMMUNICATIONS </h2>
        		<ol>
          			<li>Collection and Storage<br>
         			The Playpen computer system does record and retain all IM and chat room communications. However, to keep copies of any communications, you should store them on your personal computer hard drive or in print form. You agree that Playpen may employ email virus-checking technology to protect its system and its members from viruses.</li>
          			<li>Use<br>
          			Playpen treats private communications on or through Playpen as strictly confidential. Playpen does not access, use or disclose the contents of private communications, except in limited circumstances as specifically provided below. You acknowledge that private communications directed at a person or entity, including Playpen, may be used or disclosed by the intended recipient(s) without restrictions relating to privacy or confidentiality.</li>
          			<li> Disclosure<br>
            		Playpen does not access or disclose the contents of private communications (e.g. email, IM, private rooms, online communications), unless it in good faith believes that such action is necessary 
            		<ol type="i">
              			<li>to comply with applicable law or valid legal process (e.g. search warrant or court order); </li>
              			<li>to protect the rights or property of Playpen; or</li>
              			<li> in emergencies when Playpen believes that physical safety is at risk. Playpen reserves the right to treat as public any private chat room whose directory or room name is published or becomes generally known or available.</li>
            		</ol>
          			</li>
        		</ol>

        		<ol>
          			<li>Either you or Playpen may terminate your membership at any time. This is your sole right and remedy with respect to any dissatisfaction with Playpen, including, but not limited to,
