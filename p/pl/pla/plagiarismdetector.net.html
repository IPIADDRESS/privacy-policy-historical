that information from our systems. If you are under the age of 13, please
do not provide any personal information through the Site, Service, App,

permission.
</p>

combination of physical, technical, and logical security measures. The
security of the data stored locally in any of our Software installed on

<h4 id="sec27">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>
<p>
CalOPPA is the first state law in the United States that requires
commercial websites and online services to publish a privacy policy. The
law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any individual or
company in the US (and conceivably the world) that operates sites
collecting PII from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
policy on its website stating precisely the information that it collects
and those individuals or companies with whom it is shared.
</p>
<p>
For further information, visit:
https://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
</p>
<p>
According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Users can visit the site anonymously.
</li>
<li>
Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our
home page or at least, the first significant page after entering our
website.
</li>
<li>
Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' in it, and it
can easily be found on the page specified above.
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sec28">Fair Information Practices</h4>
<p>
The Fair Information Practices Principles is the backbone of the privacy
law in the United States. It also plays a significant role in developing
data protection laws across the globe. It is, therefore, essential to
understand the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be
implemented in compliance with the various privacy laws to protect personal
information.
</p>
<p>
In agreement with the Fair Information Practices, following responsive
actions will be taken, should a data breach instance occur:
<br>
<br>

<p>
We will notify you via email:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Within 7 business days
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We will notify the users via in-site notification
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Within 7 business days
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle according to which
individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against
those who collect and process data and fail to adhere to the law. As per
this principle individuals not only have enforceable rights against data
users but also that they have recourse to courts or legal agencies to
investigate and/or prosecute by data processors.
