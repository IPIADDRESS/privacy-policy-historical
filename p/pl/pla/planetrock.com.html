	<p>6.1 You may have read about "cookies".&nbsp; These are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Planet Rock Ltd uses cookies to identify registered users without needing to ask for registration details every time you access one of our websites. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information.&nbsp; Occasionally, we may use cookies to track browsing actions or monitor usage patterns on our site.&nbsp; This helps us administer our websites.&nbsp; In particular, we may track users as they travel through our websites - for instance, cookies may be used to count the total number of unique users who are accessing our websites over a particular period of time. This information will not be shared with a third party at an individual level, and is used to make our systems more efficient. In addition, cookies can control the display of ads, to ensure that you do not see the same ad too many times in a single session. You may also notice that our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies, either directly or when you link to their sites. We cannot directly control what our advertisers or these cookies do.</p>
	<p>6.2 If you are concerned about cookies, you can turn them off or refuse to accept cookies by modifying the settings in your browser.

<blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
	<p>For the reasons set out in this Privacy Policy and for technical and operational reasons, your personal information may from time to time, on our behalf, be transferred, processed or stored on servers based outside of the EEA.&nbsp; You should be aware that such countries outside of the EEA may not offer the same level of protection for your data.&nbsp; For example, your data may be processed to allow personalised radio streaming, to process your entry into a competition, to fulfil any order you make for goods or services, to process any payment details or to provide support services. By submitting data to us you consent to such transfer, storing and processing outside the EEA.&nbsp; We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including steps to help ensure that contractors operating on our behalf are subject to our standard technical and security obligations to provide an adequate level of protection for your information.&nbsp; </p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">8. Security</span></p>
<blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
	<p>8.1 We use up to date industry procedures and technology to keep personal data as safe and secure as possible and to protect against loss, unauthorised disclosure or access.

	<p>8.2 Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.&nbsp; Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.&nbsp; Once we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p></blockquote>
