<p>7. Transfer of personal information outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA")<br>
	For the reasons set out in this Privacy Policy and for technical and operational reasons, your personal information may from time to time, on our behalf, be transferred, processed or stored on servers based outside of the EEA.&nbsp; You should be aware that such countries outside of the EEA may not offer the same level of protection for your data.&nbsp; For example, your data may be processed to allow personalised radio streaming, to process your entry into a competition, to fulfil any order you make for goods or services, to process any payment details or to provide support services. By submitting data to us you consent to such transfer, storing and processing outside the EEA.&nbsp; We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including steps to help ensure that contractors operating on our behalf are subject to our standard technical and security obligations to provide an adequate level of protection for your information.&nbsp; </p>

<p><br>
	8. Security</p>

<p>8.1 We use up to date industry procedures and technology to keep personal data as safe and secure as possible and to protect against loss, unauthorised disclosure or access. Planet Rock Ltd and our associated companies follow the relevant legal requirements and use all reasonable precautions to ensure only responsible third parties see the information. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or any actions of any third parties who receive the information.&nbsp; </p>

<p>8.2 Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.&nbsp; Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.&nbsp; Once we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. The Data Protection Act and the Information Commissioner</p>

<p>9.1 In the UK, the Data Protection Act provides a framework for the safety and security of personal data and the uses to which such personal data is put. The Information Commissioner is the UK's independent public body set up to protect personal information and provide information to individuals and organisations.&nbsp; Please see <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk">www.ico.gov.uk</a> for more information. </p>

<p>9.2 We are registered with the Information Commissioner as a 'data controller' under registration number Z8410660. We will ensure that all personal information supplied by you to us is held and dealt with in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and its relevant subordinate legislation and we will comply with the principles set out in that Act. When you supply any personal information to us we will meet our legal obligations towards you in the way that we deal with that information. In accordance with the data protection principles we must collect personal information fairly and let you know how we will use it and whether we will pass the information on to anyone else. For the avoidance of doubt, we will not supply your personal information to third parties without your express prior consent other than as set out in this Privacy Policy. We will ensure that any information will be held only as long as is necessary to ensure that our service runs smoothly. </p>

<p>9.3 The Data Protection Act gives you the right to access information held about you.&nbsp; Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act.&nbsp; Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.<br>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>10. Updating your information</p>

<p>10.1 If you are registered with us, you may update your personal information at any time via the "My Details" page for web users. You can get to the "My Details Page" or equivalent from most pages on our websites if you are logged-on.&nbsp; If you are a text user then the text messages you receive from us will alert you to options for unsubscription and/ or change of details - please follow these messages. In addition if you believe the information we hold about you to be out of date or inaccurate please email us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@planetrock.com">webmaster@planetrock.com</a> or contact us at Planet Rock, 54 Lisson Street, London, NW1 5DF. <br>

<p>11. Parents</p>

<p>11.1 Planet Rock Ltd is committed to the safety and privacy of children who visit and participate in our services. For those activities that require us to collect personal information (e.g. competitions), we will only collect personal information which is necessary to enable us to administer the relevant activity. We encourage parents and guardians to watch over their children's online use. Please educate your children to always ask for your permission before they provide personal information.<br>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. Children</p>

<p>12.1 Remember to be smart and safe online. Always ask your parent or guardian for permission before you give out any personal information. This could include your name, email address, home address, telephone number, your school or any other information about yourself that would enable someone to contact you either online or offline.</p>

<p>12.2 From time to time we run online competitions that you may be able to enter. Always remember to ask your parent or guardian for permission before entering any competition.</p>
