<h1>Project Playlist, Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Last Updated:  January 7, 2009</h2>

<h3>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h3>

<p>This site is operated by Project Playlist, Inc. (“Playlist”). At Playlist, we understand that you
value your privacy, and we want to help make your experience with our site, software, and services
(referred to in this policy collectively as our “services”) satisfying and safe. This policy describes
our collection of information, including personal information, in connection with our services, and
explains how we use and disclose this information. To make this policy easy to find, we make it
available from our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.</p>

<h3>Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It</h3>

<p><strong>"Personal information,"</strong> as used in this policy, is information that may be used to identify an
individual, such as name or email address. We collect personal information in the course of providing
our services to you and you may also make personal information available to others as you use the
services. Below are some examples of the types of personal information we collect and the ways in which
we use it:</p>

<p>Information you provide - We collect personal information that users provide through optional,
voluntary submissions, such as via the use of email and our download forms used to download tools. We
use personal information we collect to respond to your inquiry or request, to provide, improve, and
develop our services, to tailor your user experience, to prevent or investigate fraudulent or
inappropriate usage of our services, to enable you to participate in contests and promotions, for
research and development and for the other purposes described in this policy. Depending on your
settings, certain information you provide may be available to other users.</p>

<p>In addition, we may use your email address to deliver targeted marketing messages from us.
You may opt-out from receiving these marketing messages by following the instructions provided in
the messages. You may also provide personal information to us in other ways, such as by requesting
user support.</p>

<p>Information from third parties - We may receive personal information from third parties about
their users, and may combine this information with other personal information we maintain about you.
If we do so, this policy governs the combined information.</p>

<h3>Non-Personal Information</h3>

<p>We may also collect information that is not personally identifiable, and may aggregate personal
information or otherwise render it anonymous (that is, non-personally identifiable). We use non-personally
identifiable information we collect to operate our network, to provide, improve, and develop our services,
to tailor your user experience, to prevent or investigate fraudulent or inappropriate usage of our
services, to enable you to participate in contests and promotions, for research and development and for
the other purposes described in this policy. We may use this anonymous information for various purposes
and may share it with third parties. Below are some examples of the types of non-personal information we
collect and some specific examples of how we use this information:</p>

<p>Usage tracking - We may collect non-personal information from your use of our services. For example,
we may collect information about user traffic and usage patterns throughout our site, and similar
information regarding the use of our software and services. We may also track click-through information,
such as IP addresses, from the messages we send to our users. We use the information we collect in
these manners to, for example, improve our services, to develop new products and services, to gauge
the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, to discourage and address abusive and fraudulent use of
our services, and to help our users with troubleshooting issues.</p>

<p>Cookies - When you visit our site, we or our advertisers may send one or more cookies - a small
file containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser, or
recognize a cookie that is already on your machine. We use cookies to improve the quality of our
service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, and to customize your experience.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all
cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some services may not function properly
if your cookies are disabled.</p>

<p>Playlists and streams - We may use general information about our members’ playlists or streaming
activity that help our advertisers understand the musical tastes of our members. Our advertisers may
use the information that we provide in order to direct certain types of ads to specific pages where
users may have expected interest in the product.</p>

<p>If we directly combine any non-personal information gathered through passive means with personal
information, we treat the combined information as personal information under this policy. Otherwise,
we use information collected by passive means in aggregated or other non-personally identifiable forms.</p>

<h3>Disclosure of Personal and Other Information</h3>

<p>We may provide personal information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and other trusted
businesses or persons for the purpose of providing our services and for our other purposes described
in this policy. We limit the personal information shared with these third parties to that which is
necessary to carry out those functions and require that our partners respect and comply with applicable
law as a condition of doing business with them. Except as described in this policy or otherwise
specifically disclosed to you at the point of collection, we will not provide your personal information
to third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>

<p>We may share personal information with third parties (including regulatory or law enforcement
authorities) in order to carry out a user's request or if we believe that doing so is legally required
or is in our interest to protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to,
enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or property of others.</p>

<p><strong>If you post any of your information to a public area of our site, please be aware that it is no
longer "personal information" for the purposes of this policy, and we or anyone else may use such
information without restriction. If you provide access to personal or other information to a limited
set of other users through any of our privacy controls or other settings, please understand that
Playlist has no control over how others may collect, use or disclose such information.</strong></p>

<h3>Our Commitment to Data Security</h3>

<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information,
we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and
secure the information we collect online. Please be aware, however, that no data transmissions over
the Internet or other networks can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure
or warrant the security or integrity of any information you transmit to us. You transmit information
to us at your own risk. Once we receive personal information, we make reasonable efforts to protect
it from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. But we cannot represent or
guarantee that personal information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.</p>

<p>If Playlist learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that
you can take appropriate protective steps. Playlist may post a notice through the service if a security
breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to access the service.
Playlist may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these
circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security
breach in writing.</p>

<p>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</p>

<p>Playlist does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.
In the event that Playlist learns it has collected any such information it will take steps immediately
to delete any such information. The services are not directed at children.</p>

<h3>How You Can Access or Correct Your Information</h3>

<p>You can access certain of your personally identifiable information that we collect online and
maintain by clicking on "edit" on your account page. We use this procedure to better safeguard your
information. You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by changing
any of the information on that page. To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable
steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Sites, Software, and Services</h3>

<p>Our services may contain links to and interoperability with third-party sites, software, and
services. Any links or interoperability to third-party sites, software, or services are provided for
your convenience only, and we do not have control over the content or privacy and security practices and
policies of such third parties. Any personal information that you provide to our data destination
partners or to other third parties is subject to that third party’s privacy practices and policies, not
this policy. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before
providing them with personal information.</p>

<h3>Business Transfers</h3>

<p>Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger,
acquisition, or sale of company assets, as well as in the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy
or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of our business assets.</p>

<h3>International Visitors</h3>

<p>This site is hosted in the United States, and we provide our services from the United States. If you
use our services from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use
that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United
States. The United States does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and some other regions.
By providing your personal information, you consent to the transfer of your personal data to the
United States and the use of your personal information, in accordance with this policy.</p>

<h3>Information Retention and Disposal</h3>

<p>We may retain personal information for as long as we have a business need for it or as applicable
laws or regulations or government orders require us to retain it. Additionally, the service may enable
you (or other users) to save information including information that you have made public or allowed
certain users to access or see.</p>

<h3>Changes and Updates</h3>

<p>We may occasionally update this policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at
the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about our
collection, use and disclosure of personal information.</p>
