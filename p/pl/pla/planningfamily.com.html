<strong>ARTICLE I- PRINCIPLES:</strong>
</p><p>
<u>Section 1.01 - Information PlanningFamily.com Gathers and Tracks</u>

</p><ul>PlanningFamily.com gathers personally identifiable and other information about users (such as name, postal address, email address, gender, date of birth, interests, other demographic information, etc.). This information is obtained in connection with a user's registration on our site and/or by completing advertiser offers. All information submitted in the registration process or by completing advertiser offers is subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy Statement. By completing advertiser offers on PlanningFamily.com, users are submitting their personally identifiable information to the advertiser as well as PlanningFamily.com. PlanningFamily.com receives information about users who have registered on the PlanningFamily.com website to receive offers for free products and services from third party marketers such as Family Marketing, Inc. and its affiliates.
<p>  
This Privacy Policy applies to consumers that have signed up directly on the PlanningFamily.com website or through the websites of our media partners. We may use the personally identifiable information that you supply to us and work with other third party businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our users via direct mail, email and telemarketing. These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference services, data enhancement, suppression and validation, and email marketing.</p></ul>

<u>Section 1.02 -- Cookies &amp; Automatic Information</u>

<ul>To enable us to provide content that users need and desire, we collect aggregated site-visitation statistics using cookies. A Cookie is simply a small data file we place on your computer's hard drive when you first visit the Web Site ("Cookie"). This file contains a unique number that helps us identify you when you return to the Web Site. Cookies are employed by thousands of web sites to enhance users' web viewing experience. Cookies can neither damage user files nor can they read information from users' hard drives. Allowing us to create a Cookie on your hard drive will not give us or any other site access to the rest of your computer's hard drive, and only we will be able to read the Cookie that the Web Site creates. Most web browsers automatically accept Cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block Cookies in the future. The "Help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will explain how you can prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, how to set the browser to inform you when you receive a new Cookie, or how to reject Cookies altogether.
<p>
Our web server automatically collects information from your computer and navigation patterns when you visit our site, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the computer's operating system, the type of browser you use, and the specific web pages visited during your connection. We may also track data such as the total number of visits to our website and the number of visitors to each page of our website. We may use this information, in aggregate form, for system maintenance and to better understand how our visitors use our site and services so that we can make them better. PlanningFamily.com may also share statistical or demographic information in aggregate form with third parties for marketing or research purposes. This aggregate data will not contain any information that personally identifies you.</p></ul>

<u>Section 1.03 -- Use of Information</u>

<ul>PlanningFamily.com uses information voluntarily given by expectant parents in order to provide such individuals with information on products and/or services that may be of interest to them. This information is used to provide our users with relevant trial offers, free samples, free coupons and more.
<p>
We and/or our marketing partners may enhance and/or merge personally identifiable information about users with data collected from other sources to use in direct and/or online marketing and, to the extent permitted by law, individual reference and look-up service programs. In the event we enhance and/or merge such personally identifiable information with data collected from other sources, we will take reasonable steps to maintain the integrity and quality of that information. 
In addition, users may receive postal mailings from our marketing partners as well as periodic postal mailings from us with information on products and services or relevant offers. Users may also be contacted via email or telephone by us or our marketing partners.</p></ul>

<u>Section 1.04 -- Sharing of Information</u>

<ul>PlanningFamily.com shares or uses the information described above to help advertisers and third party marketers better understand the demographics of our registrants and for their marketing purposes. PlanningFamily.com shares personally identifiable information (including information that has been enhanced with information from other sources) with advertisers, third party marketers, and our affiliates for their direct and/or online marketing efforts and, to the extent permitted by law, for individual reference and look-up service programs. While PlanningFamily.com seeks to contractually obligate our partners to treat information in accordance with accepted marketing practices, PlanningFamily.com does not control the practices of its advertisers or third party marketers. 
If users indicate that they do not want to have their email address shared with third parties for general email marketing solicitations, PlanningFamily.com will limit the use of their data to certain direct marketing services. These services currently include the provision of personally identifiable information to third parties to validate and enhance existing information held by marketers about their customers. For example, a marketer may use personally identifiable data provided by PlanningFamily.com to add information about the user to its own file for use by that marketer in its own marketing efforts. Similarly, a marketer may use such data merely to verify or validate the accuracy of data about such user that the marketer already possesses; to suppress further marketing messages being sent by such marketer to a user; or in connection with individual reference and look-up service programs (i.e., services used primarily to identify, locate, or verify the identity of an individual).
<p>
Users' requests to unsubscribe from PlanningFamily.com email solicitations will be processed promptly, but in any event within 10 days. In the event that technical difficulties prevent the immediate processing of unsubscribe requests, such requests will be processed as soon as technically feasible. In addition, PlanningFamily.com will not knowingly share information that supports pornographic promotions or sites.
</p><p>
At all times, PlanningFamily.com reserves the right to disclose information where required by law or to comply with valid legal process (such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order), to protect the company's rights or property (including without limitation in the event of a transfer of control of PlanningFamily.com or substantially all of its assets), or during emergencies when safety is at risk. Nonetheless, users will have the opportunity to choose whether or not they want to receive further information and offers from any division of Family Marketing, Inc. following a change of control.</p></ul>

<u>Section 1.05 -- Unsubscribe Policy</u>

<ul>By submitting personal information on PlanningFamily.com so that users can receive free offers, users allow PlanningFamily.com and its affiliates to make that personally identifiable information available to third parties that are making such offers in accordance with the terms of this privacy policy.
<p>
PlanningFamily.com provides users the option to unsubscribe from receiving information sent via electronic mailings by PlanningFamily.com on behalf of third party advertisers who are our clients, or to unsubscribe from PlanningFamily.com sharing information with advertisers or third party marketers for promotional purposes. Users may unsubscribe to emails sent via PlanningFamily.com at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every PlanningFamily.com emailing.

Sunset Blvd. Suite 400, West Hollywood, CA 90069.
</p><p>
