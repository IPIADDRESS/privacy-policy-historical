        We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy and will notify you of these changes by posting the modified terms on Our online site. We recommend that you revisit this Privacy Policy regularly.<br>
        <br>

        <span class="mainTextSubHeader">2. INFORMATION COLLECTED</span><br>
        We consider information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, first and last name, date of birth, credit card information, home or other physical address, email address, phone number or other contact information to be Personal Information ('<strong>Personal Information</strong>'). You may be asked to provide Personal Information when you use Our website, register for an account or to use the Service. The Personal Information that We collect may include information such as: contact information (including telephone number), shipping information, billing information, transaction history, website usage preferences, and feedback regarding the Service. This information is held by Us on servers based in Gibraltar and/or Alderney and elsewhere from time to time. In addition, when you interact with the Service, Our servers keep an activity log unique to you that collects certain administrative and traffic information including: source IP address, time of access, date of access, web page(s) visited, language use, software crash reports and type of browser used. This information is essential for the provision and quality of the Service. We do not collect Personal Information about you on the Service without your knowledge.<br>
        <br>

        <span class="mainTextSubHeader">3. MEANS OF COLLECTING AND PROCESSING DATA</span><br>
        We may automatically collect certain data as discussed above and receive Personal Information about you where you provide such information through the Service or other communications and interactions with Us. We may also receive Personal Information from online vendors and service providers that refer you to Our sites, and from customer lists lawfully acquired from third-party vendors. In addition, We may engage the services of third-party service providers to provide technical support, process your online transactions and maintain your online account. We will have access to any information you provide to such vendors, service providers and third-party e-commerce services, and We will use the Personal Information as set out in this Privacy Policy below. This information will only be disclosed to third parties outside the bwin.party group in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We take steps to ensure that Our arrangements with third-party service providers and online vendors protect your privacy.<br>
        <br>

From time-to-time, We may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and, therefore, you have the choice of whether or not to disclose such information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name, correspondence address and telephone number), and demographic information (such as zip or postal code or age). If you choose to participate in a survey or contest and win, by accepting any contest prize or winnings from Us, you consent to use of your name and likeness for advertising and promotional purposes without additional compensation, except where prohibited by law. Unless you have elected not to receive promotional information, We may also use your Personal Information (including your email address and phone number) to provide you with information regarding our products, services and promotions, including other gaming products (including online poker, casino and bingo services) and products and services from third parties carefully selected by Us.<br>

        We cannot ensure the protection of any information or images that you provide to a third-party online site that links to or from Our sites or any information collected by any third party administering Our affiliate program (if applicable) or any other program, since these third-party online sites are owned and operated independently of Us.

If you have questions about a third party's information practices, please read its privacy policy.
