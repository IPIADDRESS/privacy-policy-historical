    <p>Privacy Policy</p>
    <p>Last updated on: September 3, 2009</p>
    <p><strong>Our Commitment to Privacy</strong><br>
      Your privacy is important to Blue Frog Gaming, Inc. (“Blue Frog Gaming,” “we,” “us,” or  “our”).&nbsp; We want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and  disclose information collected from you during your use of our website,  located at <a href="http://www.bluefroggaming.com" title="Linkification: http://www.hive7.com">http://www.bluefroggaming.com</a> (“Our Website”), or through any website providing our online game  services (each website, a “Site”).&nbsp; To that end, we provide this  Privacy Policy to explain our online information practices and the  choices you can make about the way your personally identifiable  information is collected and used.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies to all  information collected from you during your use of a Site.&nbsp; By using a  Site or by providing any personally identifiable information to us, you  signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose of a Site</strong><br>
    The main purpose of each Site is to provide online social games on  social platforms.&nbsp; We may also provide information and services to  existing and prospective users of our online game services.</p>
    <p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong><br>
    Please note that we review our privacy policies from time to time, and  as such we may revise this Privacy Policy, at our sole discretion, by  posting an amended policy on Our Website.&nbsp; We ask that you periodically  review Our Website to ensure continuing familiarity with the most  current version of our Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Any changes to our Privacy  Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Privacy  Policy on Our Website.&nbsp; Use of a Site following such changes  constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy then in  effect.&nbsp; You will be able to determine when this Privacy Policy was  last revised by checking the “Last updated” information that appears at  the top of this page.</p>
    <p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong><br>
    Personally Identifiable Information:&nbsp; A Site does not automatically  collect any personally identifiable information (information that  identifies you or can identify you as an individual) from visitors of a  Site.&nbsp; We collect personally identifiable information only when you  provide it in the course of interacting with a Site, such as when you  submit your email address, purchase our products or services, or ask to  be contacted by one of our professionals or sales representatives.&nbsp; In  so doing, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable  information, such as your age, name, postal address, email address,  telephone number, user IDs and passwords, or billing and credit card  information.&nbsp; You may choose not to provide such personally  identifiable information, but this may limit our ability to provide you  with the requested product or service or otherwise contact you.</p>
    <p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:&nbsp; As part of administrating  a Site, our servers may automatically collect non-personally  identifiable information.&nbsp; This is aggregated information or other  information that does not identify you, such as the type of browser you  are using, the type of operating system you are using, the domain name  of your Internet service provider, your Internet Protocol (IP) address,  pages you visited on a Site, and usage patterns of a Site.<br>
      Cookies and Tracking Pixels:&nbsp; We also may use cookies, tracking pixels and  other technologies to track activity on a Site and to enhance the  functionality of a Site.&nbsp; Cookies are small pieces of information that  our server places on a visitor’s computer hard drive to enable that  person to more easily communicate and interact with a Site and to  provide us with important information on how visitors use a Site.&nbsp;  Tracking pixels (also known as Web beacons, action tags, or transparent  GIF files) collect and store information about your visits to Web  sites, such as page visits, the duration of the visit, the specific  link(s) that you clicked during your visit, and the address of the  website from which you arrived at a Site.&nbsp; The information collected by  such tracking pixels is used in aggregate only for reporting purposes  and is not used in connection with your personally identifiable  information.&nbsp; Many web browsers are automatically set to accept  cookies.&nbsp; You may change your browser settings to either reject cookies  or notify you when a cookie is about to be placed on your computer.&nbsp;  Similarly, you may refer to the “help” portion on the toolbar for  detailed instructions on enabling and disabling tracking pixels.&nbsp;  Please note, however, that if you prevent the setting of cookies or  prevent the collection of automatic non-personally identifiable  information, you may not be able to access portions of a Site.</p>
    <p><strong>How the Information is Used</strong><br>
    We may use personally identifiable information about you to contact you  and to provide products and services to you, at your request.&nbsp; We may  use it to communicate with you through periodic messages regarding  services, events, and other information and notices we believe you may  find interesting or useful.&nbsp; We may use it for confirmation of  subscriptions or other actions you take on a Site, to send newsletters,  and for related customer service needs.&nbsp; Your credit card information  may be used by our financial services providers only for payment  processing and fraud prevention.</p>
    <p>We use the automatic non-personally identifiable information  collected to maintain, secure and improve each Site, and understand  your interests when visiting a Site.&nbsp; We do not collect any personally  identifiable information via a user’s IP address.</p>
    <p><strong>How the Information is Disclosed</strong><br>
      Blue Frog Gaming relies on various service providers and other contractors to  support its operations and each Site.&nbsp; We may share personally  identifiable information collected with these third parties, including  without limitation: contractors, who maintain our database, send emails  and/or newsletters on our behalf, or process our customers’ payments;  website hosting or information technology consulting services; website  management; data analysis; auditors; lawyers; investors; and other  administrative, back-up and security services.&nbsp; These third parties  will not utilize your information for any purpose but to provide the  services which we contract for.&nbsp; We may share aggregate information  about Site usage and traffic patterns, stripped of any personally  identifiable information, with third parties to comply with various  reporting obligations and for business or marketing purposes.</p>
    <p>If you choose to post information about yourself, including  personally identifiable information, through a Site’s services (for  example, your profile page, wall postings, forums, message boards, or  chat functionality), such information will be accessible to other Site  users.&nbsp; WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF ANY INFORMATION  YOU DISCLOSE THROUGH A SITE’S SERVICES.&nbsp; We do not sell, rent, exchange  or otherwise share our email lists and any personally identifiable  information about you with any third parties outside of Blue Frog Gaming for their  direct marketing purposes.</p>
    <p>Blue Frog Gaming also may disclose personally identifiable information in order  to:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;comply with applicable laws; (2)&nbsp;respond to governmental  inquiries or requests; (3)&nbsp;comply with a valid legal process;  (4)&nbsp;protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Blue Frog Gaming and its  employees and third parties on its properties, Site visitors, or the  public; (5)&nbsp;respond to an emergency; (6)&nbsp;enforce our Terms of Use; and  (7)&nbsp;permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we  may sustain.</p>
    <p>In the event there is a change in the corporate structure of Blue Frog Gaming,  including, without limitation, through merger, consolidation, sale,  liquidation or transfer of substantial assets, Blue Frog Gaming may, in its sole  and absolute discretion, transfer, sell or assign information collected  on and through a Site, including, without limitation, personally  identifiable information concerning Site users, to one or more  affiliated or unaffiliated third parties.</p>
    <p><strong>Opting-out from Our Email List; Changing or Deleting Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
      If you no longer wish to receive our email newsletter or other future  communications from us, please follow the opt-out instructions included  in each subscription communication or notify us by email at <a href="mailto:support@bluefroggaming.com" title="Linkification: mailto:optout@hive7.com">support@bluefroggaming.com</a> with the word “remove” in the subject header, and we will remove your  name from our email recipient list.&nbsp; These opt-out options do not apply  to communications that facilitate an agreed-upon transaction or update  you on our existing business relationship (for example, administrating  order completion, support, or other transactional or relationship  messages).&nbsp; Further, you may view, update, or remove from our database,  personally identifiable information you have given us by contacting us  by electronic mail or postal mail at the addresses provided at the end  of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Please note that we may need to retain certain  information for record keeping purposes, and there may also be residual  information that will remain within and will not be removed from our  databases and other records.&nbsp; We are not responsible for removing  information from the databases of third parties with whom we have  already shared your information.</p>
    <p><strong>Keeping Your Information Secure</strong><br>
    We seek to adopt commercially reasonable security measures consistent  with industry practice to ensure the security of personally  identifiable information in our possession and to protect it from  unauthorized access.&nbsp; Your credit card information is not stored on our  servers.&nbsp; Although we  make good faith efforts to store personally identifiable information in  a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, no  system transmitting data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%  secure, and we, therefore, cannot guarantee complete security.&nbsp; If you  have reasons to believe that your interaction with us is no longer  secure, please notify us of the problem by contacting us as explained  at the bottom this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Users Under 13 Years of Age</strong><br>
    Each Site is not directed towards users under the age of 13 and we do  not knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from  users under the age of 13.</p>
    <p><strong>Links</strong><br>
      On a Site, we may provide links to websites maintained by third parties  (such as our partners), which may provide certain related services or  which we believe you will find useful.&nbsp; Blue Frog Gaming is not responsible for  the privacy practices of these other websites.&nbsp; Therefore, the privacy  policies of such third-party websites may differ from those applicable  to a Site and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of each  of those other websites.&nbsp; We make no representation with regard to the  policies or business practices of any websites to which you connect  through a link from a Site, and are not responsible for any material  contained on, or any transactions that occur between you and, any such  website.</p>
    <p><strong>Location</strong><br>
    We host and maintain all Sites in the United States.&nbsp; By providing  personally identifiable information and other information to a Site,  you understand and consent to the collection, use, processing and  transfer of such information to the United States and other countries  or territories, which may not offer the same level of data protection  as the country where you reside, in accordance with the terms of this  Privacy Policy.</p>
