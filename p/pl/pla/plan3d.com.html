    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>How We Safeguard Your Privacy</h2>
    
        <p align="justify" class="bodyTextNoIndent">Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, 
          we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and 
          the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and 
          used. <br>
                  <br>
        </p>
    <hr>
        <h3><br>
          Privacy Policy - Plain English</h3>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText">WE SECURE YOUR INFORMATION CAREFULLY<br>
        The first thing we do to safeguard your information is to carefully protect our systems. We use every  means at our disposal to safeguard our servers from hackers and outsiders. This includes but is not limited to 128 bit SSL encryption of all data transmitted, hourly anti-hacker software scans, hourly anti-spam, anti-malware scans of our servers, and state-of-the-art  hardware and  software firewalls to deny hackers access to our servers and database every second. We are constantly diligent in this regard.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText">WE DON'T SHARE  INFORMATION UNLESS REQUIRED<br>
        We never share your personal information with anyone unless they are  part of the order taking or accounting process and have a need to know as part of our business arrangements with them (such as Visa, PayPal, etc.). None of these entities are ever given permission to contact you or share this information.<br>
      </p>
  <p align="justify" class="bodyText">WE DON'T STORE YOUR INFORMATION ON OUR SERVERS <br>
    We do not store your  payment data on our servers, except for a short period during the transaction process, such as credit card  or other payment data, to more securely protect you from hackers. All payment information is erased from our system after ordering is complete. We believe this  helps thwart  a determined genius hacker from accessing your personal payment information. They will find it more difficult to  find credit card or other payment information if they do manage to get access to our servers  - although the might be able to access your name, address, plan3D user name, plan3D password, and email information if they break into our database. For that reason we recommend you do not use the same password  you use with banks or other entities where security is very important. As of this date we have never been hacked into - but if Sony and other mega-billion dollar companies can be hacked into as reported in national news services recently, we suppose any web site could be hacked in if the attacker were smart or persistent enough.<br>

        requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your 
        inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs

        information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is 
        inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, 
        for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking 
        the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves 
        for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText">Finally, Plan3D sites will not use or transfer personally identifiable

      <h3><a name="3" id="3"></a>Collection of Information by Third Party Sites</h3>
      <p align="justify" class="bodyText">Plan3D sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are 
        sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third parties. By virtue 
        of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable 
        information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, 
        sweepstakes, or promotion. Plan3D has no control over the third-party
