<div class="secondary_copy"><h2>SiteLife Privacy Policy</h2><br>
  <p>Pluck is committed to protecting your privacy and respects the  privacy of individuals who use Pluck's software and services. This  Privacy Statement covers how Pluck treats personal information that is  either collected or received. This includes, but is not limited to  email addresses, phone numbers, names, addresses, age, gender, and  interests.</p>

  <p>Pluck's SiteLife product provides a white-label  solution used by Pluck's customers ("Customers") to implement social  networking communities. Each of Pluck's Customers determine how to  provide the Pluck functionality to end-users. In this arrangement  Pluck's Customers have final control on what information is collected  and the end-user's ability to opt-out/opt-in of the information  gathering process. When registering with one of Pluck's Customers'  websites, some or all of the information gathered from end-users may be  stored by Pluck. All information collected by Pluck Customers is  governed by such Customer's privacy policy. Any information provided to  Pluck by the Customer, or collected by Pluck as a result of Customer's  configuration of the Pluck Services, will be governed by this Privacy  Policy.</p>

  <p>Because protecting your privacy is important to Pluck, we adhere to  the Safe Harbor Agreement concerning the transfer of personal data from  the European Union ("EU") to the United States of America. Accordingly,  we follow the Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department  of Commerce ("Principles") with respect to all data that we receive,  whether directly from the end user or from one of our Customers. If  there is any conflict between the policies in this statement and the  Principles, the Principles will govern. This statement outlines our  general policy and practices for implementing the Principles, including  the types of information we receive, how we use it, and the choices  affected individuals have regarding our use of, and their ability to  correct, that information.</p>
  
  <p>This privacy statement applies to all personal information we  receive (except as noted below). For purposes of this privacy  statement, "personal information" means information that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>is transferred from the EU to the United States;</li>
     <li>is recorded in any form;</li>
     <li>is about, or pertains to, a specific individual; and </li>
     <li>can be linked to that individual.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It does not include information that pertains to a specific  individual, but from which that individual could not reasonably be  identified.</p>
  <h3>Principles Protecting Individuals' Privacy</h3>
  <p><strong>Notice and Choice</strong><br>
    Because the Customer determines what personal information is collected,  end users should review the Customer privacy policy to determine the  types of personal information collected from them, the purposes for  which such information is collected and used, and the types of  non-agent third parties to whom the personal information is disclosed.  The Customer should also be consulted regarding the choices and means,  if any, offered to individuals for limiting the use or disclosure of  their information. Customers' privacy policies will govern their  collection and disclosure of any such information. Pluck stores all  personal information solely for use by Customers and end users related  to their use of Pluck services. </p>

  <p><strong>Disclosures and Transfers</strong><br>
    Pluck will not  disclose an individual's personal information to third parties, except  when one or more of the following conditions is true: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Our Customer that provided the information to us asks for us  to transfer it back to them for whatever purpose the Customer chooses;</li>
    <li>We have the individual's permission to make the disclosure, whether  such permission is made directly to Pluck or to our Customer; </li>
     <li>The disclosure is required by law or professional standards; </li>
     <li>The disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or disposition of all or part of our business; </li>
     <li>The information in question is publicly available; </li>
      <li>The disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment or defense of legal claims; or </li>
      <li>The disclosure is to another Pluck entity or to persons or entities  providing services on our or the individual's behalf (each a  "transferee"), consistent with the purpose for which the information  was obtained, if the transferee, with respect to the information in  question:</li>
  <ul>
   <li>is subject to law providing an adequate level of privacy protection; </li>
  <li>has agreed in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection; or </li>
  <li>subscribes to the Principles. </li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
  <p>Permitted transfers of information, either to third parties or  within Pluck, include the transfer of data from one jurisdiction to  another, including transfers to and from the United States of America.  Because privacy laws vary from one jurisdiction to another, personal  information may be transferred to a jurisdiction where the laws provide  less or different protection than the jurisdiction in which the  information originated. Notwithstanding, Pluck may share aggregate data  with 3rd parties per our agreement with the Pluck Customer. This  information will not identify the related end-user.</p>
 
  <p><strong>Data Security</strong><br>
    Pluck takes your security seriously and takes reasonable steps to  protect your information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure,  maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use and  confidentiality of information, either for its own purposes or on  behalf of our clients, Pluck has put in place appropriate physical,  electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the  information we process. However, we cannot guarantee the security of  information on or transmitted via the Internet or stored by our  Customers.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Data Integrity</strong><br>
    We process personal information only in ways compatible with the  purpose for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the  individual. To the extent necessary for such purposes, we take  reasonable steps to make sure that personal information is accurate,  complete, current, and otherwise reliable with regard to its intended  use.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Access and Correction</strong><br>
    An end-users' ability to manage the data stored by Pluck is controlled  by Pluck's Customers. However, if an individual becomes aware that  information we maintain about that individual is inaccurate, or if an  individual would like to update or review his or her information, the  individual may contact us using the contact information below and we  will take reasonable steps to work with our Customer to correct the  problem. The individual will need to provide sufficient identifying  information, and we may request additional identifying information as a  security precaution. In addition, we may limit or deny access to  personal information where providing such access would be unreasonably  burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted  by the Safe Harbor Agreement. In some circumstances, we may charge a  reasonable fee, where warranted, for access to personal information.</p>
 
  <p><strong>Enforcement and Dispute Resolution</strong><br>
    Pluck utilizes the self-assessment approach to assure its compliance  with our privacy statement. Pluck periodically verifies that the policy  is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered,  prominently displayed, completely implemented, and in conformity with  the Principles. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns  with us using the contact information below. We will investigate and  attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure  of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in  this policy.<br>
  <br>
    If you would like to speak to someone at Pluck about your information,  or if you have a concern about information we have collected or stored,  please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@pluck.com">privacy@pluck.com</a>. We will do our best to respond to you in a timely and professional manner to answer your questions and resolve your concerns.<br>
  <br>
    In the unfortunate and unlikely event that we cannot resolve your  concerns, we have contracted with BBBOnline as a dispute resolution  provider. You can contact the BBBOnline at <a href="http://www.bbbonline.org/consumer/complaint.asp">http://www.bbbonline.org/consumer/complaint.asp</a> and follow their guidelines for initiating their dispute resolution procedures.</p>

  This privacy statement may be changed from time to time, consistent  with the requirements of the Safe Harbor. We will post any revised  policy on this Web site, or a similar Web site that replaces this Web  site.

  <em>Pluck reserves the right to modify all or some of this privacy statement at any time without notice.</em><br><br>
