<p><strong>3. Cookies<br></strong>We use 'cookies' in order to recognise you when you come back to our website. This helps us to improve the content of our website and provide services that are tailored to your user experience. Cookies are small text files that are stored by your browser on your hard drive, retaining information about you and enabling our website to recognise you on repeat visits. The cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you personally. If you do not want a cookie to be stored in your computer, the Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to erase cookies from your computer's hard drive or how to block cookies or to receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You are therefore welcome to use such facilities to prevent the installation of any cookie.</p>
<p><strong>4. Data Disclosure<br></strong>4.1 We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties except with your permission or as required by law (for example by a search warrant, subpoena or other legal process).</p>
<p>4.2 Plumbase may in future use a data services company to analyse data on our behalf, so that we can provide you with more targeted and bespoke communications. We will only use such companies if they are registered under the Data Protection Act 1998 and provided that their procedures for ensuring the privacy of your personal information are at least as rigorous as our own.</p>
<p><strong>5. User access</strong><br>You are entitled to ask us at any time for a copy of the information we hold on you and you may correct it if you wish (we may charge a small fee not exceeding Â£10.00).

If at any time you want to withdraw your consent to our use of your personal information, please write to us at the above address.</p>
<p><strong>6. Data Security<br></strong>The security of your personal information is important to us. We and Bellman have implemented measures designed to protect the personal information under our control (including security measures to protect our user database) from unauthorised access, improper use, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction and accidental loss. We will store your information on our database for only so long as is reasonably necessary. We will not transfer any information that we hold on you to anyone outside the European Economic Area. By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this policy. If this policy changes in any way, we will place an updated version on our website. You should regularly review our website to check you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we will share it with other parties.</p>
<p><strong>7. Other Websites</strong><br>Our website contains links to other websites which Plumbase does not operate or control. This Privacy Policy only covers websites that Plumbase controls, and we cannot therefore accept responsibility for the use of your personal information by the operator of any other site that we may link or refer to and which you visit.
