      conditions of use. You may view these terms and conditions on our website.</p>
    <p><strong>THE TYPE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</strong></p>
    <p>Like most places on the Internet, simply by visiting our website you
      automatically tell us certain information. This includes basic information
      such as your IP address, when you visited, the website from where you came
      prior to visiting us, the website where you go when you leave our website,
      your computer's operating system, and the type of web browser that you are
      using. Our website automatically records this basic information about you.</p>
    <p>And like many other websites, we may use cookies. In plain English, this
      means information that our website's server transfers to your computer.
      This information can be used to track your session on our website. Cookies
      may also be used to customize our website content for you as an
      individual. If you are using one of the common Internet web browsers, you
      can set up your browser to either let you know when you receive a cookie
      or to deny cookie access to your computer.</p>
    <p>We may also collect any data that you provide us by e-mail. This may
      include, but not limited to, your name and email address. You can always
      choose not to provide us with information. However, if you do withhold
      information, we may deny you access to some or all of our website's
      services and features.</p>
    <p>The use of cookies by our [partners, affiliates, tracking utility
      company, service providers] is/is not covered by our privacy policy.&nbsp; We

      and enforce our website's terms and conditions.</p>
    <p>As a general rule, we will not give your data to third parties without
      your permission. However, there are some important exceptions to this rule
      that are described in the following paragraphs.</p>
    <p>We may, in our sole discretion, provide information about you to law
      enforcement or other government officials for purposes of fraud
      investigations, alleged intellectual property infringement, or any other
      suspected illegal activity or matters that may expose us to legal
      liability. If Plug-In Profit Site is involved in a merger, acquisition, or
      sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email
      and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or
      uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have
      regarding your personal information.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Although we do not disclose individually identifiable information, we may
      disclose aggregate data about our website's visitors to advertisers or
      other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.</p>
    <p>From time to time, we may use third party suppliers to provide services
      on our website. If a supplier wants to collect information about you, you
      will be notified. However, you will never be required to give information
      to a third party supplier. We restrict the way third party suppliers can
      use your information. They are not allowed to sell or give your
      information to others.</p>

      completely and re-open it before viewing other parts of the Internet.</p>
