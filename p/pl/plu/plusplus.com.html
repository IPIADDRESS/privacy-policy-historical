<p><i>Last Updated: June 1, 2010 </i> </p>
<p><i>"We have updated
the ngmoco Privacy Policy as of June 1, 2010 and described our practices
regarding data sharing with Preferred Partners and compliance with California's
"Shine the Light" Law."</i>  </p>
<p align="center"><b>ngmoco:) Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p>Your privacy is a priority
at ngmoco, and the aim of our Privacy Policy is to help you make informed
decisions about how you interact with ngmoco products, services, and
marketing communications.</p>
<p>As used in this Privacy
Policy, "<b><i>ngmoco</i></b>", "<b><i>we</i></b>" or "<b><i>our</i></b>"
refers to ngmoco, Inc. and its subsidiaries,
separately or together, including, but not limited to, entities such
as Miraphonic. This Privacy Policy applies only to the
collection, use and disclosure of personal information that you may
decide to provide to ngmoco in your use of (i) our applications for the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and all platforms
or devices that are based on or embed current and future versions of
Apple's operating system for these platforms or devices (collectively
"<b>iPhone OS</b>") and our web applications accessible
on third party social networking services ("<b>SNS</b>")
("ngmoco Applications"), (ii) our game publisher
network, crowd sourcing service and interactive platform ("<b>Plus+
network</b>") provided in connection with ngmoco Applications,
(iii) the <a href="http://ngmoco.com" target="_blank">ngmoco.com</a> domain and its sub domains
and (iv) any other websites owned or controlled by ngmoco ("<b>Sites</b>"),
any and all of the foregoing the "<b>Services</b>". </p>
<p>We reserve the right to
update our Privacy Policy at any time. If we modify this Privacy Policy
in a material way, a notice will be posted in our Services, and on the
Sites along with the updated Privacy Policy. We will also update the
"Last Updated Date" in the Privacy Policy.  By continuing to
access or use the Services after we have posted an updated Privacy Policy
or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating
that you agree to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.  If
the modified Privacy Policy is not acceptable to you, your only recourse
is to cease using the Services. Please visit this page periodically
to remain up-to-date as to any changes. Please take a moment to read
the following to learn about our information collection
practices that may impact you as a registered
user with full access to our Services
("<b>Full Account</b>"), a user of a Limited Account
(defined below), or a non-registered user of our Services
(each a "<b>ngmoco User</b>"). For information regarding the collection
and use of Personal Information (defined below) from children under
14 years old, see the Section below, entitled "<b>Our Policy Toward
Children</b>".</p>
<p><b>Why We Collect Personal
Information</b></p>
<p>We may collect information
about you through your use of the Services to provide you with a superior
and personally relevant user experience. The information we collect
can be personal or non-personal in nature, and may be used alone or
in the aggregate with that of other ngmoco Users. Your Personal Information
(defined below), for instance, may be used in some cases to recommend
products of interest directly to you, and in other cases for market
research purposes that support our efforts to deliver a more valuable
service to our community of users. For example, we may use your Personal
Information to contact you with announcements, newsletters and promotional
materials related to our Services or to offer you opportunities to participate
in surveys, contests or sweepstakes (any of these a "<b>Promotion</b>")
via our Services. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish
to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe
instructions provided in any of the communications. (See "<b>Changing
or Removing Information</b>" below for further information.)</p>
<p><b>What Information We
Collect</b></p>
<p>In the course of using
the Services, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable
information that can be used to contact or identify you; personally
identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name,
phone number, photo representation ("avatar"),
email address and mailing address ("<b>Personal Information</b>").
We collect your Personal Information in connection with your registration
to join our Services. You can register to join either via an ngmoco
Applications or an iPhone OS application created by a Third Party Publisher.
"<b>Third Party Publisher</b>" means a third party that has developed
its own iPhone OS application that is connected to our Services. (See
"<b>When We Disclose Information</b>" below for further
information regarding our sharing of specific subsets of the information
we collect from you). </p>
<p>Other instances when Personal
Information may be collected via our Services include the following:</p>
<ul type="DISC">
<li>If you, as
a user with a Full Account,
choose to link your ngmoco account to an SNS: Personal Information you
independently submit to an SNS like Facebook may be collected and used
by us in order to provide you with enhanced functionality. In these
instances, you consent to ngmoco's access and use of your username,
alias and any other Personal Information you have independently provided
to and made accessible through the SNS. Such access will be in accordance
with the privacy settings you have set in your SNS account, if any. </li>
<li>If you choose
to participate in a Promotion: We may request that you provide us with
Personal Information like your email address or mailing address in order
to administer your participation in the Promotion. </li>
</ul>
<p>We also collect other
information that you may provide as part of registration and the administration
and personalization of your user experience (e.g., without limitation,
zip code, geolocation and user preferences) ("<b>Non-Identifying Information</b>").
Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your
Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (e.g.,
combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables
you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered
Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only
with other non-identifying information (e.g., your viewing preferences).</p>
<p>When you launch any of
our ngmoco Applications or register to join our Services via an iPhone
OS application created by a Third Party Publisher, we collect your device
type, the unique device ID issued by Apple for your iPhone OS ("<b>Device
ID</b>") and IP address, if applicable. We use the Device ID to make
it possible to authenticate and understand use of our Services, or the
third party services that an ngmoco User may choose to access through
them. Related to this information collection, our Services may serve
ads that contain links to other iPhone OS applications connected to
our Services, and your Device ID enables us to track any clicks you
may choose to make. Our use of your Device ID does not enable us to
identify you personally, and we do not store this information in connection
with your ngmoco User account information. </p>
<p><b>Cookies &amp; Other
Technologies</b></p>
<p>As is standard practice
on many websites, ngmoco's Sites use "cookies" to help us study
traffic patterns on our Sites and understand the effectiveness of our
marketing communications. A cookie is a small string of text that a
website can send to your browser. Other types of cookies exist, but
the cookies we use in connection with our Services can only identify
your browser and cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive,
pass on computer viruses, or capture your email address. Cookies can
reveal, for instance, which pages on the Sites are the most popular,
how much time visitors are spending there, and how they are interacting
with the content on these pages. You have the option to disable cookies
by changing the options in your browser to stop accepting cookies or
to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to view or
use all portions of the Sites due to limited functionality.</p>
<p>Some of our email messages
use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the Sites. We track
this click-through data to help us determine interest in topics. If
you prefer not to be tracked by us in this way, do not click on our
click-through URLs. </p>
<p>We may
also use "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar
means (individually or collectively "<b><i>Pixel Tags</i></b>")
in connection with our Services and to collect usage, demographic and
geographical location data.  A Pixel Tag is an electronic image,
often a single pixel that is ordinarily not visible to users and may
be associated with cookies on a user's hard drive. Pixel Tags allow
us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Sites, to deliver
branded services and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional
or advertising campaigns.  </p>
<p>When you use our Services
(e.g., when you visit our Sites or interact with one of our ngmoco Applications
connected to our Sites, our servers automatically record information
that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or service connected
to the Internet ("<b>Log Data</b>"). This Log Data may include information
such as your computer's or mobile device's Internet Protocol ("<b>IP</b>")
address, browser type, the webpage you were visiting before you came
to our Sites, pages of our Sites that you visit, the time spent on those
pages, information you search for on our Sites, access times and dates,
and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze
use of the Services for technical administration and tailoring our Services
to our visitors' needs. </p>
<p><b>When We Disclose Your
Information</b></p>
<p><i>Within the ngmoco Services</i>
As a user with a Full Account, you may
create your own profile, connect with other users of the Services, send
messages and transmit information through various channels. Please remember
that any communications you have via the Services, depending on, for
example, the functionality of the ngmoco Application or an iPhone OS
application created by a Third Party Publisher connected to our Services,
may reveal your screen name, and the content of your communications
making this information publicly available to other ngmoco Users. ngmoco
is not responsible for the activities of other ngmoco Users or other
third parties with whom you choose to provide your Personal Information
or otherwise.</p>
<p><i>With Third
Parties for Industry Analysis </i>
We may share aggregated information that includes Non-Identifying Information
with Third Party Publishers and advertisers and ad networks
("<b>Advertising Entities</b>") with whom we have
a strategic relationship. The information shared with these third parties
may be used to support user trend analyses and demographic profiling
but will not contain your Personal Information. Some Third Party Publishers
and Advertising Entities also act as
Service Providers (defined below) to us, so in those
cases we will share your information as described below. </p>
<p><i>With Preferred Partners</i></p>
<p>We may share your username,
email address and Device ID ("<b>Specific Shared Data</b>") with
certain of our preferred Third Party Publishers and partners ( "<b>Preferred</b> <b>
Partners</b>") for those parties to assist us with providing you with
the aspect of the Services for which you provided such Specific Shared
Data to us, and to use such Specific Shared Data to provide you with
information and marketing materials about their own applications, products
and services, for example, to further enhance your use of our Services
and to augment your gaming and social networking experience generally.
We only share Specific Shared Data with our preferred Third Party Publishers
pursuant to an agreement under which the Third Party Publisher is obligated
to use such data solely for such purposes. Some Preferred Partners also
act as Service Providers (defined below) to us, so in those cases we
will also share your Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information
as described below.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Privacy Policy, we only share Specific Shared Data with our Preferred
Partners pursuant to an agreement under which the Preferred Partner
is obligated to use and disclose Specific Shared Data in compliance
with applicable law.</p>
<p><i>With
Third Party Social Networking Services</i>
As a user with a Full Account,
you may link your ngmoco account information with certain SNSs where
other ngmoco Users have an existing account with the
SNS. In these instances, with your permission and on your behalf, we
will share your email address and screen name or alias with the applicable
SNS. Through use of such services' APIs, as stated above, we also
receive certain information (which may include your personal information)
in accordance with the privacy settings you have set in your SNS account,
if any. Other than what we may share with the SNS in connection with
your linking of accounts, the personal information an SNS has about
you is obtained by the SNS independent of our Services. Other services
follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal
information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy
policies or statements of the other services you use. </p>
<p><i>With our Service Providers </i>
Disclosure of your Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information
may also occur where we engage or employ
service providers, vendors or other third
party entities to facilitate provision
of our Services (each a "<b>Service
Provider</b>") (e.g., without limitation, improvement
of our Services' features, user account authentication,
promotion and marketing, administration,
virtual currency transactions, crowd-sourcing
and related services), to provide the Services on our
behalf, or to assist us in analyzing how our Services
are being used. Our Service Providers may have access
to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf
and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
<p><i>Under Special Circumstances</i>
At times, we may disclose information about you to law enforcement officials
or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary
or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but
not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of ngmoco
or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person
or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be or to pose a risk
of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
<p>Under another special
set of circumstances, for example, in connection with a merger, acquisition,
reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy, we
may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of ngmoco assets,
including your Personal Information.</p>
<p><b>Our Policy Toward Children </b></p>
<p>We are committed to compliance
with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("<b>COPPA</b>").
Consequently, we do not collect Personal Information from children under
age 14 ("<b>child</b>" or "<b>children</b>") in a manner inconsistent
with COPPA and we have developed an anonymous user experience that delivers
a limited version of our products and services for children, as described
below.  </p>
<p><i>Creation of a "Limited Account" - Email Address Anonymization.</i>  </p>
<p>When a ngmoco User chooses
to register to join our Services, the ngmoco User is asked to select
a user name and password.  In order to determine who is younger
than 14 years old, we ask the ngmoco User to select his or her age from
a set of age ranges at the start of the registration process.
If the ngmoco User indicates that he/she is a child, we collect and/or
process the information provided by the child to create a Limited Account.
A "<b>Limited Account</b>" is a ngmoco account where the ngmoco
User can enjoy a limited version of our Services, but cannot disclose
Personal Information about themselves via our Services. When a ngmoco
User indicates that he/she is under age 14 and attempts to register
with our Services we ask that ngmoco User to provide two pieces of information:
(i) his/her first name only; and (ii) his/her email address.  The
email address is collected for the sole purpose of providing email reminders
for password resets to the ngmoco User once he or she completes registration
for a Limited Account.   When the email address is provided
by the ngmoco User, our system immediately alters the email address
by "hashing" the email address and assigns that data an anonymous
ID number such that the email address cannot be reconstructed by us
into its original form, but the "hashed" form can be used for our
password reminder system.  This process reflects guidance provided
by the Federal Trade Commission ("<b>FTC</b>"). For more information
on COPPA and the FTC's compliance recommendations you can visit
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/<wbr>coppafaqs.shtm</a>.  </p>
<p>Our practices regarding
collection of Non-Identifying Information, including Device IDs, and
our practices regarding use of Cookies and Other Technology and Log
Data described above in this Privacy Policy, apply to all ngmoco Users
including children who hold a Limited Account.  </p>
<p><b>Invite-A-Friend</b></p>
<p>If you choose to use our
referral services to tell a friend about our Services, we will ask you
for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send
your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to use an aspect of
our Services. ngmoco hashes these email addresses after using them for
the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. </p>
<p><b>Emailing Via a ngmoco Application</b></p>
<p>ngmoco Users may send
pre-formatted messages through use of their personal email account connected
to their iPhone OS device to, for example, challenge their friends to
beat their high score in an ngmoco Application where this functionality
is available. ngmoco does not store the email address of the friend
you choose to email. The message you initiate will be sent through your
personal email account to the email addresses you choose.</p>
<p><b>How We Protect Your
Personal Information</b></p>
<p>ngmoco takes your privacy
very seriously and employs administrative, physical and electronic measures
to safeguard your information from identity theft and unauthorized access.
We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information,
your account ID, login password or national identification numbers in
a non-secure or unsolicited communication (e.g. via e-mail, telephone,
iPhone OS device).</p>
<p>We will make any legally
required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality,
or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data"
(as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification)
to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Sites in the most expedient
time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent
with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures
necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable
integrity of the data system.</p>
<p><b>Changing or Removing
Information</b></p>
<p>As a user of a Full Account, your may update or delete the Personal
Information in your profile by logging into your account. You may also
email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ngmoco.com" target="_blank">privacy@ngmoco.com</a> to request that we delete your Personal
Information from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts
to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records
as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
Specific Shared Data cannot be retrieved from Preferred Partners after
its disclosure. </p>
<p>Where you share information
with other users through the communication channels of our Services,
you generally cannot remove such communications.</p>
<p>If you participate in
a Promotion hosted by us (where you may
or may not disclose the information requested), you have the option
to opt out at any time from such participation and the receipt of any
related communications. Please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided
in the relevant communications.</p>
<p>If your friend received
an invitation from ngmoco per your referral to try the Services, your
friend may request that the name and email address used in the invitation
be removed from ngmoco's records. We store this information for the
sole purposes of measuring the effectiveness of our referral program
and sending the email you initiated, but your friend can request to
have it removed from our database by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ngmoco.com" target="_blank">privacy@ngmoco.com</a>.</p>
<p><b>Links to Other Websites and Services </b></p>
<p>Our Services may contain links to other websites and online services or offers
from third parties. For example, our Services may include offers from
third party advertisers or the ability to engage in transactions with
such entities. Users of Limited Accounts are not provided access to
offers made my third party advertisers requesting Personal Information
via our services. If you, as a user of a Full Account, choose to participate
in offer-linked information requests or you "click on" an advertisement<s><strike>,</strike></s>
or another third party link, you may be directed to that third party's
website or service and/or be prompted to provide your
Personal Information in connection with such activity.
The fact that we link to a third party website or service is not an
endorsement or representation of our affiliation with that third party,
nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies
or practices or their compliance with laws.
We do not exercise control over third party websites or services.
These other websites or services may place their own cookies or other
files on your computer or mobile devices, collect data or solicit personal
information from you. Other websites and services follow different rules
regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit
to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements
of the other websites and services you use and the terms
of the offers in which you participate. You agree that ngmoco is not
responsible for nor will it be liable to you or any third party for
your interaction with such third parties or
the information requests initiated by such third parties
or the subsequent use, treatment or dissemination
of the information you voluntarily choose to provide to them.</p>
<p><b>International Users</b></p>
<p>If you are located outside
the United States and choose to provide information to ngmoco, we transfer
Personal Information to and process it in the United States. Your consent
to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of Personal Information
represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
<p><b>Your California Privacy Rights</b>
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of ngmoco who
are California residents to request certain information regarding our
disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct
marketing purposes.  If you are a California resident and have
provided ngmoco with personal information within the last year, you
may make such a request by emailing us at the following email address
with the email's subject titled as "California Privacy Rights":
<a href="mailto:privacy@ngmoco.com" target="_blank">privacy@ngmoco.com</a>. </p>
<p>Within 30 days of receiving
such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of personal
information disclosed to third parties for such third parties' direct
marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along
with the names and addresses of these third parties. A request may be
made no more than once per calendar year and we are not required to
respond to requests made by means other than through the email address
above.</p>
