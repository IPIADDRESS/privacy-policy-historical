<p align="center"><strong>ngmoco:) Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>As used in this Privacy Policy, “ngmoco”, “we”, “us”, or “our” refer to ngmoco, LLC, and all of its  subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Your privacy is important to ngmoco.
We designed our Privacy Policy to cover how we collect, use, disclose,
transfer and store your information.  Please familiarize yourself
with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy applies only to the
collection, use and disclosure of personal information that you may
decide to provide to us in your use of: (i) our applications for mobile
platforms or devices and our web applications accessible on third party
social networking services (“<b>SNS</b>”) (collectively, our mobile

(ii) our game publisher networks, crowd sourcing service and interactive
platforms (“<b>Networks</b>”) provided in connection with ngmoco
Applications, (iii) our portal for third-party game developers (“<b>mobage
Developer Portal</b>”) provided in connection with Third-Party Mobile
Applications (defined below), (iv) our web domains and subdomains, including

and web forums or messaging boards in ngmoco Applications and our Sites
(collectively, our “<b>Forums</b>”).  Any and all of our ngmoco
Applications, Networks, mobage Developer Portal, Sites and Forums are
referred to herein as our “<b>Services</b>”.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to update this Privacy
Policy at any time. If we modify this Privacy Policy in a material way,
a notice will be posted in our Services and on the Sites along with
the updated Privacy Policy. We will also update the “Last Updated
Date” in the Privacy Policy. By continuing to access or use the Services
after we have posted an updated Privacy Policy or have provided you
with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to
be bound by the modified Privacy Policy. If the modified Privacy Policy
is not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Services.</p>
<p>Please visit this page periodically to
remain up-to-date as to any Privacy Policy changes. Take a moment now
to read the following to learn about our information collection practices
that may impact you as a registered user with full access to our Services
(“<b>Full Account</b>”), a user of a Limited Account (defined below),
or a non-registered user of our Services (each a “<b>ngmoco User</b>”).
For information regarding the collection and use of Personal Information
(defined below) from children under 14 years old, see the Section below,
entitled “Our Policy Toward Children”.</p>
<p><b>We Collect Personal Information and
Non-Identifying Information</b></p>
<p>In the course of using our Services,
we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information
that can be used to contact or identify you.  Personally identifiable
information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number,
photo representation (“<b>avatar</b>”), email address and mailing
address (“<b>Personal Information</b>”).  We will collect,
use, transfer and disclose Personal Information in accordance with our
Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We also collect non-personal information,
which is data in a form that does not permit direct association with
you or any specific individual (“<b>Non-Identifying Information</b>”).
We may collect, use, transfer and disclose Non-Identifying Information
for any purpose; however, we provide details in this Privacy Policy
about what Non-Identifying Information we collect currently, and how
we use, transfer and disclose such Non-Identifying Information today.</p>
<p><b>Why We Collect Personal Information</b></p>
<p>The information that we collect can be
Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information, and may be used
alone or in the aggregate with information collected from other ngmoco
Users. In addition to our collection of such information, you may be
asked explicitly to provide Personal Information or Non-Identifying
Information anytime that you are in contact with ngmoco or an ngmoco-affiliated
company.  If your Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information
is shared between our affiliates and us, such sharing will be in accordance
with this Privacy Policy. Our primary objective is to provide you with
a superior and personally relevant user experience.</p>
<p><b>How
we use your Personal Information</b></p>
<p>Your Personal Information may be used,
for instance:</p>
<ul type="DISC">
<li>To help us to develop, deliver,
and improve our Services and advertising;</li>
<li>To recommend products of interest
directly to you,</li>
<li>For market research purposes
that support our efforts to deliver a more valuable service to our community
of ngmoco Users;</li>
<ul type="DISC">
<li>For example, we may use your
Personal Information to contact you with announcements, newsletters
and promotional materials related to our Services or to offer you opportunities
to participate in surveys, contests or sweepstakes (any of these a “Promotion”)
via our Services.</li>
<ul type="DISC">
<li>If you decide at any time
that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please
follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.
(See “Changing or Removing Information” below for further information.)</li>
</ul></ul>
<li>To allow us to keep you posted
regarding our latest Service announcements, software updates, and upcoming
events;</li>
<li>To send important notices,
such as communications about your purchases and changes to our <a href="http://www.ngmoco.com/terms-of-use" target="_blank"><u>Terms of
Use</u></a>, this Privacy Policy,
or other Service-specific policies. Because this information is important
to your interactions with ngmoco, you may not opt out of receiving these
communications; and</li>
<li>To audit and analyze data
to improve our Services and customer communications.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What Information We Collect</b></p>
<p>One of the instances when we collect
your Personal Information is in connection with your registration to
join our Services.</p>
<ul type="DISC">
<li>If you are an ngmoco User,
you can register to join either via an ngmoco Application or via a third-party
application utilizing our Services (“<b>Third Party Application</b>”)
that was designed for mobile telephones or other mobile devices by a
third-party publisher (“<b>Third Party Publisher</b>”).</li>
<ul><ul type="DISC">
<li>In connection with registration
of ngmoco Users via our Services or via a Third-Party Mobile Application,
we collect Personal Information, which may include your email address,
device type, mobile carrier, unique mobile device identifier (“Device
ID”), Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and geo location, as applicable.</li>
<ul type="DISC">
<li>We use your Device ID to make
it possible to authenticate and understand your use of our Services,
or the Third Party Application that you may choose to access through
our Services.</li>
<li>Related to this information
collection, our Services may serve ads that contain links to other Third-Party
Mobile Applications, and we may utilize your Device ID to track clicks
or other ad fulfillment metrics.</li>
<li>Our use of your Device ID
does not enable us to identify you personally, and we do not store this
information in connection with your ngmoco User account information.</li>
<li>See “When We Disclose Information”
below for further information regarding our sharing of specific subsets
of the information we collect from you.</li>
</ul></ul>
<li>If you are a Third-Party Publisher,
you can register to develop Third Party Applications via our Sites.</li>
<ul type="DISC">
<li>In connection with registration
as a Third-Party Publisher, we may collect your name, mailing address,
email address and telephone number.</li>
<ul type="DISC">
<li>We collect this Personal Information
to ensure that we are able to contact you.</li>
</ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p>Other instances when Personal Information
may be collected via our Services include the following:</p>
<ul type="DISC">
<li>If you, as an ngmoco User
with a Full Account, choose to link your ngmoco account to an SNS:</li>
<ul type="DISC">
<li>Personal Information that
you independently submit to an SNS (e.g., Facebook) may be collected
and used by us in order to provide you with enhanced functionality.
In these instances, you consent to ngmoco’s access and use of your
username, alias and any other Personal Information you have independently
provided to and made accessible through the SNS. Such access will be
in accordance with the privacy settings you have set in your SNS account,
if any.</li>
<ul type="DISC">
<li>Similarly, we may use Personal
Information that you have provided to us to help you establish social
connections with other ngmoco Users.</li>
</ul></ul>
<li>If you choose to participate
in a Promotion:</li>
<ul type="DISC">
<li>We may request that you provide
us with Personal Information like your email address or mailing address
in order to administer your participation in the Promotion.</li>
</ul></ul>
<p>In connection with our Services or Third-Party
Mobile Applications, we may collect Non-Identifying Information such
as Device ID, device type, mobile carrier, platform version and geo-location.
In addition, we may collect navigation, interaction and engagement information
regarding ngmoco Users.  This Non-Identifying Information is aggregated
and used to help improve our Services and Third Party Mobile Applications
by providing a better way to understand the ngmoco User experience with
the level of interest in various portions of our Sites, specific ngmoco
Applications or specific Third-Party Mobile Applications.  </p>
<p>Certain Non-Identifying Information would
be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined
with other identifiers (e.g., combining your zip code with your street
address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces
of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they
are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying Information
(e.g., your viewing preferences).</p>
<p><b>Cookies &amp; Other Technologies</b></p>
<p>As is standard practice, we use “cookies”
to help us study traffic patterns and understand the effectiveness of
our marketing communications. A cookie is a small string of text that
we send to your computer’s or mobile device’s browser. Other types
of cookies exist, but the cookies we use in connection with our Services
are only used to obtain browser-specific information.  For example,
we do not use cookies to retrieve data from your hard drive, pass on
computer viruses, or capture your email address. Cookies we use can
reveal, for instance, which pages are the most popular, how much time
ngmoco Users are spending there, and how they are interacting with the
content on such pages.</p>
<p>You have the option to disable cookies
by changing the options in your browser to stop accepting cookies or
to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the pages you visit. If
you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to view or use
all portions of our Services due to limited functionality.</p>
<p>Some of our Services, including email
messaging, use “click-through URLs” linked to other content on our
Services. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest
in topics, Services usability and other measures of ngmoco User engagement.</p>
<p>We may also use “pixel tags,” “web
beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively
“<b>Pixel Tags</b>”) in connection with our Services and to collect
usage, demographic and geographical location data. A Pixel Tag is an
electronic image, often a single pixel that is ordinarily not visible
to users and may be associated with cookies on a user’s hard drive.
Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of
the Sites, to deliver branded services and to help determine the effectiveness
of promotional or advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>When you use our Services or Third-Party
Mobile Applications, our servers automatically record information that
your browser or the applicable Service or Third-Party Mobile Application
sends (“<b>Log Data</b>”). This Log Data may include information
such as your computer’s or mobile device’s IP address, browser type,
language, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring and exit pages,
time spent, information searched for, time and date stamp, clickstream
data and other statistics. We use this information to monitor, analyze
and understand trends, for technical administration of Services and
Third-Party Mobile Applications, and to gather demographic information
about our ngmoco User base as a whole.  We, and Third-Party Publishers
may use this information for product and services improvements, and
in marketing and advertising services.</p>
<p><b>When We Disclose Your Information
Within ngmoco Services </b></p>
<p>As a user with a Full Account, you may
create your own profile, connect with other ngmoco Users of Services,
send messages and transmit information through various channels. Please
remember that any communications you have via our Services, depending
on, for example, the functionality of any ngmoco Application or Third-Party
Mobile Application connected to our Services, may reveal your screen
name and the content of your communications, making this information
publicly available to other ngmoco Users. ngmoco is not responsible
for the activities of other ngmoco Users or other third parties with
whom you choose to provide your Personal Information or otherwise interact.</p>
<p><b>With Third Parties for Industry Analysis </b></p>
<p>In addition to sharing aggregated Non-Identifying
Information with Third Party Publishers, we may also share aggregated
Non-Identifying Information with advertisers and ad networks (“<b>Advertising
Entities</b>”) with whom we have strategic relationships. Unless you
specifically opt in to share your Personal Information, the information
that we share with these third parties will only be used in the form
of Non-Identifying Information to support user trend analyses and demographic
profiling. Some Third Party Publishers and Advertising Entities also
act as Service Providers (defined below) to us, so in those cases we
will share your information as described below.</p>
<p><b>With Preferred Partners</b></p>
<p>We may share your username, email address
and Device ID (“Specific Shared Data”) with certain of our preferred
Third Party Publishers and other business partners (“<b>Preferred
Partners</b>”) for those parties to assist us with providing you with
the aspect of the Services for which you provided such Specific Shared
Data to us, and to use such Specific Shared Data to provide you with
information and marketing materials about Third-Party Applications,
and other products and services, for example, to further enhance your
use of our Services and to augment your gaming and social networking
experience generally. We only share Specific Shared Data with our preferred
Third Party Publishers pursuant to an agreement under which the Third
Party Publisher is obligated to use such data solely for such purposes.</p>
<p>Some Preferred Partners also act as Service
Providers (defined below) to us, so in those cases we will also share
your Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information as described
below. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Privacy Policy,
we only share Specific Shared Data with our Preferred Partners pursuant
to an agreement under which the Preferred Partner is obligated to use
and disclose Specific Shared Data in compliance with applicable law.</p>
<p><b>With Third Party Social Networking
Services (SNSs)</b></p>
<p>As a user with a Full Account, you may
link your ngmoco account information with certain SNSs where other ngmoco
Users have existing SNS accounts. In these instances, with your permission
and on your behalf, we will share your email address and screen name
or alias with the applicable SNS. Through use of such services’ application
programming interfaces (APIs) we can receive certain information (which
may include your Personal Information) in accordance with the privacy
settings you have set in your SNS account, if any.</p>
<p>Other than what we may share with the
SNS in connection with your linking of accounts, the personal information
an SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent of our Services.
Other services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure
of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to
read the privacy policies or statements of the other services you use.</p>
<p><b>With our Service Providers</b></p>
<p>Disclosure of your Personal Information
and Non-Identifying Information may also occur where we engage or employ
service providers, vendors or other third party entities to facilitate
provision of our Services (each a “<b>Service Provider</b>”) (e.g.,
without limitation, improvement of our Services’ features, user account
authentication, promotion and marketing, administration, analytics,
virtual currency transactions, crowd-sourcing, cloud storage and other
related services), to provide the Services on our behalf, or to assist
us in analyzing how our Services are being used. Our Service Providers
may have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks
on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other
purpose.</p>
<p><b>Under Special Circumstances</b></p>
<p>At times, we may disclose information
about you to law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in
our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to
claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to
protect the property and rights of ngmoco or a third party, to protect
the safety of the public or any person or to prevent or stop activity
we may consider to be or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical
or legally actionable activity.</p>
<p>Under another special set of circumstances,
for example, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization
or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may sell, transfer
or otherwise share some or all of ngmoco assets, including your Personal
Information.</p>
<p><b>Our Policy Toward Children</b></p>
<p>We are committed to compliance with the
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<b>COPPA</b>”). Consequently,
we do not collect Personal Information from children under age 14 (“<b>child</b>”
or “<b>children</b>”) in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, and we
have developed an anonymous user experience that delivers a limited
version of our products and services for children, as described below.</p>
<p><i>Creation of a
“Limited Account” - Email Address Anonymization.</i></p>
<p>When a ngmoco User chooses to register
to join our Services, the ngmoco User is asked to select a user name
and password. In order to determine who is younger than 14 years old,
we ask the ngmoco User to enter birth month and year at the start of
the registration process. If the ngmoco User indicates that he/she is
a child, we collect and/or process the information provided by the child
to create a Limited Account.</p>
<p>A “<b>Limited Account</b>” is a ngmoco
account where the ngmoco User can enjoy a limited version of our Services,
but cannot disclose Personal Information about themselves via our Services.
When a ngmoco User indicates that he/she is under age 14 and attempts
to register with our Services we ask that ngmoco User to provide the
following information: (i) his/her first name only; and (ii) his/her
email address. The email address is collected for the sole purpose of
providing email reminders for password resets to the ngmoco User once
he or she completes registration for a Limited Account. When the email
address is provided by the ngmoco User, our system immediately alters
the email address by “hashing” the email address and assigns that
data an anonymous ID number such that the email address cannot be reconstructed
by us into its original form, but the “hashed” form can be used
for our password reminder system. This process reflects guidance provided
by the Federal Trade Commission (“<b>FTC</b>”). For more information
on COPPA and the FTC’s compliance recommendations you can visit <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm</a>.</p>
<p>Our practices regarding collection of
Non-Identifying Information, including Device IDs, and our practices
regarding use of Cookies and Other Technology and Log Data described
above in this Privacy Policy, apply to all ngmoco Users including children
who hold a Limited Account.</p>
<p>In certain ngmoco Applications, an ngmoco
User may participate as a non-registered ngmoco User through optional
registration. This allows an ngmoco User to play the game in a limited
capacity. Ngmoco does not collect any Personal Information or Non-Identifying
information, other than Device ID, for non-registered users. ngmoco
cannot and does not ensure the preservation of game data that is associated
with any non-registered account.</p>
<p><b>Location-Based Services</b></p>
<p>For location-based Services, we may collect,
use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic
location of your computer or mobile device. Unless you explicitly opt-in
to permit the use and sharing of your Personal Information regarding
your geographic location, your location data will only be collected
and used anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you.
When you opt in to Third-Party Application providers’ location services,
we will share your geographic location with such Third-Party Application
providers in connection with their location services.  Please note
that some location-based services may require your Personal Information
for the feature to work as intended.</p>
<p><b>Invite-A-Friend</b></p>
<p>If you choose to use our referral services
to tell a friend about our Services, we will ask you for your friend’s
name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time
email inviting him or her to use an aspect of our Services. ngmoco hashes
these email addresses after using them for the sole purpose of sending
this one-time email.</p>
<p> <b>Find-A-Friend</b></p>
<p>After an ngmoco User logs into his or
her Full Account or Limited Account, the ngmoco User can access the
find our find-a-friend feature. We present ngmoco Users with options
to search for a friend or group of friends. Options include, but are
not limited to, searching one of our Networks, scanning the ngmoco User’s
mobile device, and scanning the ngmoco User’s Facebook, Google or
Yahoo! contacts. The ngmoco User may either add an existing ngmoco User,
or invite a friend to join the Service through the third-party service.
To facilitate, ngmoco will provide interfaces to authenticate to such
third-party service. We do not store the ngmoco User’s login credentials.
The ngmoco User who uses this feature is bound by the terms of the third-party
service.   </p>
<p><b>Emailing Via a ngmoco Application</b></p>
<p>ngmoco Users may send pre-formatted messages
through use of their personal email account connected to their mobile
device to, for example, challenge their friends to beat their high score
in an ngmoco Application where this functionality is available. ngmoco
may store the email address of the friend that you choose to email via
our Services, but would only do so for social purposes such as generating
friend recommendations (e.g., in connection with “people you may know”
functionality). The message you initiate will be sent through your personal
email account to the email addresses you choose.</p>
<p><b>How We Protect Your Personal Information</b></p>
<p>ngmoco takes your privacy very seriously
and employs administrative, physical and electronic measures to safeguard
your information from identity theft and unauthorized access. We do
not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information,
your account ID, login password or national identification numbers in
a non-secure or unsolicited communication (e.g. via e-mail, telephone,
mobile device).</p>
<p>We will make any legally required disclosures
of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your
unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in
applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via
email or conspicuous posting on the Sites in the most expedient time
possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with
(i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary
to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity
of the data system.</p>
<p><b>Changing or Removing Information</b></p>
<p>As a user of a Full Account, your may
update or delete the Personal Information in your profile by logging
into your account. You may also email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ngmoco.com" target="_blank">privacy@ngmoco.com</a> to request that we delete your Personal Information
from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor
your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required
by law or for legitimate business purposes. Specific Shared Data cannot
be retrieved from Preferred Partners after its disclosure.</p>
<p>Where you share information with other
users through the communication channels of our Services, you generally
should not expect to have any ability to modify or remove such communications.
Nor should you expect us to modify or delete your comments upon your
request.</p>
<p>If you participate in a Promotion hosted
by us (where you may or may not disclose the information requested),
you have the option to opt out at any time from such participation and
the receipt of any related communications. Please follow the unsubscribe
instructions provided in the relevant communications.</p>
<p>If your friend received an invitation
from ngmoco per your referral to try the Services, your friend may request
that the name and email address used in the invitation be removed from
ngmoco’s records. We store this information for the sole purposes
of measuring the effectiveness of our referral program and sending the
email you initiated, but your friend can request to have it removed
from our database by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ngmoco.com" target="_blank">privacy@ngmoco.com</a>.</p>
<p><b>Links to Other Websites and Services</b></p>
<p>Our Services may contain links to other
websites and online services or offers from third parties. For example,
our Services may include offers from third party advertisers or the
ability to engage in transactions with such entities. Ngmoco Users with
Limited Accounts are not provided access to offers made by third party
advertisers requesting Personal Information via our Services. If an
ngmoco User with a Full Account chooses to participate in offer-linked
information requests or “clicks on” an advertisement or another
third party link, such ngmoco User may be directed to that third party’s
website or service and/or be prompted to provide Personal Information
in connection with such activity.</p>
<p>The fact that we link to a third party
website or service is not an endorsement or representation of our affiliation
with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of such third party’s
privacy or information security policies or practices or their compliance
with laws. We do not exercise control over third party websites or services.
These other websites or services may place their own cookies or other
files on your computer or mobile devices, collect data or solicit personal
information from you. Other websites and services follow different rules
regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit
to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements
of the other websites and services you use and the terms of the offers
in which you participate. You agree that ngmoco is not responsible for,
nor will it be liable to you or any third party for, your interaction
with such third parties or the information requests initiated by such
third parties or the subsequent use, treatment or dissemination of the
information you voluntarily choose to provide to them.</p>
<p><b>International Users</b></p>
<p>Information that you provide may be transferred
or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy
Policy.  If you are located outside the United States and choose
to provide information to ngmoco, we transfer Personal Information to
and process it in the United States. Your consent to this Privacy Policy
followed by your submission of Personal Information represents your
agreement to that transfer.</p>
<p>ngmoco abides by the <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank"><u>safe harbor framework</u></a> (“Safe Harbor”) set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding
the collection, use, and retention of personal information from individuals
who reside in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.  As detailed
in this Privacy Policy, we specifically agree to comply with each of
the seven Safe Harbor <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eg_main_018236.asp" target="_blank"><u>privacy principles</u></a>:  Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer (Transfers
to Third Parties), Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement.</p>
<p>Individuals who wish to file a complaint
or who take issue with our Safe Harbor policies should direct such communication
to us as specified in the Contacting Us section below.  If you
are sending us a privacy-related complaint, please provide it in English
because this will help expedite the process.</p>
<p>We will investigate and attempt to resolve
complaints regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance
with the principles contained in this Privacy Statement. For complaints
that cannot be resolved between ngmoco and a complainant, we agree to
participate in the dispute resolution procedures of the panel established
by the European Union Data Protection authorities to resolve such disputes.</p>
<p><b>Your California Privacy Rights </b></p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83
permits customers of ngmoco who are California residents to request
certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information
to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you are a California
resident and have provided ngmoco with personal information within the
last year, you may make such a request by emailing us at the following
email address with the email’s subject titled as “California Privacy
Rights”: <a href="mailto:privacy@ngmoco.com" target="_blank">privacy@ngmoco.com</a>.</p>
<p>Within 30 days of receiving such a request,
we will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed
to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes
during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names
