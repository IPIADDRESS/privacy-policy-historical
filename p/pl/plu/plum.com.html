This page, and the pages linked from here, are our Privacy &amp; Copyright Policy and our Terms &amp; Conditions.
</p>
<p>
Our Terms &amp; Conditions and Privacy Policy are currently in draft form and may change while the Plum service is in its early beta period.  During this period, we may make material changes to this document and note them <em>only</em> here.
</p>
<b>What's in this document</b>

<ul>
	<li> It's a simple, easy to digest explanation of our policies and, more importantly, your rights as a member of the Plum community.
	</li><li> Plum is a place where people can collect and share their personal libraries.  We provide a valuable and innovate service for you, and we realize you've placed your trust in us.  Because of that, want you to know what we're doing to preserve and protect that trust, and in turn, how you can help preserve trust, your rights and the rights of all members of the Plum community.
	</li><li> This document has three parts:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#partI">Privacy and Copyright: Your privacy as a member of the Plum community</a>
			</li><li><a href="/terms.plum">Terms &amp; Conditions: Your obligations as a member of the Plum community </a>

<b>Part I: Your privacy as a member of the Plum community</b>

<p>
This is our privacy and copyright policy.  We know you've placed trust in us and expect us to both keep your personal information private and to protect your rights to the information you've included in your personal library.  We believe that "what's yours is yours."  
</p>
</a><p><a name="partI">
That means that your personal information belongs to you, and we will only use it with your permission.  When including things of your own creation in your personal library, you retain all rights to them, if you set them to private. Plum's purpose is to allow the easy sharing of personal libraries and facilitate the collection of all forms of media.  When you choose to share things of your creation in your collections (by making them public), you do so with a </a><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/" target="_NEW">Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike</a> license.
</p>

<b>Your private account information and information we collect passively from you</b>
<br> <br>
<i>What this covers:</i>

<ul>
	<li>This section covers information that is only visible to Plum systems.  These are things that other Plum users cannot see.
	</li><li>This includes information you provide to us during the registration process, as well as your account and collection settings.
	</li><li>It also includes information that we collect "passively" as you use our service.  This is information that ends up in our server and system logs, cookies we may set, and any other information that's collected through technical means while you use the Plum service.
</li></ul>

<i>The Basics:</i>

<ul>
 	<li>First and foremost, we want you to know that you own all personal information you provide to Plum.  While this information is "deposited" with us, it is and will always remain your property.
	</li><li>We will never sell this information, nor will we share it in any form that can identify you individually with third parties who aren't our agents.  
	</li><li>If you no longer want to be a member of the Plum community, you can deactivate your Plum account at any time.  While we're in our beta period, you can have your account deactivated by contacting us by <a href="/feedback.plum?s=privacy_deactivate1">clicking here.</a>  If you do, we delete all private information you've provided to us from our systems.  (You should be aware that this information may still exist in backup files, but these files are never used or accessed except in the event of a significant system failure.)
	</li><li>If you've deleted your account, some of the "passive" information we've collected may still exist in log files.  However, there's no way to link this information to you individually once your account has been deactivated.
	</li><li>Plum needs to comply with the law, ensure our service is used lawfully and for its intended purpose, and ensure that people's lives aren't threatened because of anything that might happen with Plum.  This means that there may be times when we may be required to disclose your private information to comply with a valid legal order (for example, a warrant or subpoena), to investigate fraud or egregious misuse of the Plum service, or to in situations involving physical harm to any person.

<b>Your collections and other public information</b>

<br><br>
<i>Your collections have three parts:</i>

<ul>
	<li>Information created by you.  These are things for which you own the copyright.  For example, this might include an original note you author or a photograph you've taken.
	</li><li>Information you collect.  These are things for which other people own the copyright.  For example, this might include an image you find on the web or a copy of something in someone else's collections.
	</li><li>Comments and ratings made on your collections or you make on those of other people.
</li></ul>

<i>The Basics:</i>

<p>Information you create</p>

<ul>
	<li>You retain the copyright to information you create that is set to be private.
	</li><li>If information you create is set to be public or shareable with a group, it is licensed with a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/" target="_NEW">Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike</a> license.  This means that other people can copy and make derivative works from the information.
	</li><li>Once something has been set to public or group sharable, the license is always <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/" target="_NEW">Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike</a>, even if you subsequently change that item to be private.  (However, changing the item back to private does restrict access to your copy of it to yourself.)
	</li><li>Information you create that is public or group sharable can be copied by other users and placed in their own personal libraries.
	</li><li>You can remove or edit information you create that's in your collections.  However, removing or editing your copy of the information will not alter copies in other people's personal libraries.
	</li><li>If you deactivate your Plum account, things in your collections that are set to private will be removed. Items set to public or group sharable, and copies of items you created in other people's personal libraries, will not be removed.
	</li><li>When you put something in your collections -- and thus it's visible on the Plum site -- we reserve the right to place advertisements or other promotions on the same webpage.  Plum currently retains the revenue from these ads and promotions.
</li></ul>

<p>Information you collect</p>

<ul>
	<li>If something you add to your collections belongs to someone else (for example, a web page, link, photo, feed, song, or a copy of an item in someone else's collections), they retain all intellectual property rights to it, subject to its license.  That means they have the final say on what happens to it and can <a href="#asterisk2">request the removal of it at any time*</a>.
	</li><li>When you add some types of things to your collections, like a photo or a webpage, our system may make a copy of it on Plum's servers.  You can see an example of this when you collect a web page and a facsimile of it appears on the Plum site.  Although a facsimile the item appears in your collections, the copyright holder <a href="#asterisk2">can request removal of it at any anytime*</a>. 
</li></ul>

<p>Comments and ratings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When you rate or comment on something in someone's collections, your comments are licensed using the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/" target="_NEW">Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike</a> license.
	</li><li>Comments and ratings cannot be changed or deleted.  Inappropriate or abusive comments should be reported using this form.

<p>Account and passively collected information</p>

<ul>
    <li>When you register to use Plum, we collect some basic information from you, including your name, email address, and location.  This information is only used for the Plum service to you and for aggregate analysis.
    </li><li>You can opt-out from recieving certain communications by changing the "Send me occasional updates with news and announcements from Plum" setting.
    </li><li>Plum's service can notify you when things in your collections or your friend's collections.  If you don't want to recieve these emails, you need to <a href="/feedback.plum?s=privacy_deactivate2">deactivate your account.</a>
	</li><li>When you use the Plum system, we collect some information "passively."  This means that it's automatically collected by our servers when you use Plum.
	</li><li> This "passively" collected information includes your IP address and serveral cookies that identify your account (so that other people can't pretend to be you) and web browser to our servers.  We use this information for diagnostic purposes and aggregate analysis.
	</li><li> In certain places on the Plum site, we may make use of third party ad servers or web analysis tools.  These agents may set other cookies or use "web beacons."  However, in no case can the data collected by these agents identify you personally.
</li></ul>


<a name="partIII">	
<i>Other things you should know:</i>

<p>
In the event that we add new features to the Plum site that involve issues concerning your rights that aren't covered here or in the documents linked to from here, we will note that where and when you see that feature, clearly explain the issues, and give you're the ability to consent to anything different that happens involving your private or public information.
</p>
<p>
There may come a time when we need to change this statement of your rights, for example if Plum is no longer an independent company.  In the event that we make any material change to these rights, we'll notify you by putting a prominent notice on the Plum site and giving you the option to deactivate your account if you wish.  Plum will also do this if we merge with or are acquired by another entity and your information becomes subject to a different set of policies. What constitutes a "material change" will be determined at Plum's sole discretion, in good faith and using common sense and reasonable judgment.
