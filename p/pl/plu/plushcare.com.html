YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING HEALTH INFORMATION ABOUT YOU
 <br> 
 <br>
You have certain rights regarding your PHI, which are explained below. You may exercise these rights by submitting a request in writing to our Privacy Officer.
 <br> 
 <br>
A. You have the right to inspect and copy your PHI. If you would like to see or copy your PHI that is contained in a designated record set (e.g., medical and billing records), we are required to provide you access to such PHI for inspection and copying within 30 days after receipt of your request (with up to a 30-day extension if needed). We may charge you a reasonable fee to cover duplication, mailing and other costs incurred by us in complying with your request. In addition, there are situations where we may deny your request for access to your PHI. For example, we may deny your request if we believe the disclosure will endanger your life or that of another person. Depending on the circumstances of the denial, you may have a right to have this decision reviewed.
 <br> 
 <br>
Under California law, we must permit you or your representative to inspect your medical records during business hours within five (5) working days after receipt of a written request by you or your representative.
 <br>
 <br> 
 <br>
California law further provides that you or your representative are entitled to copies of all or any portion of your patient records upon presenting a written request specifying the records to be copied, together with a fee to defray the cost of copying, that shall not exceed twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page or fifty cents ($0.50) per page for records that are copied from microfilm and any additional reasonable clerical costs incurred in making the records available. We are required to ensure that the copies are transmitted within fifteen (15) days after receiving the written request. We may choose to prepare a summary of your medical record rather than allowing access to the entire record, in which case we must make the summary of the record available to you within ten (10) working days (with up to a 20-day extension if needed) from the request date.
 <br> 
 <br>
B. You have the right to request a restriction of your PHI. This means you may ask us not to use or disclose any part of your PHI for purposes of treatment, payment or health care operations. You may also request that any part of your PHI not be disclosed to family members or friends who may be involved in your care or for notification purposes as described in this Notice. Your request must state the specific restriction requested and to whom you want the restriction to apply. We are not required to agree to a restriction that you may request, except we must agree not to disclose your PHI to your health plan if the disclosure (1) is for payment or health care operations and is not otherwise required by law, and (2) relates to a health care item or service which you paid for in full out of pocket. If we agree to the requested restriction, we may not use or disclose your PHI in violation of that restriction unless it is needed to provide emergency treatment.
 <br> 
 <br>
C. You have the right to request to receive confidential communications from us by alternative means or at an alternative location. We will accommodate reasonable requests. We may also condition this accommodation by asking you for information as to how payment will be handled or specification of an alternative address or other method of contact.
 <br> 
 <br>
D. You have the right to amend your PHI. This means you may request an amendment of your PHI in our records that is contained in a designated record set (e.g., medical and billing records) for as long as we maintain the PHI. We will respond to your request within 60 days (with up to a 30-day extension if needed). We may deny your request if, for example, we determine that your PHI is accurate and complete. If we deny your request, we will send you a written explanation and allow you to submit a written statement of disagreement.
 <br> 
 <br>
E. You have the right to receive an accounting of certain disclosures that we have made of your PHI. You have the right to receive an accounting of certain disclosures we have made, if any, of your PHI. This right only applies to disclosures for purposes other than treatment, payment or health care operations as described in this Notice. It also excludes disclosures we may have made to you, your family members or friends involved in your care. The right to receive this information is subject to certain exceptions, restrictions and limitations. You must specify a time period for the accounting, which may not be longer than 6 years and cannot include any date before April 14, 2003. You may request a shorter timeframe. You have the right to one free request within any 12-month period, but we may charge you for any additional requests in the same 12-month period. We will notify you about any such charges, and you are free to withdraw or modify your request in writing before any charges are incurred. We will respond to your request within 60 days (with up to a 30-day extension if needed).
 <br> 
 <br>
F. You have the right to obtain a paper copy of this Notice from us. You have the right to receive a paper copy of this Notice upon request. You may ask us to give you a copy of this Notice at any time.
 <br> 
 <br>
G. You have the right to be notified if you are affected by a breach of unsecured PHI.
 <br> 
 <br>
H. You have the right to opt out of receiving fundraising communications from us. We may contact you for fundraising purposes. You have the right to opt out of receiving these communications.
