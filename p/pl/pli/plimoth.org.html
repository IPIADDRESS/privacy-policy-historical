              <p><b>Online Surveys:</b></p>
            <p>On occasion, PP may post visitor surveys on its website. These 
                  are completely voluntary in nature. If you choose to participate, 
                  you may do so anonymously unless otherwise indicated. The information 
                  gathered from these surveys is used by PP to better understand 
                  our visitorsÍ interests and needs. It is never sold, rented, 
                  or shared with any third party for any reason.</p>
              <p><b>Information Collected Automatically:</b></p>
            <p>PP collects information related to website usage (e.g., the 
                  website pages frequently visited by our guests). This information 
                  is collected automatically for the sole purpose of analyzing 
                  our websiteÍs usage patterns, and is not shared with or sold 
                  to any third parties for any reason.</p>
              <p><b>Emails and Newsletters:</b></p>
            <p>PP occasionally sends special email newsletters to registered 
                  visitors, members, donors, and friends. These notify you of 
                  upcoming programs, special events, news, and promotional offers. 
                  Anyone may subscribe or unsubscribe to the newsletter at any 
                  time. You may register to receive email newsletters by filling 
                  out the "First to Know" pop-up box on our website. 
                  Instructions for unsubscribing are found at the end of every 
                  email communication that is sent out to you by PP.</p>
                <p>PP tries to respond to email messages that are sent by visitors 
                  in a timely fashion. Email inquiries regarding online transactions 
                  of any kind (museum shop, ticket, membership, donations) are 
                  confidential and are forwarded to the appropriate department 
                  within PP. PP may save this information for its records, and 
                  to serve you better in the future. The content of any messages 
                  sent to PP that do not relate to an online transaction are considered 
                  non-confidential and non-proprietary.</p>
              <p><b>Data Security:</b></p>
            <p>All of the transactions that take place over the PP website 
                  are protected by a secure server. PP makes every reasonable 
                  effort to ensure that all sensitive financial data is used correctly 
                  and accurately. PP has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, 
                  and administrative procedures to safeguard all the information 
                  we collect online.</p>
              <p><b>Third Party Service Providers</b>:</p>
            <p>In order to help us serve our visitors better, PP may contract 
                  with third-party vendors. PP requires all such third-party vendors 
                  to maintain the confidentiality and security of the personally-identifiable 
                  information they are supplied with in order to complete a transaction. 
                  These vendors are prohibited from using this information in 
                  any way not authorized by PP.</p>
