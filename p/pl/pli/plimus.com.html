Information Collection</strong></span></u></p><p>Plimus collects information through its Web site and related e-Commerce services at several points.&nbsp;</p><p>We collect the following information about casual web site visitors: the IP address of the visiting machine for "geographic" statistical purposes.We may also collect names and email addresses that our users voluntarily divulge about themselves and others, such as referrals or business leads.</p><p>We also collect user registration data when Product Suppliers or Affiliates register to use Plimus e-Commerce services by means of voluntary submission forms for the purpose of providing such users with our services. Information is also collected from online forms completed by people wishing to learn more about the Plimus or from emails sent to Plimus.</p><p>Plimus also collects personal and payment information from online transaction forms including those generated through Plimus APIs and completed by end Customers using Plimus’ e-Commerce services to buy products, subscriptions and services ("Products") from Product Suppliers selling their products through Plimus.</p><p>To receive Products sold through Plimus and E-commerce services provided by Plimus, personal information is required because it is used to accurately build a Customer profile and for ongoing communication with Customers and Product Suppliers. Other information we request is optional.</p><p><strong><span class="colored">Cookies</span></strong></p><p>Plimus employs cookies.

Information Usage</span></strong></u></p><p>The information collected by BlueSnap, Inc. will be used by Plimus in conjunction with the terms specified in this document. Users who provide information may receive email announcements regarding Plimus' services from time to time.</p><p>Registered Product Suppliers  may receive additional announcements from Plimus about transactions generated through Plimus e-Commerce services, instant notifications, Plimus service changes, revisions and updates, affiliate product opportunities, services, legal notices, special offers, and a newsletter.</p><p>Plimus may also use personal information to provide announcements about functions or services that users are registered to use, about any user account they may create, about fulfillment of a specific transaction that may be requested, or about other significant developments that may affect use of the Site and or e-Commerce services.

As Plimus is acting as a merchant for Product Suppliers we need to share relevant Customer information with the specific Product Supplier involved in the transaction in order for them to fulfill the transaction. Such information, if provided to Product Suppliers, is supplied on the condition that it should not be used for spamming or direct marketing by another party.</p><p>Out of respect for the privacy of our Customers we present the option to opt out of any mailing lists operated by Plimus or relevant Product Suppliers as set out in the Opt Out section of this policy.  &nbsp;</p><p>Where Customer data is passed to a relevant Product Supplier the use of such information may be subject to the privacy policy of such Product Supplier and their standards may differ from those of Plimus.                             We may supplement information collected through our Web site with data from other sources such as credit history to authorize purchases.</p><p><strong><span class="colored">Payment Data&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p>Personal payment information such as Credit Card numbers, bank account information is routinely collected and passed on to authorized payment processors in order to make payments sanctioned by Plimus Customers. Such information is handled through industry standard secure protocols and where appropriate in accordance with relevant Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance standards. Such information may also be passed when making payment via Plimus through mobile devices.</p><p>Such data may also be encrypted and securely stored by Plimus in accordance with PCI standards. When expressly directed and approved by a Customer it may be used to generate recurring or new transactions as requested by such Customer.</p><p>We may also pass transaction information provided Customers through certain anti-fraud screening procedures and services provided by anti-fraud companies to detect stolen Credit Card information and other online fraud.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span class="colored">Affiliate Tracking Information</span></strong></p><p>Certain product transactions may have taken place following a valid referral by a recognized Affiliate introduction. In such cases basic non-personal information about the transaction will be tracked and passed to the relevant Affiliate so that their role in the sale can be recorded and any due Affiliate commission paid over at the relevant time.</p><p><strong><span class="colored">Forums and Group Boards</span></strong></p><p>The Plimus Web site offers forums and message boards. Please be advised that information voluntarily posted in these venues becomes public knowledge.</p><p><strong><span class="colored">External Links</span></strong></p><p>We offer links to other Web sites including those of Product Suppliers. Please note: When clicking on links to other Web sites, we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Their standards may differ from ours.</p><p><strong><span class="colored">Compliance with Court Orders &amp; Law Enforcement Agencies</span></strong></p><p>Plimus may disclose personal information without notification in order to comply with a legal requirement, court order or subpoena or to cooperate with law enforcement or government agencies.</p><p><strong><span class="colored">Merger, Sale, Transfer of Corporate Assets or Reorganization</span></strong></p><p>Plimus may transfer information as part of any corporate merger, sale, acquisition, transfer or assets or reorganization without notice.
