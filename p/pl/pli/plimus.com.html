Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site and newsletters by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. &nbsp;</p><p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  &nbsp;</p><p>Certain software and online services sold through Plimus may also monitor license usage or login frequency in accordance with terms of use specifically related to such products or services and are also covered by this notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><u><span class="colored"><strong>Part II. Information Usage</strong></span>&nbsp;</u></p><p>The information collected by BlueSnap, Inc. will be used by Plimus in conjunction with the terms specified in this document. Users who provide information may receive email announcements regarding Plimus' services from time to time.&nbsp;</p><p>Registered Product Suppliers may receive additional announcements from Plimus about transactions generated through Plimus e-Commerce services, instant notifications, Plimus service changes, revisions and updates, affiliate product opportunities, services, legal notices, special offers, and a newsletter.&nbsp;</p><p>Plimus may also use personal information to provide announcements about functions or services that users are registered to use, about any user account they may create, about fulfillment of a specific transaction that may be requested, or about other significant developments that may affect use of the Site and or e-Commerce services. Users cannot normally opt-out of this kind of email communication.&nbsp;</p><p>Information we collect from Customers may be used to create online invoices, transaction confirmation notices, delivery of licenses, access keys and product download files and associated documentation, subscription accounts, instant notifications relating to such transactions, refunds and refund notices, warranty and dispute records, and customer profiles based on browsing or purchasing history. As Plimus is acting as a Merchant and/or Reseller for Product Suppliers we need to share relevant Customer information with the specific Product Supplier involved in the transaction in order for them to fulfill the transaction. Such information, if provided to Product Suppliers, is supplied on the condition that it should not be used for spamming or direct marketing by another party. &nbsp;</p><p>Out of respect for the privacy of our Customers we present the option to opt out of any mailing lists operated by Plimus or relevant Product Suppliers as set out in the Opt Out section of this policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Where Customer data is passed to a relevant Product Supplier the use of such information may be subject to the privacy policy of such Product Supplier and their standards may differ from those of Plimus. &nbsp;</p><p><span class="colored"><strong>Payment Data&nbsp;</strong></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Personal payment information such as Credit Card numbers, bank account information, name, email address and phone number is routinely collected and passed on to authorized payment processors in order to make payments sanctioned by Plimus Customers. Such information is handled through industry standard secure protocols such as SSL and where appropriate in accordance with relevant Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance standards. Such information may also be passed when making payment via Plimus through mobile devices.&nbsp;</p><p>Such data may also be encrypted and securely stored by Plimus in accordance with PCI standards.
