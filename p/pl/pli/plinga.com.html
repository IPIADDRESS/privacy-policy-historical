                <p>Azerion Products and the third parties with whom we interact, process personal data mostly through the use of cookies. To help you understand what this means, we will first describe the use of cookies in our Azerion Products. We will then explain how personal data is processed, including the use of those cookies.</p>
                <h2>1. How do we use cookies?</h2>
                <p>Cookies are small pieces of information (small files) stored within your browser or on your portable device. As the Azerion Products owner, we place cookies when you visit our Azerion websites, games or apps, as do the third-parties that we work with directly to deliver games and ads. While we control this process, you can use our consent tool to make choices about the cookies you wish to allow and the personal data processing that occurs with the help of those cookies. Because of the way online games and ads work, third parties with whom we do not work directly, but who also deliver games and ads via our Azerion Products, may also place cookies. This is not something we can control.</p>
                <p>Below we describe which cookies the Azerion Products use, for what purpose, and the duration of their use.</p>
                <h3>1.1 Cookies that help to ensure that the Azerion Products function properly</h3>
                <p>Our Azerion Products use cookies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to remember information, you enter when you fill in forms or input fields on various pages. We do this so that you won’t have to enter all of this information again the next time you visit.</li>
                    <li>to store preferences such as language settings, location settings, the number of search results you wish to display per page, etc.</li>
                    <li>to store settings for optimal (video) display, such as the optimal or desired buffer size and information regarding your screen resolution.</li>
                    <li>to read your browser settings, ensuring that our Azerion Products is displayed properly on your screen.</li>
                    <li>to detect abuse of our Azerion Products and services, for instance by registering repeated failed attempts to log in.</li>
                    <li>to ensure an even load (page requests) across the Azerion Products, allowing us to keep the Azerion Products available to our visitors.</li>
                    <li>to offer the option to store login details so that you do not have to log in manually the next time you visit the Azerion Products.</li>
                    <li>to enable you to interact with our Azerion Products in a whole range of different ways, such as social media interaction, or leaving direct feedback.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>1.2 Cookies allowing us to sell and show ads</h3>
                <p>Most of our domains/games are provided free of charge, we rely on advertising invoice to enable us to do this. This means that ads are a vital source of income and are necessary to keep the domains running.<br> Several advertisements (or videos) use cookies. These ads are placed in our Azerion Products by us and/or media companies and advertising networks. Advertising networks and media companies function as a middleman between us as the Azerion Products owner and advertisers.<br> These cookies ensure that it is possible to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>track which ads you have already seen and prevent you from being shown the same content over and over again.</li>
                    <li>track how many visitors click on an advertisement, so that we can balance the books with advertisers.</li>
                    <li>track how many orders are placed through the displayed ads, so that we can balance the books with advertisers.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Please note that you will still be shown advertisements even if these cookies are not used. After all, we also display ads that do not use cookies.</p>
                <p>For more information regarding the cookies used by these advertising networks and the data these parties collect using those cookies, we refer you to the terms and conditions / privacy policies applicable to these platforms as listed on their own websites.

                <h3>1.3 Cookies that allow us to gather information about the way visitors use our Azerion Products</h3>
                <p>We aim to provide our visitors with relevant information. That is why we work to tailor our products to each visitor’s needs and interest.</p>
                <p>In order to reflect to your interests more accurately, we try to identify the things you like based on the Azerion Products you have previously visited. To find out which sections of our Azerion Products, visitors like best, we continuously try to measure how many visitors each of our Azerion Products attract, and which products are most popular. To do this, we use our own cookies and/or those provided by third parties.<br> The information gathered using this method, is used to generate site statistics. These statistics provide us with insights, such as how often visitors use our products, which products they spend the most time viewing, how often they interact with a product or part of it. This allows us to make the structure, navigation, and content of our website as user-friendly as possible.</p>
                <p>On the basis of your online history, you may see advertisements from a certain category, such as “women aged 35-45, married, with children, interested in ballet”. This group will be shown different ads than the group “men aged 20-30, unmarried, interested in cooking”.</p>
                <p>We do not use these statistics or other reports to trace back to individual people.<br> Third parties (advertisers) which provide cookies via our products may use similar technologies to find out what interests you. In that case, information about your current visit to our products could be combined with information from earlier visits to other websites besides our own.</p>
                <p>When such cookies are not used, this does not mean that you will no longer be shown any ads on our products. Instead, the ads will just be less likely to match your interests.</p>
                <p>We use cookies to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>register your visit on websites, which you browse in order to ascertain what you might be interested in.</li>
                    <li>identify whether you clicked on an advertisement (i.e. click-through behaviour).</li>
                    <li>provide information about your preferences and browsing behaviour to other Azerion Products.</li>
                    <li>use services provided by third parties to display ads (re-targeted marketing).</li>
                    <li>show more interesting ads based on your social media usage (i.e. social media behaviour).</li>
                    <li>keep track of the number of visitors on our products.</li>
                    <li>keep track of the amount of time visitors spend on our products.</li>
                    <li>determine the order in which a visitor views the various products.</li>
                    <li>determine which parts of our products need to be adjusted.</li>
                    <li>optimise the products (or parts of it).</li>
                </ol>
