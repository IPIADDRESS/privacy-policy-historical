<h4>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Google Analytics</h4>

<p>Our Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics also uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about your use of our Site are usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. As “IP anonymization” is activated for our Site, your IP address will be truncated by Google within Member States of the European Union or within Member States of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the US and be truncated there. Google will use this information on our behalf to analyze your use of the Site, to compile reports on website activity and to provide services to us related to the use of the internet or the Site.</p>

<p><br>
According to Google’s terms, the IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics will not be merged with other data of Google. You can reject the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser software; however, please note that you may not be able to use to all functionalities of the Site to its full extent in this case. You can also prevent transmission of the data generated by the cookie and relating to your usage of the Site (incl. your IP address) to Google as well as the processing of these data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link:&nbsp;<a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>&nbsp;or by clicking at the following link:&nbsp;<a href="javascript:gaOptout()"> Opt-Out for&nbsp;Google Analytics </a>. &nbsp;For information on the data use and retention practices of Google and its affiliates and subsidiaries, please see Google’s Privacy Policy currently located at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">www.google.com/privacy.html</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties&nbsp;</h4>

<p>As a matter of principle, we do not share your personal data with others unless permitted by law. We will ask you for your express consent prior to any disclosure of your personal data to any cooperation or advertising partner, if such consent is required by law.&nbsp;<br>
In addition, in certain cases, legal requirements and in particular the obligation to protect the legitimate interests of responsible data controllers may require us to disclose your personal data to third parties, inter alia in the event of a suspicion of a crime or abuse of the Site. In this case we may be obliged to disclose your personal data to law enforcement bodies and/or competent courts.</p>

<h4><br>

<h3><br>
B. &nbsp; &nbsp;plista Services</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;plista Technology on Websites within the plista-Network&nbsp;</h4>

<p>plista Services provide customized recommendations of content and ads to visitors of websites within the plista-network. In doing so, plista compares the interests of visitors of the websites to other users and recommends content based on interests of similar users. Therefore, it is necessary that we can (a) analyze interests and (b) differentiate between individual website visitors. If you visit a website that has implemented plista products, plista will place a cookie with a retention time of one year that includes a randomly assigned identifier. &nbsp;Thereafter, the cookie will be used to collect information about how our services are accessed or used, including category of content on the site, type of technology/widget, language of the content, browser, operating system, device type and whether you click on or interact with an advertisement or other content (collectively, “Usage Information”). Usage Information does not include names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or similar personal data. &nbsp;We may collect your IP address for delivery of advertising and fraud detection, but any such IP addresses are processed and hashed for storage.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>
As a matter of principle, recommendations do not use personal data. In order to be able to deliver recommendations to website users that fit their interests, we compile the relevant Usage Information into a profile that is associated with a randomly assigned identifier and analyze it. We may also use data provided by our affiliates and third parties to supplement such profiles and assist with recommendations. &nbsp;For example, our affiliate Xaxis, Inc. operates and maintains a proprietary data management platform that plista may utilize to help deliver Services.</p>

<p><br>
You may opt out of customized recommendations via the plista Service on the browser you are using. &nbsp;For instructions and additional information, please visit our opt-out page --&nbsp;<a href="https://www.plista.com/opt-out">https://www.plista.com/opt-out</a>&nbsp;-- or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com">www.youronlinechoices.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>
We are a member of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) and, in connection with our membership, adhere to the IAB Europe EU Framework for Online Behavioral Advertising in those markets where that self-regulatory framework applies. &nbsp;For information about interest-based advertising and the choices available to you, and to opt out of third-party interest-based advertisements from us and other participating EDAA member companies via cookies, please click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/">here</a>.</p>

<h4><br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Using plista-Services as a Website Operator or Advertiser&nbsp;</h4>

<p>In order to grant you access to our Site and in order to be able to use our Services as a website operator or an advertiser, we may request information about your company and its representatives. If and insofar as personal data are transferred to plista in this context, plista observes the principle of purpose limitation in accordance with applicable data protection law.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>
We may request personal data for billing and advertising purposes and to implement your monthly online advertising campaign or to market one or more websites. This data will only be collected if you have explicitly agreed, contributed and were sufficiently informed.</p>

<h4><br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Disclosure to Third Parties</h4>

<p>We may disclose the information we collect about recipients of Services, and information derived from it, to our affiliates, clients and service providers. &nbsp;As we do not collect users’ names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or similar personal data through our Services, we do not disclose any such information to third parties. &nbsp;However, if you decide to provide personal data via one of our clients’ advertisements or sites, then that information will be received by that client and will be subject to that client’s privacy policy. &nbsp;</p>

<p><br>
In addition, in certain cases, legal requirements and in particular the obligation to protect the legitimate interests of responsible data controllers may require us to disclose data collected through the Services to third parties, inter alia in the event of a suspicion of a crime or abuse. In this case we may be obliged to disclose such data to law enforcement bodies and/or competent courts.</p>
