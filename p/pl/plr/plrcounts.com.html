Oklahoma Limited Liability Company who takes the job of guarding your personal

<br>
We will not give any information about you to others without your express 
permission. Our network of sites uses forms in which you give us contact 
information (your name, e-mail address, address, telephone number, etc.) so you 
can receive information from us or to place orders with us. We use your customer 
information only when it will be important for us to contact you regarding 
updates or changes to our programs or products and special offers we think 
you'll find valuable. We also will send you information related to the topics 
you signed up about to further help in the education process. <br>
<br>
At all times if you find that you wish to stop receiving communication from us, 
simply click on UNSUBSCRIBE at the bottom of any newsletter that you are a part 
of. Understand that from time to time you may end up subscribing to several 
different specialized newsletters that we offer, so you may still continue to 
receive messages from us, just through a different newsletter. If you are having 
issues unsubscribing simply send an e-mail to info@countonusllc.com, and we will 
assist you. <br>
<br>
We use information gathered about you from our site statistics (for example your 
IP address ) to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our 
Web site. We also gather broad demographic information from this data to help us 
improve our site and make your browsing and purchasing experience more 
enjoyable. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information, except 
as necessary to prevent fraud or abuse on our system.<br>

Our sites may contain links to other sites. Unfortunately Count On Us, LLC, is 
not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.<br>

As stated previously in this policy, unless we have given you notice and choice, 
we will not share your personal information except with a third party to assist 
us in the processing or securing of your personal information or when we are 
required by law , in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in 
order to conform to the edicts of the law, or we must comply with a legal 
process served on our web site. We may also need to give out your information if 
one of our partners requires it, but these situations are rare.<br>
