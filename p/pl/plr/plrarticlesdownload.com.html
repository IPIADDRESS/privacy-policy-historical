      </p>
      <p>Your  privacy is very important to us. I want to make your experience on the  Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and I want you to use  the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with  complete confidence.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
        I have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate my                 commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes                 how I collect  information from all end users of my Internet services (the  "Services")-those who access some of my Services but do not have  accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who may purchase Products and/or  pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members")-what                I do with the information I collect, and the choices Visitors and  Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. I  request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong> Personal Information I Collect and How It Is Used</strong><br>
  <br>
        Introduction. I collect information in different ways from  Visitors and Members who access the various parts of my Services and  the network of Web sites accessible through my Service. I use this  information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use my  Products and Services, and generally, <strong>do not share this information  with third parties. </strong>However, I may disclose personal information  collected if I have received your permission beforehand or in very special                 circumstances, such as when I believe that such disclosure is  required by law or other special cases described below.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        Registration:&nbsp; Members may be asked to provide certain personal  information when they sign up for my Products or Services including  name, address, billing information. The personal information collected from Members during  the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such  as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third  parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special  circumstances. </p>
      <p>However,  in instances where I and a partner jointly promote my  Services, I may provide the partner certain personal information, such  as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the  Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of  allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the  promotion.&nbsp; </p>
      <p> In this instance, personal  information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. I  may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal  information Members provide during registration (such as the total  number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail  below, I may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to  sell advertisements that appear on the Services.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
        I, Partners and Sponsors:&nbsp; Some products and services may  be offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate,  independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide  Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner  may need to collect and maintain personal information. In these  instances, you will be notified before any such data is collected or  transferred and may decide not to use that particular service or  feature.&nbsp; </p>
      <p> Additionally, my partners may have advertisements or co-branded Web  Pages that are cosponsored by an affiliate, independent contractor  seller, or non-affiliated partner. I may share  non-identifying and aggregate information (except as described above),  but not personal information, with such partners in order to administer  the co-branded products or services offered.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
        Online Shopping:&nbsp; At some Web sites, you can purchase products and  services or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter,  catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be  asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email  address, phone number, and credit/debit card information.&nbsp; </p>
      <p> If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order  sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information  about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone  number. I have no control over the third parties' use of any  personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please  exercise care when doing so.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
        If you  order services or products directly from me I will use the  personal information you provide only to process that order. I do not  share this information with outside parties except to the extent  necessary to complete that order.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        Online Advertisements:&nbsp; I may display my online  advertisements. In those cases I share aggregated and non-identifying  information about my Visitors and Members collected through the  registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions  with these advertisers.&nbsp; </p>
      <p> Additionally, in some instances, I use this aggregated and  non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements or joint  ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells me  the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement  tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying  information I have collected, I may then display or send the  advertisement to the intended audience. I do not share  personal information about its Visitors or Members with these  advertisers or joint venture companies.<br>
          <br>
        Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email  inquiries to me, the return email address is used to answer  the email inquiry I receive. I do not use the return email  address for any other purpose and does not share the return email  address with any third party.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        Voluntary Customer Surveys:&nbsp; I may periodically conduct both  business and individual customer surveys. I encourage my customers to  participate in these surveys because they provide us with important  information that helps us to improve the types of products and services  I offer and how I provide them to you. Your personal information and  responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is  conducted by a third party. Participation in my customer surveys is  voluntary.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        I may take the information I receive from individuals responding to my  Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses  of other customers I may have, to create broader, generic responses to  the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies,  education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic  information). I then use the aggregated information to improve the  quality of my services to you, and to develop new services and  products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may  be shared with third parties.<br>
  <br>
        Special Cases:&nbsp; It is my policy not to use or share the  personal information about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to the  ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt  out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.&nbsp; </p>
      <p> However, I may disclose personal information about Visitors or  Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites  accessible through my Services, for any reason if, in my sole  discretion, I believe that it is reasonable to do so, including:  credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law  enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications  Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental  or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is  necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone  who may be violating my Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, or  other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect me and my Members.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
  "Cookies" and How I Use Them. A "cookie" is a small data  file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain Web  sites. I may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for   statistical purposes to improve the products and services I provide and to   manage my telecommunications  networks.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left"> If you are a Visitor or Member I may use a cookie to save your  settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. These  cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer  information. Additionally, be aware that if you visit other Web sites  where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may be  required to accept cookies.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
        Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. I do not  control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for  information collected through them.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        My Commitment to Children's Privacy. Protecting children's  privacy is especially important to us. It is my policy to comply with  the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other  applicable laws. Therefore I restrict my Web site to persons eighteen  years or older.<br>
  <br>
        YOU MUST BE EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OR OLDER TO ACCESS THIS WEB SITE. IF  YOU ARE UNDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO ACCESS  THIS WEB SITE FOR ANY REASON. DUE TO THE AGE RESTRICTIONS FOR USE OF  THIS WEB SITE, NO INFORMATION OBTAINED BY THIS WEB SITE, FALLS WITHIN  THE CHILD ONLINE PRIVACY ACT (COPA) AND IS NOT MONITORED AS DOING  SO.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        Public Forums:&nbsp; Please remember that any information you may  disclose in any Member Directory, or other public areas of my Web  sites or the Internet, becomes public information. You should exercise  caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these public  areas.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
        Mine Commitment to Data Security:&nbsp; Services and Web sites  I sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse,  and alteration of the information under my control. While I make  every effort to ensure the integrity and security of my network and  systems, I cannot guarantee that my security measures will prevent  third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
