<p><b>WE UNDERSTAND</b> that you may have additional concerns about the privacy and security of information that is collected through our web site.  <b>We are committed to protecting the online privacy of visitors to our web site.</b></p>

<p>Our web site may contain links to other web sites.  We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of any of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors or other web sites to which we provide links from our web sites.  You should check the applicable privacy policy of the web site sponsor when linking to other web sites.</p>

<p>We do not collect any nonpublic personal information in connection with the use of this web site by policyholders and members of the general public.  We do, however, collect customer data from its independent agents who may use this web site to access our Agent Web interface.  Agent Web allows independent agents to make changes to policies, make payments, and inquire about the status of customer accounts.</p>

<p><b>COOKIES USED FOR AGENTS ONLY.</b>  We use “cookies” to enhance our independent agents’ access to Agent Web, which allows agents to transact business with us.  A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive.  Cookies do not store personal information about you, unless you knowingly provide it.  Cookies can store non-personal information, such as what web site pages or advertisements your browser has accessed.  We use cookies to store information and personalize our agents’ experience with Agent Web.  For example, cookies allow Agent Web to recognize a browser as a previous visitor, and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while an agent was previously browsing our web site.  Our cookies can also store an agent’s password and keep track of selections independent agents make.</p>

<p>You do have control over cookies.  Most browsers can be set to notify you when a cookie is being placed on your computer.  Most browsers can also be set to refuse to accept cookies, although this may affect your Internet experience.  You can also erase cookies that are already on your computer.  For more information about working with cookies, you should consult your user manual, FAQ, or “help” function of your specific browser and operating system software.</p>

<p><b>Email Communications</b></p>

<p>If you send us an email with questions or comments, we may use your personal information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your questions or comments for future reference. </p>

<p><b>Security of the Information We Collect</b></p>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to secure your personal information.  However, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet, and there is always some risk in transmitting information electronically.  The personal information we collect is stored within databases that we control.  As we deem appropriate, we use security measures consistent with industry standards, such as firewalls and encryption technology, to protect your information.  However, since no security system is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.</p>
