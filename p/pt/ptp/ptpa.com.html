                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1> 
<h3>Information We Collect and How We Use It</h3>
<h5>Information You Provide Us.</h5>
<p>PTPA Media collects personal information from you when you register with our site, update your profile, interact with other members, and use various features of our site. To register with PTPA Media, you must provide your name and e-mail address, and may also provide your date of birth and postal/zip code.</p>
<p>We also may request and retain information about your interests and activities, your opinion about products and services that we offer or are offered by a third party, your demographic information, your interaction with other users, and your use of the website. From time to time, we may ask you to respond to surveys or other requests for information, and we'll collect the information you provide. We may also collect information from you when you participate in giveaways and promotions offered on our Site.</p>
<h3>Information Other Sources Provide Us.</h3>
<p>We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from business partners, contractors, other third parties and public resources, and add it to other information we have collected.
</p><p>All personally identifiable information that we collect may become part of your PTPA Media profile, and may be used by PTPA Media as provided in this Privacy Policy or as disclosed at the time you provide the information or as otherwise agreed by you.
</p><h5>Information You Provide Us About Others.</h5>
<p>We may also collect and store personal information about other people that you provide to us. If you use our website to send others (friends, relatives, colleagues, etc.) a product as a gift, information that may interest them or messages (such as invitations) through our system, we may store your personal information and the personal information of each such recipient.
</p> 

<h3>Use of Other Technology To Collect Information</h3>
<h5>Web Log Files.</h5>
<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
</p><p>We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the website, to track users’ movements around the Website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.
</p><h5>Cookies.</h5>
<p>When you visit our website, we may assign your computer one or more cookies, to facilitate access to our site, personalize your online experience, and help provide information that is relevant to you.
</p><p> cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click “Help” in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of our website may not function properly.
</p><p>Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on our site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our site. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to use some of the interactive features offered on our website.
</p><p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on the website. We have no access to or control over these cookies. [See the “Third Parties” section.]
</p><h5>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs</h5>
<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Information gathered by clear gifs may be tied to our members’ personally identifiable information.
</p><p>Clear gifs may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website. We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
</p><h3>Uses of Information</h3>
<h5>In General.</h5>
<p>We may use information that we collect about you to create and manage your member profile, feature you in one or more areas of our site, communicate with you by e-mail, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us or other third parties, develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests on our site and on other sites, perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our products, services, or content, or products, services or content offered by others, administer contests and giveaways, enforce our terms and conditions, and manage our business.

These services may include processing credit card payments, delivering packages, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests, giveaways, surveys and other features offered through our website, by phone, or by mail. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purpose.

We may also share it with third parties to develop and deliver targeted marketing on our websites, on websites of third parties, or by other means. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources.

</p><h3>Communications from the Website</h3>
<h5>Special Offers and Updates.</h5> 
<p>We consistently have the opportunity to send you information on products, services, special deals, and promotions offered by PTPA Media and/or a third party. In cases where PTPA Media is presenting an offer by a third party, the offer will be brought to you by PTPA Media and typically fulfilled by the third party.

If you don’t want to opt-out of all communications be sure to select ‘Update Profile and Subscription Preferences’ instead of ‘Unsubscribe From All Emails’.

If you don’t want to opt-out of all communications be sure to select ‘Update Profile and Subscription Preferences’ instead of ‘Unsubscribe From All Emails’.

In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
