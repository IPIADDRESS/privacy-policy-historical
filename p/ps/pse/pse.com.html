	information is collected on this site?</h4><p>
	In order to provide you with certain services on our Site, we
	may need to collect different types of information. In
	particular, we occasionally may need to collect certain types of
	personal information (information that may be used to personally
	identify or contact you) in order to provide you with particular
	features, services, or offers. Here's a summary of the kinds of
	information we collect at the PSE Site, and how we collect that
	information:<br></p><div style="margin-left: 10px;"><p><b>A. Passive Collection</b><br>
	  Our software automatically collects certain information from
	  your computer when you log on or move about our Site. This
	  information is not linked to any other personal information
	  you tell us, it just gives us a broad picture of who is on our
	  Site and which areas your users are visiting. It is our way of
	  learning what's important to our users and what isn't, and
	  improving our Site to make it more interesting and useful for
	  you. It also enables us to provide improved security and
	  efficiency on our Site. The two main ways in which this
	  general information is collected are through "log files"
	  and "cookies."</p><p><b>(i) Log Files</b><br>
	  Log files are records of user activity collected to analyze
	  trends, administer the Site, track user's movement, and
	  gather broad types of information for aggregate use. The kinds
	  of general information we collect in the log files includes: 
	  </p><ul><li>The IP address of your computer<br></li><li>How many people visit our Site<br></li><li>Which pages of our Site are visited most often<br></li><li>Which ISPs our visitors come from (e.g. AOL, MSN, etc.)<br></li><li>Which browsers users are used to visit our Site
		  (Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc.)<br></li><li>Time of day users visit our Site
	  </li></ul><p><b>(ii) Cookies</b><br>
	  PSE also uses "cookies" to gauge how users interact with
	  our Site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's
	  hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies
	  cannot execute code or deliver a virus to your computer. Usage
	  of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable
	  information, it merely helps the Site to be more efficient.
	  Typically, a cookie enables your computer to load Web site
	  files faster on subsequent visits. We also use cookies to
	  track a user's path for security purposes, as well as to
	  target your interests in an effort to enhance your experience
	  on our Site. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of
	  cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or help
	  screen to learn about these functions. If you reject a cookie,
	  you may still use our Site, however, you may be limited in
	  your use of certain areas. Please note: some of our business
	  partners (for example, advertisers) may use cookies on our
	  Site and we have no access to or control over these cookies.</p><p><b>B. Active Collection</b><br>
	  At several places on our Site, we collect certain information
	  that you voluntarily provide to us which may contain
	  personally identifiable information (for example, your name,
	  street and e-mail address, or telephone number). Such
	  personally identifiable information could also include any
	  other information you may provide when voluntarily
	  participating in customer service contacts, surveys, or other
	  transactions. Here is a brief summary of the areas on our Site
	  where you may be asked to provide information:</p><p><b>(i) Registration</b><br>
	  One or more areas of our Site may require you to register for
	  access. As part of the registration process we may ask you for
	  a username, password, or other personally identifiable
	  information in order to verify your identity, establish the
	  account, promote security, and enable access to various online
	  features. Information you give during registration online may
	  also be linked to your energy account information in our
	  system in order to provide you with simplified access to your
	  account information online, or to provide other services to
	  you related to your energy account..</p><p><b>(ii) Online Customer Care Features</b><br>
	  When using our online Customer Care Features we may ask for
	  your address and account number just as we would if we were
	  speaking to you over the phone or in person. We need to
	  collect such personal information in order to furnish you with
	  information about your account, generate reports based on your
	  account usage, and provide services tailored to your personal
	  account.</p><p>The following Customer Care areas of our site may involve
	  your giving us personal information to process your requests
	  and transactions:
	  </p><ul><li>EnergyTracker Online Reports<br></li><li>Energy In Business Online Reportss<br></li><li>Personal Energy Profile<br></li><li>Business Energy Profile<br></li><li>Voluntary Load Curtailment Service<br></li><li>Contractor Referral Services<br></li><li>Energy at Home e-Newsletter<br></li><li>Energy In Business e-Newsletter<br></li><li>Energy Efficient Services/Consulting
	  </li></ul><p><b>(iii) Surveys and Contests</b><br>
	  From time-to-time our site may request information from users
	  via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or
	  contests is completely voluntary and you have the choice
	  whether or not to disclose this information. Information
	  requested may include contact information (such as name and
	  shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip
	  code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify
	  the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used
	  for purposes of monitoring or improving the use of and
	  satisfaction with this site.</p><p><b>(iv) Special Offers</b><br>
	  We may send all new users a welcoming email to verify password
	  and username. Users may occasionally receive information on
	  products, services, special deals, and/or newsletters. Out of
	  respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to
	  not receive these types of communications (please see our
	  choices in the use and collection of information section
	  below).
	  </p><p><b>(v) Site and Service Updates</b><br>
	 We also send the user site and service announcement updates.
	  Users are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements,
	  which contain important information about the service. We also
	  communicate with the user to provide requested services and in
	  regards to issues relating to their account via email, phone,
	  or postal mail.</p><p><b>(vi) Nexus Energyguide</b><br>

	  On certain co-branded pages, Nexus Energyguide may collect
	  contact, demographic, energy use and other information from
	  you on behalf of PSE. This information may allow you to create
	  Energy Management Plans, sign up for electronic newsletters or
	  use other tools or services. All information collected by

	3. What Information is Shared with Third Parties?</h4><p>
	We will not sell, share, or rent your personal information to
	others in ways different from what is disclosed in this policy
	without first obtaining your authorization</p><p>We may disclose personal information you provide to
	independent contractors, service providers and consultants who
	are engaged by or working with PSE, consistent will all
	applicable laws and regulations. We may also use credit card
	processing companies to process payments for goods and services,
	outside shipping companies to ship orders and credit bureaus to
	check credit histories. We may partner with other parties to
	provide specific services and will share information with them
	in order to facilitate their provision of services. For example,
	when the user signs up for these services, we will share names,
	or other contact information necessary for the third party to
	provide these services. PSE may also contract with outside
	companies to administer our mailing lists or provide other
	services. Your personal information may be shared with an
	outside company for the sole purpose of administering the
	products, services and programs you have selected. PSE makes an
	effort to ensure, but does not guarantee, that all third party
	partners agree to the same high level of privacy safeguards that
	PSE itself provides to its users.</p><p>Additionally, we may share aggregated information (i.e.
	information we collect that does not allow you to be personally
	identified or contacted, for example demographic and site usage
	information) with third parties such as partners and advertisers
	without your authorization. This is not linked to any personal
	information that can identify any individual person.</p><p>As noted above, information collected by Nexus Energyguide on
	behalf of PSE on this Site or on co-branded pages is the sole
	property of PSE but may be used by Nexus Energyguide for the
	purpose(s) for which it was collected.</p><p>PSE reserves the right to share information with third
	parties if we are required to do so by law or if in our good
	faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply
	with the legal process, to respond to any claims, or to protect
	the rights of PSE, its customers, or the public..</p><p class="top"><a href="#content">Back to Top</a></p><br><h4><a name="link_4" id="link_4"></a> 
	4. What choices do I have in the use and collection of my information?</h4><p>
	Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their
	information used for purposes not directly related to our
	services at the point where we ask for the information. Users
	who no longer wish to receive promotional e-mail materials from
	PSE may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to
	the e-mail with "unsubscribe" in the subject line, or
	e-mailing <a href="mailto:customercare@pse.com">customercare@pse.com</a>
	and requesting to be taken off the list.</p><p class="top"><a href="#content">Back to Top</a></p><br><h4><a name="link_5" id="link_5"></a> 
	5. What security precautions are taken to protect my information online?</h4><p>PSE takes reasonable precautions to protect our users'
	information. Physical, electronic and policy measures are in
	place to minimize the loss, misuse, or altering of any
	information we receive from you. When you are asked to enter
	sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social
	security number), that information is encrypted and is protected
	with the advanced SSL encryption software. Encryption makes
	unauthorized access to the information much more difficult.</p><p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information
	online, we also take reasonable precautions to protect
	user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not
	just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in
	our offices. In fact, only certain employees are granted access
	to personally identifiable information. If you have any
	questions about the security at our Web site, you can send an
	email to <a href="mailto:customercare@pse.com">customercare@pse.comm</a>
	for more information.</p><p class="top"><a href="#content">Back to Top</a></p><br><h4><a name="link_6" id="link_6"></a>
