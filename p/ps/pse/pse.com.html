                In order to provide you with certain services on our Site, we
                may need to collect different types of information. In
                particular, we occasionally may need to collect certain types of
                personal information (information that may be used to personally
                identify or contact you) in order to provide you with particular
                features, services, or offers. Here's a summary of the kinds of
                information we collect at the PSE Site, and how we collect that
                information:<br>
                </p><blockquote>
                  <p><b>A. Passive Collection</b><br>
                  Our software automatically collects certain information from
                  your computer when you log on or move about our Site. This
                  information is not linked to any other personal information
                  you tell us, it just gives us a broad picture of who is on our
                  Site and which areas your users are visiting. It is our way of
                  learning whatâs important to our users and what isnât, and
                  improving our Site to make it more interesting and useful for
                  you. It also enables us to provide improved security and
                  efficiency on our Site. The two main ways in which this
                  general information is collected are through âlog filesâ
                  and âcookies.â</p>
                  <p><b>(i) Log Files</b><br>
                  Log files are records of user activity collected to analyze
                  trends, administer the Site, track userâs movement, and
                  gather broad types of information for aggregate use. The kinds
                  of general information we collect in the log files includes:
                  </p><ul>
                    <li>The IP address of your computer<br>
                    </li><li>How many people visit our Site<br>
                    </li><li>Which pages of our Site are visited most often<br>
                    </li><li>Which ISPs our visitors come from (e.g. AOL, MSN, etc.)<br>
                    </li><li>Which browsers users are used to visit our Site
                      (Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc.)<br>
                    </li><li>Time of day users visit our Site
                  </li></ul>
                  <p><b>(ii) Cookies</b><br>
                  PSE also uses âcookiesâ to gauge how users interact with
                  our Site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the userâs
                  hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies
                  cannot execute code or deliver a virus to your computer. Usage
                  of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable
                  information, it merely helps the Site to be more efficient.
                  Typically, a cookie enables your computer to load Web site
                  files faster on subsequent visits. We also use cookies to

                is Shared with Third Parties?</font><br>
                We will not sell, share, or rent your personal information to
                others in ways different from what is disclosed in this policy
                without first obtaining your authorization</p>
                <p>We may disclose personal information you provide to
                independent contractors, service providers and consultants who
                are engaged by or working with PSE, consistent will all

                outside shipping companies to ship orders and credit bureaus to
                check credit histories. We may partner with other parties to
                provide specific services and will share information with them
                in order to facilitate their provision of services. For example,
                when the user signs up for these services, we will share names,
                or other contact information necessary for the third party to
                provide these services. PSE may also contract with outside
                companies to administer our mailing lists or provide other
                services. Your personal information may be shared with an
                outside company for the sole purpose of administering the
                products, services and programs you have selected. PSE makes an
                effort to ensure, but does not guarantee, that all third party
                partners agree to the same high level of privacy safeguards that
                PSE itself provides to its users.</p>
                <p>Additionally, we may share aggregated information (i.e.
                information we collect that does not allow you to be personally
                identified or contacted, for example demographic and site usage
                information) with third parties such as partners and advertisers
                without your authorization. This is not linked to any personal
                information that can identify any individual person.</p>
                <p>As noted above, information collected by Nexus Energyguide on
                behalf of PSE on this Site or on co-branded pages is the sole

                PSE takes reasonable precautions to protect our users'

                place to minimize the loss, misuse, or altering of any

                sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social
                security number), that information is encrypted and is protected
                with the advanced SSL encryption software. Encryption makes
                unauthorized access to the information much more difficult.</p>
                <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information
                online, we also take reasonable precautions to protect
                user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not
                just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in
                our offices. In fact, only certain employees are granted access
                to personally identifiable information. If you have any

                email to <a href="mailto:customercare@pse.com">customercare@pse.com</a>
