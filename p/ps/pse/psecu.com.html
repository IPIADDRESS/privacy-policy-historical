      <dd>
        <p>The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act sets specific requirements for financial institutions to protect customer-member nonpublic personal information. It also required NCUA to issue regulations to implement its provisions. As a result, NCUA issued Part 716 of its Rules and Regulations entitled Privacy of Consumer Financial Information. This requires all federally insured credit unions to comply with NCUA’s Part 716 of its Rules and Regulations.</p>
<p>In compliance with Congress’ requirement that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers/members and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers/members’ nonpublic personal information, the Board of Directors of the Pennsylvania State Employees Credit Union (PSECU) has adopted the following Privacy Policy, which is further detailed in PSECU’s privacy notice (See Attachment A).</p>
<p>The Privacy Officer, who is the Corporate Compliance Officer, is responsible for the overall effectiveness of the Privacy program and works in conjunction with all PSECU staff to ensure compliance. </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><a name="B"></a>B. Goals:</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The specific goals of the Privacy Act Policy are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To  provide internal controls for ongoing compliance.</li>
          <li>To  have a written board approved privacy policy.</li>
          <li>To  provide privacy notices to all members initially and annually.</li>
          <li>To  designate an individual who will be responsible for overall effectiveness to  ensure compliance.</li>
          <li>To  determine if and what information is shared to any party not affiliated with  the PSECU.</li>
          <li>To  provide an opportunity for members to “opt out” of information sharing.*</li>
          <li>To  provide initial training and ongoing training as needed.</li>
          <li>To  provide annual independent testing for compliance. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><small>* PSECU does not share member nonpublic personal information; therefore an opt out option is not necessary.</small></p>
      </dd>
      <dt><a name="C"></a>C. Internal Controls:</dt>
      <dd>

              <li>PSECU  designated the Corporate Compliance Officer as Privacy Officer, who is  responsible for the overall effectiveness and PSECU's adherence to the Privacy  Act. </li>
              <li>All  third party contracts are required to include a confidentiality clause, if any  member nonpublic information is available to that third party. </li>
              <li>All  requests for member information are granted only by the member's written  permission, court order, subpoena, or government enforcement authority. </li>
              <li>PSECU's  Staff Development sends a refresher on the Privacy Policy once a year to all  employees. </li>

      <dd>
        <p>PSECU's  mission is <em>"To continually  strive to maintain a progressive and financially stable credit union that gives  PSECU members control over their finances. To provide members with a variety of  high quality traditional and innovative financial products and services, which  are convenient, with superior pricing and available through self-service  delivery channels."</em></p>
        <p>PSECU uses  the latest technology to deliver our products and services to all members,  which often translates into use of the various technologies for service  delivery. PSECU's primary delivery channel is the Internet. A logical concern  arising from the rapidly changing world of technology and specifically the  Internet is your right to conduct business with us in confidence and your right  to maintain privacy over your financial matters. </p>
        <p>We, the  Board of Directors, want to assure our members that we share your concern.  PSECU is committed not only to providing you with the most efficient services,  but also to ensure that all business you conduct with us is held in the  strictest confidence and that your transactions are safe and secure. PSECU is  committed to continually earning the faith and trust you, our members, have  placed with us. We value that faith and trust, and take it very seriously.  Therefore, we submit to you our pledge of that commitment, through the adoption  of our Privacy Policy. </p>
        <p>PSECU's  Privacy Policy and practices concern the personal information we collect and  disclose about our members. It also includes information about third parties  who may receive personal and sometimes nonpublic information from us as we  conduct the business of the credit union. PSECU and its affiliates follow these  practices; therefore, this notice will be applied to all. </p>
        <p>PSECU will  not sell and/or disclose any of your personal information to any mailing lists  or to any merchants. We are in the business of serving our members and not  marketing those lists to merchants. PSECU will not engage in the business of  unsolicited e-mail (spam). However, we may use e-mail to communicate with you  when necessary regarding new services or matters concerning your accounts with  us, or news about the credit union. </p>
        <p>In  addition, the Board of Directors has adopted a Confidentiality of Member  Information Policy. This policy is distributed to all staff. The policy  basically states that any information disclosed to PSECU in the course of  PSECU's business will be held in the strictest of confidence. Unauthorized or  illegal disclosure of your private information is considered a policy violation  and subjects the guilty party to discipline. Employees are reminded that their  responsibility to maintain this privacy continues even after their employment  ends. </p>
        <p>We invite  you to review our Privacy Policy and contact us with any questions you may  have.</p>

      <dt><a name="01"></a>Our Policy Regarding the Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Information</dt>
      <dd>
        <p> <strong>What Information We Collect...</strong><br>
          We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Information  we receive from you on applications and other forms.</li>
          <li>Information  about your transactions with our affiliates or us.</li>
          <li>Information  obtained when verifying the information you provide to us. This may be obtained  from your current or past employers, or from other financial transactions,  credit reporting agencies, and other sources.</li>
          <li>We  also collect information for non-member pre-approved mailings. This may be  obtained from credit reporting agencies and other sources.</li>
          <li>We  may disclose all of the information we collect, as described by law. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What Information We Disclose...</strong><br>
          We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to the following types of third parties: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Financial service providers</strong>, such as insurance companies,  mortgage service companies, and broker-dealers.</li>
          <li><strong>Non-financial companies</strong> , such as consumer reporting  agencies, data processors, check printers, financial statement publishers,  retailers, plastic card processors, and government agencies (with court  orders/subpoenas/member written consent), or any third party with a valid court  order, warrant or subpoena. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We share  this information only to help us in providing services to members and as  permitted or required by law. PSECU and its affiliates may also work closely to  offer products and services to meet member needs. PSECU's affiliates are either  wholly owned or controlled by PSECU. As a result, we may also share member  nonpublic personal information with each other as permitted by law.</p>
        <p><strong>To Whom We Disclose Information...</strong><br>
        In order  for us to conduct the business of running the credit union, we may disclose all  of the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform  marketing or other services on our behalf or to other financial institutions  with whom we have joint marketing agreements so that we may continue to provide  our member competitive products and services. We may also disclose nonpublic  personal information about you under circumstances as permitted or required by  law. </p>
        <p>To protect  our member's privacy, we only work with companies that agree in writing to  maintain strong confidentiality protections and limit the use of the  information we provide. </p>
        <p><strong>Disclosure of  Information about Former Members...</strong><strong><br>
          </strong>If you terminate your membership with PSECU or  its affiliates, we will not share information we have collected about you,  except as permitted or required by law.</p>

      <dt><a name="02"></a>Confidentiality and Security of Your Information</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Some of the  measures PSECU established to protect your personal financial information are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>PSECU  employees are governed by various policies that include the Code of Conduct,  Confidentiality of Member Information policies and Information Security  policies. These policies include the responsibility to protect the  confidentiality of members' financial and other personal information. This  prohibits your credit union Board and Staff from disclosing your personal  financial information. This prohibition is in place even after the employment  or board relationship is terminated or ends. </li>
              <li>PSECU  is subject to several examinations of our financials, records, policies and  procedures. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and the National Credit  Union Administration (NCUA), both perform examinations. In addition we have an  outside independent accounting firm conduct an annual audit. PSECU also maintains  a professionally trained Internal Audit staff to provide ongoing monitoring of  our system of control. </li>
              <li>PSECU  protects and secures both member and employee information at its facility by  restricting access to sensitive areas. Electronic badges and PINs are required  to gain access to the internal PSECU areas. Additionally, procedures and  electronic monitoring are in place in the event of unusual activity, robbery,  or fire. We continually evaluate our current physical security measures and  monitor new technology as it develops. </li>
              <li>PSECU  has extensive computer system security controls. Our operational and data  processing functions are in a secure environment that protects member  information from being accessed inappropriately. Our employees have limited access  to member information based on their job function. We maintain physical,  electronic, and procedural safeguards. Employees are educated on implementing  PSECU's policies and security principles and practices. </li>
              <li>PSECU  has sophisticated online banking and Internet security measures in place. </li>
            </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt><a name="03"></a>Fair Credit Reporting Act Disclosure</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>We currently do not share credit report  information about our members with our affiliates or any other third party. The  use of your credit report information is for internal use only such as  determining credit or service approval, other services and employment. </p>

      <dd>
        <p>PSECU recognizes the importance of maintaining a  presence on the World Wide Web for informational and e-commerce purposes in  both attracting new members and retaining existing members. For the purpose of  this statement, e-commerce is defined as the ability of members to access  personal account information and general credit union information, to initiate  transactions on your credit union accounts, and to apply for additional credit  union products and services online, and to access credit union approved vendor  sites to conduct credit union related business. Our privacy policy is the same  whether you are online or not.</p>

      <dt><a name="05"></a>Visiting Us  Online</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>We may  gather information about which sites our visitors browse while they are on any  PSECU owned site or affiliated site. This enables us to track how a visitor  navigates through the site areas in which they show interest. We gather  information such as number of hits to the site, page visits, and length of user  sessions. This is similar to a traffic report: it tracks trends and behaviors  of members/users in general, but does not identify individuals in particular.  We use this information to better serve you and it helps keep our site relevant  and useful.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><a name="06"></a>Our Use of  Cookies</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Cookies are  small text files assigned and attached by a Web server to the directory file on  your PC. Cookies help Web sites recognize return visitors. So, when you return  to a Web site that you have visited before, your browser gives this data back  to the server. PSECU uses cookies to make your online experience easier and  more personalized. As a matter of security, we do not embed your Social  Security number, account numbers, password, or other personal information in  our cookies.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><a name="07"></a>Our Use of Banners  and What They Are</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>A banner is  an electronic advertisement that is attached to a Web site. Some are  interactive and some just scroll. By interactive we mean that if you click on  the banner you can be directed to another site. We allow banners on our website  only from third parties that we approve. Sometimes, these ads or banners may  contain small graphics with tags in them. These tags tell us how many people  respond to those ads. They do not identify you personally. Instead these tags  are used to measure the effectiveness of those ads. They also help us market  our products and services to you.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><a name="08"></a>Online Security</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>We will  maintain industry standard security controls to ensure that member information  stored in our files and on the computers are protected. Where appropriate, we  will use security-coding techniques, like encryption, to protect against  unauthorized access and the integrity of communications and transactions, and  protect member confidentiality. PSECU uses 128-bit encryption technology, the  strongest industry standard encryption available as of October 2007.</p>
      <p>We also use  firewalls to secure your information. A firewall is a security measure that insulates  the credit union's computer network from the World Wide Web. PSECU analyzes  traffic coming into and out of our firewalls, which would indicate hacking  activity and other computer threats. We also regularly monitor our logs and  scan our systems for known vulnerabilities. PSECU contracts with third party  security specialists to regularly penetrate our network and to evaluate the  security of our online banking application. PSECU has implemented layered  security within psecu@home®. Layered security provides an additional means of  authentication beyond traditional user names and passwords.&nbsp; Further, PSECU's on-line presence is subject  to regular reviews and tests by independent security providers.</p>

      <dt><a name="09"></a>Protecting Children's Online Privacy</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>PSECU does  not knowingly collect, nor is our Web site designed or directed, to use  personal information from children under the age of 13 without containing  verifiable consent from their parents. We do offer a Planet M section on our  Web site that children can access site games, information and access to other  sites that are age-appropriate. Should a child whom we know to be under the age  of 13 send personal information to us, we will only use that information to  respond directly to that child, seek parental consent or provide parental  notice.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><a name="10"></a>Links We Have for  Non-PSECU Sites</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>PSECU does  have links on our Web site to other vendors and third parties. These links are  added to give you opportunities to participate with that vendor or third party  to take advantage of their services or products. We cannot guarantee how these  third parties use or collect personably identifiable information about you. We  urge you to review the privacy policies of each of the linked Web sites you  visit. PSECU requires strict confidentiality from any vendors or third parties  we associate with, but cannot control every aspect of their business.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><a name="11"></a>How You Can Limit Us  from Sharing Information</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>PSECU does  not disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third  parties, except as previously noted. In the unlikely event that this policy  would change, we will provide you an opportunity to “opt out.” This means that  before we would release any information of a nonpublic, personal, financial  nature to any nonaffiliated third party, you will have the chance to tell us  not to release it. We will provide to you the exact means of opting out, which  will be by writing us, phoning us or e-mailing us. You may opt out at anytime  if the need would arise. The opt out by law will not apply to disclosures that  are legally permitted or disclosures we make available to companies that  perform services on our behalf or to other financial institutions that have  joint marketing agreements with us.</p>
        <p>Once we  would receive your request, we will have a reasonable amount of time to stop  the disclosures. You may always contact us for assistance if you wish to later  revoke your opt-out election.</p>
        <p>PSECU has  an e-mail marketing service. PSECU will periodically send e-mails promoting our  products and services, or those of our affiliates, to members for whom we have  recorded e-mail addresses. All members who receive the marketing e-mails will  have the opportunity to opt out of this service at any time by simply clicking  the unsubscribe button. As always, all members can opt out by contacting us  using the methods described in this policy.</p>

      <dt><a name="12"></a>What You as a Member Can Do to Help</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>PSECU is committed to protecting the privacy of  our members. Members can help by following some simple suggestions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Protect  your account numbers, plastic card numbers, PINs and passwords. Never keep your  PIN with your card.</li>
          <li>Use  caution when disclosing your account numbers, Social Security numbers, etc. to  other persons. If you receive a telephone call from someone claiming to be from  the credit union, and that unknown person asks for account numbers, or other  identifying information, do not give that information.</li>
          <li>PSECU  staff will have access to your information and will not need to ask for it. <br>
          Keep your information with us current. If your address or telephone number  changes, please let us know promptly. It is important that we have current  information as to how to reach you. If we detect potentially fraudulent or  unauthorized activity or use of an account, we will attempt to contact you  immediately.</li>
          <li>After  you complete your online session, log out of psecu.com before surfing other  sites. It is suggested that you do not surf other sites during your online  banking session. As this could allow a cookie to be attached and possibly compromise  your information.</li>
          <li>Review  your account statements as soon as possible after receiving them. Contact us  immediately regarding any discrepancies.</li>
          <li>Let us know if you have any questions concerning this notice or  your account or any services we provide. Please do not hesitate to contact us.  We are here to serve you! </li>
