				<b>Our Secure Ordering:</b> PSSL.com uses Secured Sockets Layer 
				(SSL) technology to ensure the privacy of your personal information. 
				When you make an online purchase, our advanced security technology 
				encrypts and scrambles your personal data (including your name, 
				delivery and e-mail addresses and credit card number) before it 
				is sent to us, making it virtually impossible for anyone other than 
				us to read it. To further protect your information, we utilize state 
				of the art back-end systems and restrict employee access to your 
				information. Unless specifically authorized by you, no outside party 
				is able to access or receive any of your personal customer information.
				<br>
				<br>
				To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit 
				personal financial information, look at the lower left or right 
				corner of your browser, or to the right of the location bar in newer 
				browsers. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending 
				upon your browser), the SSL is active. To double-check for security, 
				look at the location line or your browser. If you have accessed 
				a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line 
				should change from "http" to "https.". If for any reason you cannot 
				access the secure server, please feel free to place your order with 
				us by phone at 1-800-268-5520. It is important for you to protect 
				against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. 
				Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. PSSL.com 
				wants you to feel completely comfortable. If you have more questions 
				about our security systems, or feel more comfortable ordering by 
				phone, please call 1-800-268-5520 and we will be happy to help you.
