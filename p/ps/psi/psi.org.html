        We collect an IP address from all visitors to our Site. An IP address 
        is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use

        Cookies are pieces of information that some Web sites transfer to the

        purposes at many Web sites. Use of cookies makes Web-surfing easier by

        preferences regarding your use of the particular Web site and to make 
        sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. Many consider the use of cookies
