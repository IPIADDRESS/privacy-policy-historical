Please see information about our cookie policies in Section VII.B for further details.</li>
<li><strong>Cookies</strong> – Cookies are small data files that a website sends to your Device while you are viewing the website that are stored on the Device. Cookies can be used for many purposes, including to monitor use of websites, to customize content specific to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, to speed up your searches and purchases and to recognize you when you return to websites and/or store your user name and password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit websites. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Websites, Services, or our content may not function properly.</li>
<li><strong>P</strong><strong>ixel Tag</strong> – Pixel Tags (also referred to as clear GIFs, 1×1 GIFs Web beacons, or Web bugs) are small graphic images or other web programming code that may be included on the Websites, Services, and in our e-mail messages. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s Device, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel Tags may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a pixel tag. Pixel Tags or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Websites, to monitor how users navigate the Websites or use the Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</li>

<p id="IV">IV.&nbsp;<strong>T</strong><strong>HIRD-PARTY ANALYTICS PROVIDERS &amp; AD SERVERS; ONLINE TRACKING</strong></p>
<p>PSafe works with certain third parties (including network advertisers, ad agencies, and analytics companies) to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Services, to serve advertisements, including our advertisements elsewhere online, and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. These third parties may use Device Identifier and Usage Data to compile reports on user activity. For example, if you clicked on one of our advertisements that led you to our Websites or Services, our service provider(s) may be able to tell us which advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement. These third parties may set and access their own tracking technologies (including cookies, embedded scripts, and pixel tags) and may otherwise collect or have access to your Device Identifier, Usage Data and related information about you. Cookies and pixel tags, including those set by third-party network advertisers, may be used to, among other things, target advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you, and assist in providing analytics.</p>
<p>These third parties may also transfer Device Identifier and Usage Data to other third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process analytics information on their behalf. Each of these third party’s ability to use and share Device Identifier and Usage Data is restricted by their respective Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. By using our Services, you consent to the processing of data about you by these third parties in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For a full list of third-party analytics services, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@psafe.com">privacy@psafe.com</a>.</p>
<p>We may share Device Identifier and Usage Data about visitors with third-party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors to help analyze how users use the Websites and Services. These analytics services may use their own software development kits (SDKs) to collect information such as how often and what features of the Websites and Services users use. We use this information to improve the Websites and Services. The analytics services’ ability to use and share information collected by them is restricted by their respective terms of use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information about how these entities use this information, and how you can opt-out of their use of such information.</p>
<p>While we may use a variety of service providers to perform advertising and analytics services, some of these companies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.</p>

<p><strong>C.&nbsp;</strong><strong>COOKIES </strong><br>
A cookie is a data file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiration date, unless deleted by the user before the expiration date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but Personal Information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.</p>

Users of&nbsp;<em>dfndr vault</em> who accept your invitation to view such Shared Content (or the user who posted the Shared Content, if re-downloading to their own device) automatically will receive a download (in their <em>dfndr vault</em> application) of the shared files in their original sizes.</p>

Nevertheless, the user agrees that PSafe is not responsible for the misuse of the user’s personal information by these companies or websites. In some cases, these service providers collect information directly from the user (for example, in the case of purchases through app stores, or requests to conduct surveys or studies). In such cases, the user will receive a notification about the participation of a service provider in such activities and the user will have complete discretion over what information the user wants to provide.

<p>As described in the License Agreement, certain Services allow you to “connect” such Services to an account with the following third-party cloud storage providers: Dropbox, Google, and OneDrive (each, a “Third-Party Cloud Storage Provider”). You agree that the information and/or Personal Information you provide to activate and/or use the connection to the Third-Party Cloud Storage Provider, as well as any content or data you have chosen to store (which may include Personal Information) using the Services, may be shared with that Third-Party Cloud Storage Provider.

This automatic replication can be disabled – and replicated files can be deleted from PSafe’s servers – by the user at any time in the <em>dfndr vault</em> settings.</p>
<p><em>Promotions or Contests</em></p>
<p>Winners of any commercial promotions and/or contests conducted by PSafe, or people who participate in PSafe’s loyalty programs, expressly authorize PSafe to share their names, personal data provided to PSafe to participate in the promotion, contest or program, and images (photos), in the ways it sees fit, for the purpose of advertising and/or promotion, without the right to any compensation.</p>
<p><strong>C.&nbsp;</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>HARING BETWEEN PSAFE COMPANIES; BUSINESS TRANSFERS</strong><br>
We may share and disclose some or all of users’ Personal Information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Information may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding users’ Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. These transfers and disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.</p>

<p>You also may contact support@psafe.com to register an “opt-out” request that removes your email from visibility in Identity Theft Report searches, rather than permanently deleting it (to ensure that if the email address appears in information from subsequent Data Breaches obtained by PSafe, it does not become searchable again); note that an email address which is subject to an “opt-out” request may remain searchable if you complete a standard email verification process related to that specific email address.</p>
