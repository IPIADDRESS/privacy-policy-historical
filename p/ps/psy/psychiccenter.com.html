						<b>I. TYPES OF DATA WE COLLECT</b>
						<br><br>We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit our Sites, when you send us information or communications, and/or when you use our Offerings. "<b>Personal Data</b>" means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. "<b>Anonymous Data</b>" means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. We may also collect or develop aggregated information, which may include Anonymous Data and Personal Data, provided that such information does not personally identify you or any of our other users ("<b>Aggregated Data</b>"). We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below. 
						<br><br>
						<b>II. DATA WE COLLECT</b>
						<br><div style="padding-left:15px"> 
							<p><b>A.	Personal Data That You Provide to Us.</b>  In order to provide you with personalized services and features we ask you to register and establish your personal profile ("<b>Profile</b>"). During the registration process we will ask you for Personal Data such as your name, telephone number, gender, birth information, e-mail address, password, place of residence, zip code, etc. This Personal Data is used to customize the Offerings to you and to provide you with personalized service. Depending on the part of the Offerings you are accessing, you may be asked at various times, for example, by filling out a form or survey, to provide Personal Data such as name, gender, e-mail address, birth date, and birth location.  Personal Data is collected primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our Offerings.
							<br><br><u>Orders</u>
<br>If you purchase a service from us, we request certain personal data from you during the account creation process. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).  

<br><br>We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.
<br><br>

							
							</p><p><b>B.	Personal Data Collected via Technology.</b>  To make our Offerings more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect Personal Data from you, including browser type, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.  Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit our Sites.  
							</p><p><b>C.	Personal Data That We Collect from You About Others.</b>  If you decide to submit information about a third party, we will collect the third party's Personal Data in order to personalize the Offerings for such third party. You or the third party may contact us to request the removal of this information from our database, by sending us an email to delete@horoscope.com which indicates for which email address you would like us delete information.
							</p><p><b>D.	Advertising.</b>  If there is advertising on the Sites, such advertising may employ the use of cookies or other methods to track hits and clickthroughs. We are not responsible for advertiser cookies or how the information gathered through their use might be used.
							</p><p><b>E.	Children.</b> We do not intentionally gather Personal Data from users who are under the age of 13.
						</p></div><br>
						<b>III.	USE OF YOUR DATA</b>
						<br><div style="padding-left:15px"> 
							<p><b>A.	General.</b>  In general, Personal Data you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. We use your Personal Data (i.e., e-mail address, gender, and password) to personalize our Offerings; to deliver personalized information to you; to send you administrative e-mail notifications, such as security or support and maintenance advisories; to respond to your questions should you ask an advisor a question; to provide you with electronic newsletters; and to send you special offers related to our Offerings and for other marketing purposes of Horoscope.com. Your e-mail address together is used to secure your Profile and to make our personalized e-mail services available to you. 
							</p><p><b>B.	Creation and Use of Anonymous and Aggregated Data.</b>  We may create Anonymous Data and Aggregated Data from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that make the data personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Data and Aggregated Data for trend analysis, and to better understand patterns of usage so that we may enhance the content of our Offerings and improve Site navigation. We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data and Aggregated Data to third party companies in our discretion.
