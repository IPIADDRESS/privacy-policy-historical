             What data is being collected and by who?
          </h2>
        <p>
           
          
My website is personally hand coded and owned by myself, I collect 2 pieces of information on visting my pages: <br><br>
-	IP address: This is used to identify the connection you use to access my site<br>
-	Referrer URL: which possibly tells me how you found your way to my site (if available)<br><br>
This information is deleted after 7 days - purged without any backups being kept - and is used for engagement and abuse detection purposes, <br>
IP address is stored un-masked so I can determine who is potentially abusing my website and block their access if necessary, <br><br>
Details such as name, address and telephone number are not requested for input anywhere on my website<br><br>
I am also partnered with Google Adsense, who use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to this websites,    and any other participating websites. 
          <br> Any potential third party advertisers who serve ads through this platform can collect information in ways in which I cannot control such as storing previous browsing history and creating personal profiles based on your website history.
</p>
      <h2>	What is my reason for processing this data? </h2>
The reason I collect data is to monitor where and how my website is being accessed <br><br>
      while my website is incredibly streamlined and almost all text based HTML pages - there are some people who feel the need to attempt various malicious attacks.
      While these attacks have little to no effect on my site, 
      I choose to block these offenders regardless to ensure a seamless experience for others visiting. <br><br>
Google's use of advertising cookies enables itself and its partners to serve ads to your users based on visits to this site and/or other participating sites.

      <h2>	Will the data be shared with any third parties? </h2>
No data collected by myself will ever be shared with any third parties unless there is a regulatory requirement to do so. Keeping in mind that data is automatically deleted once it is 7 days old.
Advertisers may collect additional data through personalized advertisements served on this site, this information â€“ such as previously visited websites - is not collected by me and may be shared from those third parties with other third parties.

      <h2>	How long will the data be stored for? </h2>
All data collected by me is stored for 7 days and deleted, there are no backups of this data. 

I do not have visibility on the data that third party advertisers collect or how long they store such data 

      <h2>	How can the data subject raise a complaint? </h2>
If you have any concerns you can contact me through any of the methods on my contact page
