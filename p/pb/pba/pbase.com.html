<p><b>PBase Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p>Here's a privacy policy. They seem fun and trendy, so PBase wanted one too.<br>
I believe it is all common sense and there should be no surprises. -slug</p>

<p><b>What This Privacy Policy Covers</b></p>

<p>This privacy policy covers how PBase treats personal information that PBase collects and receives, including information related to your use of PBase services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.</p>

<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that PBase does not own or control, or to people that PBase does not employ or manage.</p>

<p><b>Information Collection and Use</b></p>

<p><b><i>General</i></b></p>

        <li>To fulfill your requests for products and services;

        </li><li>To contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.
		</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b></p>

<p>PBase does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with PBase under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help PBase communicate with you about offers from PBase and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
</li><li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
</li><li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of PBase' terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
</li><li>We transfer information about you if PBase is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, PBase will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
</li></ul>

<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
<ul>
