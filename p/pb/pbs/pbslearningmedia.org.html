<h3><a name="disclosure"></a>Disclosure of Information</h3>
<p>We may share information that is collected from you in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>- <strong>Authorized third-party service providers.</strong> In certain cases, we contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf. We may share your information with these companies that provide services to us, including companies that assist with business analytics, data processing, account management, and other services. These service providers may maintain customer databases with e-mail addresses of Site visitors who have provided them to us by registering at our Site or signing up for e-mail alerts. We (along with our service providers) will use these addresses to respond to the general purposes for which we collected the information, to provide services, and to operate the Site, including to respond to inquiries and for e-mail distribution, list processing and analysis, and promotions management. Our service providers have access to your information as necessary to provide certain services on our behalf. They are required to maintain the privacy of all such information in their possession or control, and can only use the information on our behalf for the purpose that we have contracted them, for example sending you a newsletter. They are not authorized to use your information for any other purpose. We will not share your e-mail address with any other unaffiliated organization unless otherwise described below.</li>
<li>- <strong>PBS Member Stations.</strong> We have partnered with certain PBS member stations to offer localized versions of the Site. In such cases, we may share information we collect about you with the PBS member station whose localized version of the Site you visited. You can tell when you are visiting a localized version of the Site because the top banner on the Site will reflect the localization. The member station may use this information to provide you with information about its services that might interest you.</li>
<li>- <strong>Business transfers.</strong> We may share your information in connection with a substantial business transaction, such as the sale of the Site, a merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</li>
<li>- <strong>Legal requirements, safety, and security.</strong> We, and our service providers, may disclose your information when we have a good faith belief that it is necessary to: detect, prevent, and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves and you from violations of our Terms of Use; to prevent death or imminent bodily harm; and to otherwise protect and defend our or our users’ legal rights, interests, property, and safety.</li>
<li>- <strong>With your consent.</strong> We otherwise may share your information with your consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also may share aggregated or anonymized information with third parties, including to help us develop content and services that we hope you will find of interest or to help these third parties develop their own products and service offerings. This sharing of anonymized or aggregated information will not include information that could be used to individually identify you.</p>
<h3>Protection of Information</h3>
<p>We are committed to protecting your information. We have adopted commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and physical procedures to help protect your information from loss, misuse, and alteration.

<li>- <strong>Collection.</strong> Users must be at least 13 years old to register for the Site. A state department of education, school district, homeschooler, or school teacher or administrator may create accounts for students under the age of 13. In such circumstances, we may collect personal information from students for the use and benefit of the school. In addition, these educational agencies or institutions may act as agents for parents in providing consent for our online collection, use, and disclosure of students’ personal information within the school context. For example, we may collect personally identifiable information, such as full name and e-mail address, from children to facilitate their use of online lesson plans and other communications posted through interactive features on the Site, such as community forums. As described above in the section on <a href="/help/privacy-policy#collection">Collection of Information</a>, we also may automatically collect certain information from children when they visit our Site.</li>
<li>- <strong>Use and disclosure.</strong> We may use and disclose children’s personally identifiable information for the purposes and in the manners described above in the sections on <a href="/help/privacy-policy#use">Use of Information</a> and <a href="/help/privacy-policy#disclosure">Disclosure of Information</a>.</li>
<li>- <strong>Access.</strong> State departments of education, school districts, homeschoolers, and school teachers or administrators may request to review the personal information of their students who are under the age of 13, to have this information deleted, or to refuse to permit further collection or use of their students’ personal information by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:LearningMediaContact@pbs.org">LearningMediaContact@pbs.org</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use of Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>
<p>Cookies are small amounts of data that are stored in separate files within your computer’s Internet browser. Cookies are accessed and recorded by the websites you visit so they can recognize the same browser navigating online. We use cookies to help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting the Site; to help us customize the content you are shown while visiting the Site; and to help measure and research the effectiveness of our interactive online content, features, and other communications.</p>
<p>We also may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and similar technologies, to track your use of the Site. Web beacons (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an e-mail. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. We use these technologies to improve your experience on the Site, including to provide you with content customized to your interests and to understand whether users read e-mail messages and click on links contained within those messages so that we can deliver relevant content and offers.</p>
<h3>External Links and Third-Party Content</h3>
<p>We enable you to access third-party content through the Site and to navigate to third-party sites and services from links on the Site. Whether the third-party content appears within our Site (such as in an embedded video player) or you leave our Site to view the content on another website, the third party is in control of and independently produces, maintains, and monitors the content and third-party sites. When you watch third-party content that is made available through the Site or navigate to such third-party sites, you become subject to the third party’s terms of use and privacy policies.
