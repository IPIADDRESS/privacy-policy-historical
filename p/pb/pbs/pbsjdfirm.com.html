        1. Information that we collect about you</b></p>
      <p><b>PBS&amp;J designs web sites that may collect and maintain certain 
        personal information about you when you send us email or complete any 
        of our online forms such as Feedback or Contact Us. This personal information 
        can identify you and your business individually, and may include items 
        such as your name and email address, job title, company name and address, 
        phone number, web site address and contact details of the Web Site Administrator.</b></p>
      <p><b>PBS&amp;J also collects, or logs, certain other information that cannot 
        personally identify you when you visit our Web Site. This information 
        includes your Internet Protocol ("IP") address and your domain 
        name. Your IP address is the number that is automatically assigned to 
        your computer by the ISP computer through which you access the Web and 
        your domain name is the name of the ISP computer itself through which 
        you access the Web.</b></p>
      <p><b>PBS&amp;J logs these IP addresses and domain names and aggregates 
        them for system administration and to monitor the use of our site. We 
        use the aggregated information to measure the number of visits to our 
        site, the average time spent on our site, the number of pages viewed, 
        and various other site use statistics. This monitoring helps us to evaluate 
        how our Web Site is used and to continuously improve the content we provide. 
        While we may report aggregated IP address information to the Client who 
        is paying for the Web Site hosting service, PBS&amp;J does not link IP 
        addresses or domain names with any personal information that can be used 
        to identify the User. This means that a visitor's session will be logged 
        on our servers, but the visitor will always remain anonymous.</b></p>
      <p><b>PBS&amp;J does not purchase or otherwise obtain any supplemental personal 
        information about you from any third parties.</b></p>

      <p><b>2. Ways we collect information about you</b></p>
      <p><b>When you visit our Web Site, certain technical information (IP address 
        and domain name) is automatically collected. We cannot use this technical

        to us via the Feedback Form, Contact Us form or other similar questionnaires.</b></p>
