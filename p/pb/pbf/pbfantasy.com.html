   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <p>
   This privacy policy discloses what information PBFantasy gathers and how PBFantasy uses it.
   Please read this privacy policy before using PBFantasy ("the Site") or submitting any personal
   information. By using the Site, you are accepting the practices
   described in this privacy policy.
   </p>
   <p>
   <span class="biggerText">COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   PBFantasy collects personally identifiable information, like names, birth date,
   gender, email addresses, etc., when voluntarily submitted by our visitors
   during registration. PBFantasy also collects information on our server logs from
   your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page
   you request. The information you provide is used to fulfill you specific request.
   </p>
   <p>
   <span class="biggerText">USE OF INFORMATION</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   PBFantasy uses any information you voluntarily provide to enhance your
   experience in our network of Sites, whether to provide interactive or
   personalized elements on the Sites or to better prepare future content
   based on the interests of our users. The Site may use cookie and tracking
   technology depending on the features offered. Cookie and tracking technology
   are useful for gathering information such as browser type and
   operating system, tracking the number of visitors to the Site,
   and understanding how visitors use the Site. Cookies can also help
   customize the Site for visitors. Personal information cannot be
   collected via cookies and other tracking technology, however,
   if you have previously provided personally identifiable information, cookies may
   be tied to such information. Aggregate cookie and tracking
   information may be shared with third parties.
   </p>
   <p>
   PBFantasy uses tracking information to determine which areas of our Sites
   users prefer like based on traffic to those areas. PBFantasy does not
   track what individual users read, but rather the overall performance
   of each page. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.
   PBFantasy creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns
   for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to
   advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements
   that are pertinent to their needs. Because PBFantasy does not track the usage
   patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know
   that a specific user clicked its ad. 
   </p>
   <p>
   <span class="biggerText">SHARING AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   PBFantasy uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your
   needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics.
   This is essential in keeping our service free. PBFantasy does not share information
   about individual users with any third party, except to comply with
   applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal
   safety of our users or the public. PBFantasy may share information with
   governmental agencies or other companies assisting us in
   fraud prevention or investigation. PBFantasy may do so when: (1)
   permitted or required by law; or, (2) trying to protect against or
   prevent actual or potential fraud or unauthorized transactions; or,
   (3) investigating fraud which has already taken place. The information is
   not provided to these companies for marketing purposes.
   </p>
   <p>
   <span class="biggerText">CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   PBFantasy operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall
   and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are
   periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. Only authorized
   employees, agents and contractors (who have agreed to keep information
   secure and confidential) have access to the information provided by our users.
   </p>
   <p>
   <span class="biggerText">CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</span>
   </p>
   <p>
   PBFantasy reserves the right to make changes to this policy. Any changes to this
   policy will be posted and changes will only apply to activities and
   information on a going forward, not retroactive, basis.
   You are encouraged to review the privacy policy whenever you visit the
   Site to make sure that you understand how any personal information you
   provide is used.
