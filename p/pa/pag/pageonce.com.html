          <h3>Pageonce Privacy Policy</h3>

        <p>Last Updated: 09/09/08</p>

        <p>Pageonce is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of personal information about our current and prospective users.
          We are proud of our privacy practices and want you to know how we protect your personal information and use this protection to service your account.
          We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing personal information with us. You do not have to contact us to benefit from Pageonce's privacy protections;
          they apply automatically to all of our users.</p>

        <p>
          <a href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.pageonce.com&amp;sealid=101" target="_blank">
          <img src="i/truste_seal_ctv.gif" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 20px; float: right;" alt="TrustE">
        </a>
        </p>

        <p style="margin-right:90px">Pageonce is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.
          This privacy statement covers the site <a href="http://www.pageonce.com">www.pageonce.com</a>. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy,
          it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>

        <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact <a href="mailto:privacy@pageonce.com">privacy@pageonce.com</a>.
          If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at
          <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php" target="_blank">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>.
          TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.</p>



        <ul class="privacy">
		<li>Information we collect</li>
        <p>
          Pageonce collects the following categories of personal information about you through the Pageonce Service:
        </p>

        <p>Registration Information: When you register for the Pageonce Service, you will be asked for basic registration information,
          such as a user name and password which you choose, and an e-mail address for Pageonce support. You may also enter in certain passwords and user names for third party sites and services.
          We will use this information for providing the services and accessing the web sites you select on your behalf, so that we can present the requested information to you.</p>

        <p>Information from Third Party Web Sites: In order to display information to you through the Pageonce Service, the Service must collect, on your behalf,
          your account and other personal information from third party web sites and Internet services that you register on the Pageonce Service.
          For example, if you register your Netflix account with Pageonce, we will aggregate your Netflix information on our web site in order to present it to you.</p>


        <li>Protecting the information we collect:</li>

        <p>We use firewall barriers, SSL 128-bit encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of your online session and to protect Pageonce accounts and systems from unauthorized access.
          We may also place cookies and similar files on your hard drive for purposes such as security, to facilitate site navigation, and to personalize your experience on our Site.
          Our cookies do not identify you by name as an individual or by account number except as described in this privacy policy. See our ?Cookies? section below for more information.</p>

        <li>Using the information we collect</li>

        <p>We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs,
        and services, to respond to your inquiries about our services, and to offer you other products, programs or services
        that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>

        <p>We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our services,
          and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>

        <p>We may use or disclose your information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>

        <p>If we believe it is necessary, we will share your information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,
          situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or the security of our network or services, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.</p>

        <p>We may transfer your information to a third party in connection with a sale or acquisition of Pageonce or substantially all of its assets.</p>

        <p>Pageonce may aggregate transaction data and disclose such data only in aggregate and in a non-personally identifiable manner to third parties for marketing and promotional purposes
          (e.g. how many users responded to a particular offer). Aggregated information does not identify any User individually.</p>

        <p>We use information about which links have been followed and whether action has been taken on another party's web site to improve our offerings and to customize the Service.</p>

        <p>When you visit our Site, we may collect technical and navigational information, such as computer browser type, Internet protocol address, pages visited, and average time spent on our Web Sites.
          This information may be used, for example, to alert you to software compatibility issues, or it may be analyzed to improve our Web design and functionality.</p>


        <li>"Opt-Out" Emails </li>
        <p>Pageonce.com complies with the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003. Pageonce provides periodic site notifications, newsletters or other information via email.
          Users may elect to stop receiving such messages at their discretion. If you no longer wish to receive periodic email updates from Pageonce, please send an email to <a href="mailto:optout@pageonce.com">optout@pageonce.com</a>.
          You may also follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each promotional email. Our service-related emails do not have the ability to opt-out.</p>


        <li>Collection Of Information By Third-Parties And Sponsors</li>

        <p>Our Site contains links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>

        <p>Our Site may contain third party advertisements or offers that are complementary to your use of Pageonce. If you choose to use these separate products or services, disclose information to the providers,
          and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy. You should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services.</p>

        <p>We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities. For example, these service providers may help us measure the performance of our online promotions or determine web site activity.
          We do not share any personally identifiable information about our users with these third parties, and these third parties do not collect such information on our behalf.</p>

        <li>Cookies</li>

        <p>To enhance your experience with our Sites, many of our web pages use "cookies". Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences.
          Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at our Site.
          However, once you choose to furnish the Site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our Site.
          For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our site (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site), and to save your password in password-protected areas. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.</p>

        <li>No Guarantees</li>

        <p>While this Privacy Statement expresses Pageonce's standards for maintenance of private data, Pageonce is not in a position to guarantee that the standards will always be met.
          There may be factors beyond our control that may result in unintentional disclosure of data. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
          Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <li>Ownership of data </li>

        <p>Your data belongs to you, and you can remove it anytime you want. If you ask us to delete your account, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove your data from our servers.
          Despite such removal, portions of your data may remain on our production and back-up servers indefinitely.</p>

        <p>Any personally identifiable information you submit on a blog, bulletin board or chat room on this Site can be viewed and used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.
          Pageonce is not responsible for your disclosure of information in these forums.</p>

        <li>Changes to this policy</li>

        <p>reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this Privacy Policy. You may review updates to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy at any time via links on our Site. You agree to accept electronic communications and/or postings of an annual or revised Privacy Policy on the Pageonce web site, and that such electronic communications or postings constitute notice to you of the Privacy Policy.  We reserve the right to modify this policy from time to time, so please review it frequently.
          If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>
