		</p><h1><strong><u>Theme Your World LLC Privacy Policy</u></strong></h1>
	<p></p>
	<p>
		<strong>1. INTRODUCTION</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong></strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Theme Your World LLC (the "Company," "we" or "us") operates <a href="http://www.pagerage.com" target="_blank">www.pagerage.com</a> (the "Site"). The Company's products and services include the downloadable
		browser add-on "PageRage" (the "App"). The App, and any other applications, products, services, features, content, promotions or games offered from
		time to time by the Company on the Site or otherwise in connection with its business shall be referred to herein as the "Services". The Company is
		based in the United States and the Services are hosted in the United States.
	</p>
	<p>
As set forth in the Company's Terms of Service currently available at		<a href="http://www.pagerage.com/TermsOfService.aspx">http://www.pagerage.com/TermsOfService.aspx</a>, the Services are general audience, are not
		targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected
		personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that might have any information
from a child under age 13, please contact us through our support page		<a href="http://www.pagerage.com/Troubleshooting.aspx">http://www.pagerage.com/Troubleshooting.aspx</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including those who use the Services without being registered with the Company and those who have registered
		with any Company Service. This Privacy Policy describes the Company's collection and use of users' personal information (e.g., information that
		identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address) where that information is not otherwise publicly available on the Services. We also
		describe generally the Company's practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the
		extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account. Your access to and use of certain Services may require you to accept
		additional terms and conditions or a privacy policy applicable to such Services.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>2. SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>User Submitted Information</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Registration Information</strong>
		is the information that users must provide to the Company upon registration for certain Services (e.g., your user name, email address, and account
		password.)
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Public Information and Posts</strong>
		consist of comments or content that you may post to the Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, such as a user
		name and/or user picture. Public Information and Posts will always be public, which means it will be available to everyone and will be displayed in
		search results both on the Services and on external search engines.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Third Party Information and Content. </strong>
		If you access the Services through a third party connection or log-in, your user submitted information may also include your user name associated with
		that third party service, any information or content you have permitted the third party to share with the Company, and any information you have made
		public in connection with that third party service (collectively, "Third Party Information and Content"). Third Party Information and Content obtained
		in this manner will be governed by this Privacy Policy and the terms and conditions applicable to use of the Services. In addition, the Company may
		supplement the information we collect with information we obtain from third parties to improve the quality of the Services.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Collected Information</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Transactional and Site Activity Information. </strong>
		When users access the Services, we collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits for marketing purposes. For example, in
		order to permit your connection to the Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, operating system and browser,
		including your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Services from a mobile or other device, we may
		collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Tracking Technologies.</strong>
		The Company may use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology), which are comprised
		of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and
		then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. These
