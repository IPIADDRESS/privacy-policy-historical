<h2>Cookies and IP Addresses</h2>When you visit one of our websites, we
may send you a cookie. A cookie is a small file wich is placed on your
computer or device.<br>
1. Essential Cookies<br>
These cookies are essential for the running of our websites. Without
the use of these cookies parts of our websites would not function. For
example The Times paywall uses cookies to help us identify which of our
readers have a subscription in order to access paid for content held on
the website.<br>
2. Analytical Performance Cookies<br>
We use these types of cookies to monitor our websites performance and
how their users may use it. These cookies provide us with information
that helps us provide better products to their users and also to
identify any areas that may need maintenance. For example, we use
performance cookies on The Sun's website to provide the most popular
news articles further up the page of the website.<br>
3. Functional Cookies<br>
Functional cookies are used to remember your preferences on our
websites. This can be anything from remembering your city in a weather
forecast or saving your username.<br>
4. Behavioural Advertising Cookies/Third Party Cookies<br>
We, and our advertisers/sponsors, may use cookies to provide tailored advertising to you which we believe are relevant to you.<br>
Online behavioural advertising is a way of providing advertisements on
the websites you visit and making them more relevant to your interests.
This is done by grouping together shared interests based upon previous
web browsing activity. Advertising is then displayed to you when you
visit a website which matches these interests.<br>
Behavioural advertising is based upon your web browsing activity over a
period of time - so it's different to advertising you may see when
you're looking for something online using a search engine (eg Google)
or on the website you may be visiting at a particular time.<br>
As an example, you may be doing research in order to buy a bicycle and
read a number of different articles on a number of different websites.
If a bicycle manufacturer was part of an advertising network, they may
think that you are interested in buying a bicycle and serve you with
one of their adverts for one of their bicycles. It is possible that
from reading these articles elsewhere, you would see this advert on one
of our or someone else's websites.<br>
We cannot control nor do we have access to any cookies placed on your
computer by third party advertisers and sponsors. Audience Science, who
generate these cookies have their own privacy policy at <a href="http://www.revenuescience.com/privacy.asp">http://www.revenuescience.com/privacy.asp</a><br>
We may also track IP addresses. <br>
<br>
<h2>How to control the use of cookies</h2>You are not obliged to accept
cookies and may modify your browser so that it will not accept cookies.
The browser you use to surf the web not only allows you to see the
cookies that you have got but also allows you to control their use.<br>
You can control them by allowing them, deleting them individually or
deleting all of them. You can also set your browser to not accept
cookies altogether. If this option is selected, you should be aware
that many websites will not function properly or at all. It may be
possible to set your browser to not accept cookies and ask for your
consent before each cookie is set on your device. This gives you
control over what is set on your device, however has the drawback of
slowing down your browsing experience.<br>
There are different levels of control too. You are able to prevent just
third party cookies being deployed, effectively opting out of
behavioural advertising, and some even allow you to block specific
companies you do not wish to deploy a cookie, instead of selecting all
companies.<br>

personalised content as outlined in the section Personalised content.<h2>Device Identifiers</h2>
	<p>Our
Apps require access to the following services on your mobile device:
UDID, MAC address, or other applicable device identifier. We send this
information to our servers for the purpose of validating free trials.
We do not share this information with any 3rd parties.</p>

prevent the use of such activities, please see our <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cookies, and IP Address section.</span><h2>Consent</h2>By completing our registration forms with personal information or by the continued use of our services, you are consenting to:<br>
<br>

of the European Economic Area which may not provide the same level of
data protection as the UK. If we do make such a transfer or if your
personal information will be processed outside of the European Economic
Area, we will put a contract in place to ensure your information is
protected or where applicable covered by the US "Safe Harbor Program".<br>
<br>
<h2>Marketing consent</h2>If you are an existing customer we will keep you informed of product developments that relate to these products and services.<br>

Please note: Many products or services include personalised
communications as part of their package; users will be given the
opportunity to control the receipt wherever possible. In the event that
the product or service consists entirely of communication (e.g
editorial bulletins) this may take the form of unsubscribing from the
specific communication.<br>
If you purchase or redeem an offer with us, we may need to disclose
your personal information to our partners, suppliers and subcontractors
in order to process your order, fulfil deliveries, complete billing and
invoicing transactions and to inform delivery and logistics planning.<br>
We may supply personal data to trusted suppliers for analysis purposes.
This will be done under agreement with us and will be in line with this
policy.<br>
We will work with other companies for promotional purposes where
readers may be asked to opt in for future contact from that specific
partner. With your permission we will transfer that customer data to
the third party at which point it will fall under their own privacy and
security controls. Members of the News Corp UK &amp; Ireland Limited
group of companies cannot be held liable for subsequent issues arising
from third party usage of transferred data.<br>
<br>
<h2>Disclosure</h2>
	<p>Your personal information will be disclosed
where we are obliged or permitted by law to do so. If you post or send
offensive or objectionable content anywhere on or to any of our
websites or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on any of our
websites, we can use the information that is available to us about you
to stop such behaviour. This may involve informing relevant third
parties such as your employer and law enforcement agencies about the
content and your behaviour.</p>

data will be used to take payment for products and services and may be
used to verify credit details related to this payment. Permission to do
so is implicit in providing financial details to process payment.
Direct Debit information may be retained for ease of renewal of
services.<br>
<br>
If you apply for credit then to help us to make credit decisions about
you, to prevent fraud, to check your identity and to prevent money
laundering, we may search the files of credit reference agencies who
will record any credit searches on your file. We may also disclose
details of how you conduct your account to such agencies. The
information will be used by other credit grantors for making credit
decisions about you and the people with whom you are financially
associated for fraud prevention, money laundering prevention and
occasionally for tracing debtors.<h2>Updating or deleting your personal information profile</h2>When
you register online with a News UK group company, you can see, review
and change your personal information by logging onto the website and
going to "My Profile" or equivalent. Please ensure you update your
personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Should you request
that your account is closed and your personal information removed,
please be assured that this will be done as soon as is reasonably
possible. Personal information from closed accounts is retained in
order to comply with legal obligations, prevent fraud, collect any fees
owed or to resolve disputes.<br>
<br>
Personal, transactional and behavioural information will be stored
against your personal profile. If you do not use your account or
interact with us, then your profile will be held for three years and a
further two years in an anonymised form for analysis purposes. It will
then be securely deleted.<br>
<br>

example through the use of polls, comments, text messages, email,
phone, radio or letters we reserve the right to display this content
indefinitely in any relevant context subject to our editorial
judgement. This will be anonymised in the case of testimonials or
customer service conversations.<br>

you submit in social media including chat rooms, blogs and forums will
be viewed by other people. As such, this personal data may be viewed,
collected and used by third parties over whom we have no control. We
are not responsible for either the information you submit/post or
otherwise make available in such public areas or any use that may be
made of such information by any third party.<br>

they have appointed you to act for them, to consent to the processing
of their personal data, including sensitive personal data and to the
transfer of their information abroad and to receive on their behalf any
data protection notices.<br>
When you request to have your profile removed from further marketing
offers from us, you will be added to a suppression list to ensure your
request is complied with.&nbsp;<h2>Information Requests</h2>
	<p>You
have a right to ask for a copy of your personal information from any
News Corp UK &amp; Ireland Limited group company which may hold about
you (for which we charge a small processing fee) and to ask us to
correct any inaccuracies in your personal information (which is free).

service to you through training of our staff, we may monitor or record
telephone calls.</p>
