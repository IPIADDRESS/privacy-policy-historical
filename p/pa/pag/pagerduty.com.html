        Your privacy is critically important to us. At Synchronicity Labs we have a few fundamental principles:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
          (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
        </li>
        <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law,
          develop our products, or protect our rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the
          on-going operation of one of our services.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>

      <p>
        <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" rel="license"><img border="0" align="right" src="http://creativecommons.org/images/public/somerights20.png" alt="Creative Commons License"></a>
        (We'd very much like to thank the people at <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">Automattic Inc.</a>
        who were kind enough to offer their Privacy Policy to the world under the
        <strong>Creative Commons Sharealike</strong> license.
        Our privacy policy is a close derivative of their work.
        We're therefore pleased to make our policy available under the same terms.)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Synchronicity Labs Inc. (“Synchronicity Labs”) operates several websites including pagerduty.com.
        It is Synchronicity Labs policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
        while operating our websites.
      </p>

      <h3>Website Visitors</h3>

      <p>
        Like most website operators, Synchronicity Labs collects non-personally-identifying
        information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
        language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
        Synchronicity Labs' purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
        understand how Synchronicity Labs’ visitors use its website. From time to time,
        Synchronicity Labs may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate,
        e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Synchronicity Labs also collects potentially personally-identifying information
        like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Synchronicity Labs does not use such information
        to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the
        same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
      </p>

      <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

      <p>
        Certain visitors to Synchronicity Labs' websites choose to interact with
        Synchronicity Labs in ways that require Synchronicity Labs to gather
        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
        Synchronicity Labs gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
        For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at pagerduty.com to
        provide a company name and an email address. Those who engage in transactions with
        Synchronicity Labs – by purchasing access to the PagerDuty monitoring aggregation and alarming service,
        for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and
        financial information required to process those transactions. In each case,
        Synchronicity Labs collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill
        the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Synchronicity Labs.
        Synchronicity Labs does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
        And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
        information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
      </p>

      <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

      <p>
        Synchronicity Labs may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.
        For instance, Synchronicity Labs may monitor the most popular monitoring systems used by 
        customers when interfacing on the pagerduty.com site. Synchronicity Labs may display this
        information publicly or provide it to others. However, Synchronicity Labs does not disclose
        personally-identifying information other than as described below.
      </p>

      <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

      <p>
        Synchronicity Labs discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
        information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that
        (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Synchronicity Labs’ behalf or
        to provide services available at Synchronicity Labs' websites, and
        (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
        contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country;
        by using Synchronicity Labs' websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
        Synchronicity Labs will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
        information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
        as described above, Synchronicity Labs discloses potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when
        Synchronicity Labs believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary
        to protect the property or rights of Synchronicity Labs, third parties or the public at large.
        If you are a registered user of an Synchronicity Labs website and have supplied your email address,
        Synchronicity Labs may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features,
        solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Synchronicity Labs
        and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information,
        so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request
        (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms),
        we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to
        help us support other users. Synchronicity Labs takes all measures reasonably necessary to
        protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
      </p>

      <h3>Cookies</h3>

      <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and 
        the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
        Synchronicity Labs uses cookies to help Synchronicity Labs identify and track visitors,
        their usage of Synchronicity Labs website, and their website access preferences.
        Synchronicity Labs visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers
        should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Synchronicity Labs' websites,
        with the drawback that certain features of Synchronicity Labs' websites may not function
        properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

      <h3>Ads</h3>

      <p>
        Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners,
        who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time
        they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.
        This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements
        that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by
        Synchronicity Labs and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
      </p>

      <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

      <p>
        Although most changes are likely to be minor, Synchronicity Labs may change its
        Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Synchronicity Labs' sole discretion.
        Synchronicity Labs encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
        Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute
        your acceptance of such change.
