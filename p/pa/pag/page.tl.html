    		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    		<p>On this website you will find webme GmbH's Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy has been designed to inform you and notify you of the kinds of personal data we collect, process and use, and in which ways and for what purposes we do that.</p>
    		<p>The protection and security of your personal data is of prime importance to us. Your personal data will be treated in accordance with the applicable data protection laws.</p>
    		<p>You can access the Privacy Policy at any time at <a href="http://www.own-free-website.com/en/Privacy-Policy.php" title="Privacy Policy">http://www.own-free-website.com/en/Privacy-Policy.php</a>. For a printer-friendly version of the Privacy Policy please click <a href="http://www.own-free-website.com/en/docs/Privacy-Policy.pdf" title="PDF Download">here</a>.</p>
    		<h3>1. Collection, Processing and Use of Personal Data</h3>
    		<p>We will collect, process and use personal data beyond the scope already permitted by law and without your required further consent only to the extent necessary for the conclusion and execution of a contractual relationship or for billing purposes. Generally, the following master data will be used for conclusion and execution of a contractual relationship: Title, name, date of birth, gender, address, phone number, fax number, email address, banking connection, sums payable, and payments including information on the posting date.</p>
    		<p>Usage data, such as information regarding start and end dates and the scope of the use of certain services and/or communication data will only be collected, processed and used if this is necessary to make available and invoice such services. Generally, the type of the service, and, in as far as enabled by the respective service, start and end date and time of use, the volume in bytes and your IP address are stored.</p>
    		<p>In performance of our service we may disclose data to our contracting partners (e.g. web hosters).</p>
    		<h3>2. Domain Registration</h3>
    		<p>Please note: In case of domain registrations we disclose certain personal data to registrars and registering organizations. Such data will be stored by the registering organizations and published in Whois databases, where they will be basically accessible to anyone. As an example, when registering a ".de"-domain, currently the name and the address of the domain owner, the administrative and technical contact person and the zone manager, as well as phone and fax numbers and email addresses of the administrative and technical contact person and the zone manager will be disclosed to and stored by DENIC e.G. Name and address will be accessible via the Whois-query on the internet. For .com-, .net- and .org-domains, for example, also the phone and fax number as well as the email address of the administrative contact person will be disclosed and made accessible to anyone in the Whois-databases.</p>
    		<h3>3. Billing Purposes</h3>
    		<p>We may disclose billing data to third service providers and/or third parties to the extent necessary for determination of charges and billing. Billing data will be stored for a maximum of six months after the invoice has been sent - only if you object against the invoice or fail to pay despite having received a notice to pay we may keep your billing data for a longer period (in the event that data must be stored to comply with statutory, constitutional or contractual retention periods, such data will be blocked).</p>
    		<h3>4. Just in Case</h3>
    		<p>To protect your personal data collected and processed by us from unauthorized access and abuse, we have put a number of technical and organizational security measures in place. These security measures are monitored on a regular basis and updated according to technical progress as necessary.</p>
    		<p>As provided for by applicable provisions we are entitled to disclose and submit data for criminal prosecution and risk prevention purposes.</p>
    		<h3>5. Cookies &amp; Co.</h3>
   			<p>From time to time, we are using so called "cookies". Cookies are (very) small text files placed by the server on your computer to make access to a website more simple, effective and safe. With the help of these cookies, you can be identified during the time of your visit. Data submitted to the server by your browser will be collected and automatically stored in the server statistics. These data include information on your IP-address (by which your computer can be uniquely identified), the type and the version of the browser you are using, your operating system, the referrer URL and the time of the server request. Such information will generally be used by us in anonymized form, e.g. for statistic analyses to help us optimize our services.</p>
   			<h3>6. Anonymized Profiles</h3>
   			<p>To enable us to evaluate, improve and market our services we use anonymized user profiles which will, however, not be analyzed with specific regard to individual persons. Information cannot be tracked back to an individual user. You may object to the creation of such a user profile at any time with future effect. Please find our contact details for notifying us accordingly below.</p>
   			<h3>7. Necessary Amendments</h3>
   			<p>We reserve the right to modify or amend this Privacy Policy with view to the provision of new services, if and to the extent necessary. The same applies if the current Privacy Policy is found to contain any gaps. Upon such amendment, we will contact our Users by email sent to the email address provided to us.</p>
   			<h3>8. Contact and Notices</h3>
   			<p>In compliance with legal requirements we will at any time provide you with information on your personal data stored by us, free of charge and without undue delay.
