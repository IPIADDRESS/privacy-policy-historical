			<p></p><h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
<strong>Information Collection and Use </strong><br>
PageWash.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.  PageWash.com collects information from our users at several different points on our website.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates.  For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.  The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.  For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly Drawings that take place. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 
</p>
<p>
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers).  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Log Files</strong><br>
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sharing</strong><br>
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Surveys &amp; Contests</strong><br>
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Children</strong><br>
Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online.  PageWash.com encourages parents to take an active role in their children's use of the Internet and to spend time online with their children.  PageWash.com will use its best efforts not to collect personal information for those identifying themselves as age 17 or under.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Site and Service Updates</strong><br>
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</strong><br>
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.  This can usually be done at the member information page or by contacting <a href="contact.html">Customer Support</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Choice/Opt-out </strong><br>
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
