If the need arises, we may suspend access to our site, or close it indefinitely. Any of the material on our site may be out of date at any given time, and we are under no obligation to update such material. 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR LIABILITY 9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The material displayed on our site and any content you may access or download is provided without any guarantees, conditions or warranties as to its accuracy. To the extent permitted by law, we other members of our group of companies and third parties connected to us hereby expressly exclude: 9.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All conditions, warranties and other terms which might otherwise be implied by statute, common law or the law of equity. 9.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any liability for any direct, indirect or consequential loss or damage incurred by any user in connection with our site or in connection with the use, inability to use, or results of the use of our site, any websites linked to it and any materials posted on it, including, without limitation any liability for: (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss of income or revenue; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss of business; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss of profits or contracts; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss of anticipated savings; (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss of data; (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss of goodwill; (g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wasted management or office time; (h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and any other loss or damage of any kind, however arising and whether caused by tort (including negligence), breach of contract or otherwise, even if foreseeable. 9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This clause does not affect our liability for death or personal injury arising from our negligence, nor our liability for fraudulent misrepresentation or misrepresentation as to a fundamental matter, nor any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PURCHASING ITEMS THROUGH THE WEBSITE 10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where we provide you with an opportunity to purchase items such as t-shirts, CDs, merchandise (&quot;Physical Goods&quot;), or digital goods such as music downloads &nbsp;(&quot;Digital Goods&quot;), then you shall need to do so via our third party fulfilment partners (&quot;e-Shop Providers&quot;). 10.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may be required to register an online account with the e-Shop Providers to purchase the Physical Goods or Digital Goods and you should therefore read carefully any terms of use and privacy policies you may be required to agree to before your purchase. 10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The terms of use of the e-Shop Providers shall govern your consumer rights in respect of your purchase, and shall also detail how the contract to purchase the goods shall be formed. For the avoidance of doubt, the e-Shop Providers shall be responsible for fulfilment of any order you place. 10.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that Digital Goods by their nature cannot be returned if you later change your mind so please ensure you really do wish to purchase the goods before you complete the transaction online. 10.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on your local jurisdiction and the contract between you and the e-Shop Providers, you may have certain rights to return Physical Goods. 10.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your Physical Goods are delivered faulty to you then you should contact the e-Shop Providers to notify them of your concerns and to arrange where applicable a return and/or refund. In some instances you may be entitled to a ‘cooling off period' where you buy Physical Goods online. This is currently, within the EU, a period of seven days from when you receive the Physical Goods to decide whether you wish to keep the goods. The e-Shop Provider will be responsible for notifying you further of these rights. When you return Physical Goods you are encouraged to do so via registered post so as to have proof that you returned the goods. Any damage you cause to the Physical Goods in your possession may invalidate any rights you have to receive a refund. You should therefore examine the Physical Goods immediately when you receive them to ensure you want to keep them. Any worn items of clothing may not returned if they are not in a resalable condition. 10.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you purchase CDs or DVDs then you may not be able to return these items during any ‘cooling off period' if you remove any packaging or seal around the items. 10.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that any goods offered for sale or for download via our website are offered for sale to consumers only for their private, non commercial use. All prices quoted on our site shall include VAT (where applicable). 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AND YOUR VISITS TO OUR SITE 11.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We process information about you in accordance with our Privacy Policy. By using our site, you consent to such processing and you warrant that all data provided by you is accurate. 11.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that information you post in your profile page will be viewable by other people. In addition, certain functionality of our site (such as playlists and tour information) will also be made available to other users to view so as to create a real online fan community.

You warrant that any such contribution does comply with those standards, and you indemnify us for any breach of that warranty. 12.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any material you upload to our site will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary, and we have the irrevocable and perpetual right to use, copy, distribute and disclose to third parties any such material for any purpose. We also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any material posted or uploaded by you to our site constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights, or of their right to privacy. 12.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will not be responsible, or liable to any third party, for the content or accuracy of any materials posted by you or any other user of our site. 12.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have the right to remove any material or posting you make on our site, and the right to monitor any communications you make via the site. 12.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where required by law we will retain copies of any communications you may make via the site, and reserve the right to share such material with law enforcement agencies. 13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MODERATION OF COMMENTS AND MATERIAL 13.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that we do not actively moderate comments or other content which users may submit to our site. We rely upon community moderation of our site, and provide users with a way of flagging up inappropriate comments or material on our site. As a result, care should be taken when allowing minors to use our site. 13.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall examine carefully a comment or other material which a user notifies us as being inappropriate, and we shall exercise in our discretion our right to remove such content. 14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY The following provisions set out our site's Acceptable Use Policy that you must comply whilst you use our site. 14.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROHIBITED USES 14.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may use our site only for lawful purposes. You may not use our site: (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any way that breaches any applicable local, national or international law or regulation. (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any way that is unlawful or fraudulent, or has any unlawful or fraudulent purpose or effect. (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purpose of harming or attempting to harm minors in any way. (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To send, knowingly receive, upload, download, use or re-use any material which does not comply with our content standards (see below). To transmit, or procure the sending of, any unsolicited or unauthorised advertising or promotional material or any other form of similar solicitation (spam). (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To knowingly transmit any data, send or upload any material that contains viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time-bombs, keystroke loggers, spyware, adware or any other harmful programs or similar computer code designed to adversely affect the operation of any computer software or hardware. 14.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You also agree: (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to reproduce, duplicate, copy or re-sell any part of our site in contravention of the provisions of our Terms of Website Use. (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to access without authority, interfere with, damage or disrupt: (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any part of our site including without limitation in any way that causes or is likely to cause, distress to any person, or for the purposes of spamming or sending unsolicited emails or messages; or (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any equipment or network on which our site is stored; or (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any software used in the provision of our site; or (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any equipment or network or software owned or used by any third party. 14.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INTERACTIVE SERVICES 14.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We (or our chosen partners) may from time to time provide interactive services on our site, including, without limitation: (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chat rooms. (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bulletin boards. (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E-postcards. (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Widgets – such as downloadable music players or newsfeeds. (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Music streaming services. 14.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical). The use of the applicable interactive service shall be governed by these terms and our Terms of Website Use unless where expressly set out to you. 14.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on our site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not. 14.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not foolproof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them. 14.2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise. 14.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONTENT STANDARDS These content standards apply to any and all material which you contribute to our site (contributions), and to any interactive services associated with it.

To the extent permitted by law, we other members of our group of companies and third parties connected to us hereby expressly exclude: 9.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All conditions, warranties and other terms which might otherwise be implied by statute, common law or the law of equity. 9.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any liability for any direct, indirect or consequential loss or damage incurred by any user in connection with our site or in connection with the use, inability to use, or results of the use of our site, any websites linked to it and any materials posted on it, including, without limitation any liability for: (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss of income or revenue; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss of business; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss of profits or contracts; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss of anticipated savings; (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss of data; (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss of goodwill; (g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wasted management or office time; (h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and any other loss or damage of any kind, however arising and whether caused by tort (including negligence), breach of contract or otherwise, even if foreseeable. 9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This clause does not affect our liability for death or personal injury arising from our negligence, nor our liability for fraudulent misrepresentation or misrepresentation as to a fundamental matter, nor any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PURCHASING ITEMS THROUGH THE WEBSITE 10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where we provide you with an opportunity to purchase items such as t-shirts, CDs, merchandise (&quot;Physical Goods&quot;), or digital goods such as music downloads &nbsp;(&quot;Digital Goods&quot;), then you shall need to do so via our third party fulfilment partners (&quot;e-Shop Providers&quot;). 10.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may be required to register an online account with the e-Shop Providers to purchase the Physical Goods or Digital Goods and you should therefore read carefully any terms of use and privacy policies you may be required to agree to before your purchase. 10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The terms of use of the e-Shop Providers shall govern your consumer rights in respect of your purchase, and shall also detail how the contract to purchase the goods shall be formed. For the avoidance of doubt, the e-Shop Providers shall be responsible for fulfilment of any order you place. 10.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that Digital Goods by their nature cannot be returned if you later change your mind so please ensure you really do wish to purchase the goods before you complete the transaction online. 10.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on your local jurisdiction and the contract between you and the e-Shop Providers, you may have certain rights to return Physical Goods. 10.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your Physical Goods are delivered faulty to you then you should contact the e-Shop Providers to notify them of your concerns and to arrange where applicable a return and/or refund. In some instances you may be entitled to a ‘cooling off period' where you buy Physical Goods online. This is currently, within the EU, a period of seven days from when you receive the Physical Goods to decide whether you wish to keep the goods. The e-Shop Provider will be responsible for notifying you further of these rights. When you return Physical Goods you are encouraged to do so via registered post so as to have proof that you returned the goods. Any damage you cause to the Physical Goods in your possession may invalidate any rights you have to receive a refund. You should therefore examine the Physical Goods immediately when you receive them to ensure you want to keep them. Any worn items of clothing may not returned if they are not in a resalable condition. 10.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you purchase CDs or DVDs then you may not be able to return these items during any ‘cooling off period' if you remove any packaging or seal around the items. 10.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that any goods offered for sale or for download via our website are offered for sale to consumers only for their private, non commercial use. All prices quoted on our site shall include VAT (where applicable). 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AND YOUR VISITS TO OUR SITE 11.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We process information about you in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
