OUR SITE CHANGES REGULARLY 8.1    We aim to update our site regularly, and may change the content at any time. If the need arises, we may suspend access to our site, or close it indefinitely. Any of the material on our site may be out of date at any given time, and we are under no obligation to update such material. 9.     OUR LIABILITY 9.1    The material displayed on our site and any content you may access or download is provided without any guarantees, conditions or warranties as to its accuracy. To the extent permitted by law, we other members of our group of companies and third parties connected to us hereby expressly exclude: 9.1.1   All conditions, warranties and other terms which might otherwise be implied by statute, common law or the law of equity. 9.1.2   Any liability for any direct, indirect or consequential loss or damage incurred by any user in connection with our site or in connection with the use, inability to use, or results of the use of our site, any websites linked to it and any materials posted on it, including, without limitation any liability for: (a)  loss of income or revenue; (b)  loss of business; (c)  loss of profits or contracts; (d)  loss of anticipated savings; (e)  loss of data; (f)   loss of goodwill; (g)  wasted management or office time; (h)  and any other loss or damage of any kind, however arising and whether caused by tort (including negligence), breach of contract or otherwise, even if foreseeable. 9.2    This clause does not affect our liability for death or personal injury arising from our negligence, nor our liability for fraudulent misrepresentation or misrepresentation as to a fundamental matter, nor any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. 10.    PURCHASING ITEMS THROUGH THE WEBSITE 10.1   Where we provide you with an opportunity to purchase items such as t-shirts, CDs, merchandise (&quot;Physical Goods&quot;), or digital goods such as music downloads (&quot;Digital Goods&quot;), then you shall need to do so via our third party fulfilment partners (&quot;e-Shop Providers&quot;). 10.2   You may be required to register an online account with the e-Shop Providers to purchase the Physical Goods or Digital Goods and you should therefore read carefully any terms of use and privacy policies you may be required to agree to before your purchase. 10.3   The terms of use of the e-Shop Providers shall govern your consumer rights in respect of your purchase, and shall also detail how the contract to purchase the goods shall be formed. For the avoidance of doubt, the e-Shop Providers shall be responsible for fulfilment of any order you place. 10.4   Please note that Digital Goods by their nature cannot be returned if you later change your mind so please ensure you really do wish to purchase the goods before you complete the transaction online. 10.5   Depending on your local jurisdiction and the contract between you and the e-Shop Providers, you may have certain rights to return Physical Goods. 10.6   If your Physical Goods are delivered faulty to you then you should contact the e-Shop Providers to notify them of your concerns and to arrange where applicable a return and/or refund. In some instances you may be entitled to a ‘cooling off period' where you buy Physical Goods online. This is currently, within the EU, a period of seven days from when you receive the Physical Goods to decide whether you wish to keep the goods. The e-Shop Provider will be responsible for notifying you further of these rights. When you return Physical Goods you are encouraged to do so via registered post so as to have proof that you returned the goods. Any damage you cause to the Physical Goods in your possession may invalidate any rights you have to receive a refund. You should therefore examine the Physical Goods immediately when you receive them to ensure you want to keep them. Any worn items of clothing may not returned if they are not in a resalable condition. 10.7   If you purchase CDs or DVDs then you may not be able to return these items during any ‘cooling off period' if you remove any packaging or seal around the items. 10.8   Please note that any goods offered for sale or for download via our website are offered for sale to consumers only for their private, non commercial use. All prices quoted on our site shall include VAT (where applicable). 11.

Any of the material on our site may be out of date at any given time, and we are under no obligation to update such material. 9.     OUR LIABILITY 9.1    The material displayed on our site and any content you may access or download is provided without any guarantees, conditions or warranties as to its accuracy. To the extent permitted by law, we other members of our group of companies and third parties connected to us hereby expressly exclude: 9.1.1   All conditions, warranties and other terms which might otherwise be implied by statute, common law or the law of equity. 9.1.2   Any liability for any direct, indirect or consequential loss or damage incurred by any user in connection with our site or in connection with the use, inability to use, or results of the use of our site, any websites linked to it and any materials posted on it, including, without limitation any liability for: (a)  loss of income or revenue; (b)  loss of business; (c)  loss of profits or contracts; (d)  loss of anticipated savings; (e)  loss of data; (f)   loss of goodwill; (g)  wasted management or office time; (h)  and any other loss or damage of any kind, however arising and whether caused by tort (including negligence), breach of contract or otherwise, even if foreseeable. 9.2    This clause does not affect our liability for death or personal injury arising from our negligence, nor our liability for fraudulent misrepresentation or misrepresentation as to a fundamental matter, nor any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. 10.    PURCHASING ITEMS THROUGH THE WEBSITE 10.1   Where we provide you with an opportunity to purchase items such as t-shirts, CDs, merchandise (&quot;Physical Goods&quot;), or digital goods such as music downloads (&quot;Digital Goods&quot;), then you shall need to do so via our third party fulfilment partners (&quot;e-Shop Providers&quot;). 10.2   You may be required to register an online account with the e-Shop Providers to purchase the Physical Goods or Digital Goods and you should therefore read carefully any terms of use and privacy policies you may be required to agree to before your purchase. 10.3   The terms of use of the e-Shop Providers shall govern your consumer rights in respect of your purchase, and shall also detail how the contract to purchase the goods shall be formed. For the avoidance of doubt, the e-Shop Providers shall be responsible for fulfilment of any order you place. 10.4   Please note that Digital Goods by their nature cannot be returned if you later change your mind so please ensure you really do wish to purchase the goods before you complete the transaction online. 10.5   Depending on your local jurisdiction and the contract between you and the e-Shop Providers, you may have certain rights to return Physical Goods. 10.6   If your Physical Goods are delivered faulty to you then you should contact the e-Shop Providers to notify them of your concerns and to arrange where applicable a return and/or refund. In some instances you may be entitled to a ‘cooling off period' where you buy Physical Goods online. This is currently, within the EU, a period of seven days from when you receive the Physical Goods to decide whether you wish to keep the goods. The e-Shop Provider will be responsible for notifying you further of these rights. When you return Physical Goods you are encouraged to do so via registered post so as to have proof that you returned the goods. Any damage you cause to the Physical Goods in your possession may invalidate any rights you have to receive a refund. You should therefore examine the Physical Goods immediately when you receive them to ensure you want to keep them. Any worn items of clothing may not returned if they are not in a resalable condition. 10.7   If you purchase CDs or DVDs then you may not be able to return these items during any ‘cooling off period' if you remove any packaging or seal around the items. 10.8   Please note that any goods offered for sale or for download via our website are offered for sale to consumers only for their private, non commercial use. All prices quoted on our site shall include VAT (where applicable). 11.
