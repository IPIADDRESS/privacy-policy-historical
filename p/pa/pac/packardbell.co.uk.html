Finally, Packard Bell BV may disclose personal information should Packard Bell BV be legally bound to do so (particularly following registration of a complaint). <br><br><u>THE RIGHT TO UPDATE, CORRECT OR DELETE PERSONAL INFORMATION</u> <br><br>In all cases and in accordance with current French legislation and more specifically with the law dated 6 January 1978, you have the right to consult, amend or contest your personal data. <br><br>Please send any requests and/or questions relating to your data record to the following address:<!--<BR>Packard Bell BV <BR>Nieuweweg 279,<BR>6600 AH Wijchen<BR>The Netherlands <BR><BR>---><br>Packard Bell BV <br>Jonkerbosplein 52<br>6534 AB Nijmegen<br>Po Box 6925<br>6503 GK Nijmegen<br>The Netherlands<br><br><u>THE RETENTION PERIOD FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION</u> <br><br>With the exception of any processing for historical, statistical or scientific purposes, your personal data shall not be retained in its nominal form for any longer than the period necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was requested. <br><br><u>SECURITY MEASURES</u> <br><br>Only those persons specifically authorised by Packard Bell BV have access to your information.
