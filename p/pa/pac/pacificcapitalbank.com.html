<b>IDENTITY SECURITY</b><br>
In an effort to protect you and our country, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act ("USA PATRIOT Act") was passed on October 26, 2001. Title III of the Act is applicable to all U.S. financial institutions and addresses money laundering and terrorist financing. The intent of the Act is to starve terrorists of funding for further actions against the United States, thereby helping to protect our country and citizens from further harm.  The USA PATRIOT Act requires banks to gather information to ensure that we identify our customers properly and to monitor account activity for possible funding of illegal operations.  These procedures are intended to protect banks and their customers from becoming a vehicle for, or a victim of, illegal activities. <br>
<br>
One particular section of the USA PATRIOT Act requires financial institutions to follow minimum account opening standards concerning the identity of the customer.  Procedures to ensure compliance with this requirement include; verifying the identity of the customer, maintaining records regarding the name, address and identifying information of the customer; and consulting lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations provided to the institution by the Federal Government.  <br>
<br>
What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.  Periodically thereafter, we may ask you to provide, or clarify, your identifying information.  In addition, our staff members may need to ask you additional questions about certain types of transactions or there might be certain forms you are requested to complete.  We apologize for any inconvenience to you, but we assure you, that we take every measure to protect your financial information, while complying with Federal regulations.  If you have any questions, please contact your Branch.  Thank you for selecting us to serve you and we appreciate your understanding and cooperation.<br>
