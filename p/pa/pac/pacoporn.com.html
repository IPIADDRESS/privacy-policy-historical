receive. We do not intend to collect any personal information from children under 
13 unless we believe such collection to be permitted by law. Please see below 
for our policy with respect to children under 13.</span>
<p><span class="black_regular1">General<br>
  We gather user information to provide you with a customized experience on our 
  site. Your user information helps us tailor the content, services, goods and 
  advertising to your current and future needs. For this reason, we may ask you 
  to register or to provide personal information when you post comments, enter 
  a contest, order products, subscribe to a newsletter and/or visit certain areas 
  of our site. If you choose not to register you may not have access to areas 
  that require personal identification.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">Use of Information<br>
  When you register, we ask for your e-mail address, a unique nickname selected 
  by you and other information. Once you are a registered user you can update 
  your profile and may be able to provide additional preferential information.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">All communication on the Internet takes place between pairs of IP Addresses. 
  Our Web servers will log the IP address that any connection is made from. We 
  may use these IP addresses to help diagnose technical problems or prevent abuse 
  of our systems or other site users. Your IP address may also be used to gather 
  aggregate demographic data and target advertisements accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">Your browser has options to accept, reject, or provide you with notice when 
  a cookie is sent. A cookie is a small line of text that is stored 
  with your Web browser for record-keeping purposes and to help us provide better 
  service to you. We use cookies to save your password (in an encrypted format) 
  on your machine so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our 
  site. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and 
  track your downloads and purchases from our site.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">Our site contains links, including banner and other ads, to other Websites. 
  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Websites. 
  Our site may also link to Websites that feature our trademarks and names along 
  with trademarks and names of other companies. You should look at the privacy 
  policy on that co-branded Website, as the co-branded Website may not be under 
  our control.<br>
  Applications you use or download from our site may contain third party digital 
  rights management systems (DRMS) which may allow for communication 
  between your software and the third party and utilize security features (e.g., 
  preventing distribution of or access to the applications in the event of unauthorized 
  use). These DRMS are subject to their own license agreements and you agree that 
  we shall not be responsible for any loss or damage of any sort relating to the 
  use of the DRMS or your dealings with such third parties. The applications may 
  also contain DRMS produced by us which allow for communication between the applications 
  you use or download and our systems and which collect information describing 
  your computer system in order to prevent illegal or unauthorized use of the 
  applications.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">For reasons such as improving member experience and providing customized communications 
  to our users, we may receive information about you from third party sources 
  and our web logs and add it to the information that we have received from you. 
  Web logs automatically record anything a web server sees, which may include 
  e-mail addresses you enter into a form or pages viewed by a user at a particular 
  IP address.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">Information Sharing<br>
  We will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties, 
  aside from entities that perform services for us, such as fulfilling orders 
  or processing payment, that either are bound to comply with our privacy policy 
  or have privacy policies that protect your information unless you have opted-in 
  to such sharing. If you have previously opted-in to such sharing under a prior 
  privacy policy version, you are still considered to have opted-in under this 
  privacy policy. As stated, and whether or not you have opted-in, we may use 
  third parties to accept and process orders for merchandise and products, including 
  software, and such third parties may get access to your personal information 
  for the purposes of providing services or products to you on our behalf. In 
  addition, if you opt-out, we may share that information with third parties who 
  send e-mails on our behalf so that they do not e-mail you.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">However, we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law 
  or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply 
  with the law or with legal process served on us; (2) protect and defend our 
  rights or property; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">We may request demographic information from you (for example, your age, education 
  level or household income) from time to time. We will not share that information 
  in a manner that identifies you as an individual with any other entity, unless 
  we let you know that at the time of collection or we have your permission. When 
  we share demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate 
  information only.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">In the event that we acquired by another company, your personal information 
  may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">Opt-Out<br>
  If you provide us with your e-mail address, and do not opt-out of receiving 
  e-mail from us, we may e-mail you with information, including information about 
  selected third parties. If you do not want to receive information from us, you 
  may decline to receive it (or Opt-Out) either when you provide 
  personal information to us or you may update your profile. You may also choose 
  to Opt-Out from certain types of e-mail by following the unsubscribe instructions 
  that appear on each newsletter. You may also contact us as provided below. Please 
  note that there might be a brief delay between when you submit your request 
  to opt-out and when it is processed and reflected in our systems; accordingly 
  you might continue to receive e-mails from us for a few days after you unsubscribe. 
  We maintain records of those users who opt-out of specific e-mail options so 
  that we do not e-mail them with respect to those types of e-mails, and we may 
  share this information with third parties who send e-mails on our behalf so 
  that they do not e-mail you; this information may also be contained in web logs 
  (see above).</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">Children Under 13<br>
  Our site is not directed to children under the age of 13. We assume products 
  purchased through credit card means are purchased by adults. We respect the 
  privacy of parents and children and are committed to complying with the Children's 
  Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). On those areas of the sites that ask 
  for age, we do not collect personal information from individuals who identify 
  themselves as under the age of 13 except in those limited circumstances where 
  we believe that such collection is permitted under COPPA.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information 
  to we, he or she can contact us via e-mail or postal mail as listed below. We 
  will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child 
  under the age of 13. Please note that it is possible some of this information 
  may remain archived in web logs and back-up archives after we delete the information 
  from its active database (see above regarding web logs, and below regarding 
  archived information).</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">We believe that parents should supervise their children's online activities 
  and consider using parental control tools available from online services and 
  software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. 
  These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their 
  name, address and other personal information without parental permission.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">Other<br>
  We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration 
  of the information under our control. These include a firewall to prevent unauthorized 
  access to our systems and maintenance of registration information in a separate 
  database. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission 
  of information between your computer and our servers, we cannot ensure or warrant 
  the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet and we accept 
  no liability for any unintentional disclosure. We will protect the transmission 
  of credit card information through industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) 
  encryption.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">We may offer chat, user reviews, multi-player games, bulletin board, or other 
  public functions and any posting by you is considered public information available 
  to other users. Any posting is governed by our Terms of Use. You should take 
  care to not use personal information in your screen name or other information 
  that might be publicly available to other users.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">If a user elects to use our site for informing a friend about our site or particular 
  features or content, we ask them for the friend's name and e-mail address. 
  We will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit 
  our site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time 
  e-mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">Your personal information is password-protected, and you should take appropriate 
  measures to protect the secrecy of your password. If you use a computer in a 
  public place or share a computer with others, remember to sign out and close 
  your browser window when you finish a session with us in order to prevent others 
  from accessing your personal information.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">We maintain archives of our web logs, database, and other systems and information. 
  Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain archived 
  after we delete the information from its active database (see above regarding 
  web logs). We maintain archives for disaster recovery, legal and other non-marketing 
  purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="black_regular1">Profile<br>
  You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of your profile by notifying 
  us when you change your address, title, phone number, or e-mail address. If 
  at any time you wish to update your information or stop receiving communication 
  from us, sign in and then select 'update your profile' to change 
  your preferences.</span></p>
