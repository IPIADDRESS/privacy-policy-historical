<h2>Pacific University Web Privacy Policy</h2>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
  Pacific University is dedicated to ensuring the privacy and
      accuracy of your confidential information. We do not actively share any
    personal information
    gathered from our web servers with any third parties, however in some cases
    we may be compelled by law to release information gathered
      from our web servers such as e-mails sent to the web site, and information
  collected from web-based forms.</p>
<p>
  Pacific University also complies with the Family Educational
    Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which prohibits the release of education
      records without student permission. Although FERPA regulations
    apply only to Pacific students, Pacific University is equally commited
    to protecting the privacy of all visitors to our web site. </p>
<p>Pacific University's  web site consists of hundreds of web servers.
  Some sites hosted by Pacific may adopt different
  privacy statements as their specific needs require. If another Pacific web
  site has a privacy statement that is different from this statement, that
  policy must be approved by University Relations and University Information
  Services, and it must be posted on their site. However, those sites cannot
  adopt a privacy
  statement
  that in any way supersedes federal or state regulations.</p>
<h4>External Web Sites</h4>
<p>Pacific University's web site contains links to hundreds of external web
  sites. The University is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content
  of the external web sites we link to.</p>
<h4>Information We Gather</h4>
<p>
  Our web servers generate temporary logs that contain the following information:</p>

<ul>
 <li>IP Address (Internet Address of the computer being used)</li>
 <li>web pages requested</li>
    <li>Referring web page </li>
    <li>Browser/Operating System used </li> 
    <li>Date and Time</li> 
</ul>
  <p>The data is used in aggregate by system administrators and web content managers
    to tune the web site for its efficiency and is not associated
      with specific individuals. Data from the web server logs are only shared
      with
    the content manager of each web site. Summary reports produced from the logs
    help web publishers determine what web browsers and pages are most popular.
    For example, if the aggregate reports show a particular web page is very
      popular or used more by freshmen than by seniors, we use this information
      to customize
    the content of that page and make it easier to find. </p>
  <h4>Cookies</h4>
  <p>
    Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the web browser. Cookies are often
    used to remember information about preferences and pages you have visited.
    For example, when you visit some sites on the web you might see a "Welcome
    Back" message. The first time you visited the site a
    cookie was probably set on your computer; when you return, the cookie is
    read again.
    You can
    refuse to accept cookies, can disable cookies, and remove cookies from your
    hard drive. In Netscape Navigator, choose Edit and Preferences to manage
    your cookie settings; in Internet Explorer select Tools and Internet Options.    </p>
  <p>The Pacific University site use cookies to track web traffic patterns anonomously
    and for authentication purposes to online portals such as Boxer Online and
    Alumni web . These
    cookies are used so you will not have to repeatedly enter user names
    and
    passwords
    when
    you
    go
    to
  different parts of the web site. Some websites within Pacific University may
    also use cookies to retain user preference information. It is against University
    policy to share this
  information with external third parties.</p>
  <h4>Security and Accuracy of Confidential Information </h4>
  <p>
    Pacific University does its best to ensure that the personal information
      we have about you is accurate. Users with a PUNETID can check and update
        personal
      information, such as their addresses and e-mail addresses at <a href="http://myaccount.pacificu.edu">myaccount.pacificu.edu</a>.</p>
  <p>Although no computer system is 100 percent secure, the Pacific 
  has deployed extensive security measures to protect against the loss, misuse,
  or alteration of the information under our control. </p>
  <h4>E-Commerce </h4>
  <p>
    Several sites within Pacific's domain may enable you to pay
        for products or services online with a credit card. Unless otherwise
        noted, these
      transactions are encrypted. It is University policy that the confidential
      information you enter in the transaction is used only for the purposes
      described in
        that transaction, unless an additional use is specifically stated on
        that site.</p>
  <h4>Sharing of Information </h4>
  <p>Consistent with FERPA, we do not release personal student information, other
  than public directory information, to other parties unless we receive explicit
  written authorization to do so. Examples of directory
  information include first and last name, e-mail address, and department, UC
    Box,and your current status (ie student). Enrolled students can restrict
    release of their directory information by logging in and changing their
    preferences at <a href="http://myaccount.pacificu.edu ">myaccount.pacificu.edu </a>.</p>
  <h4>Public Forums </h4>
  <p>
    Pacific University may make chat rooms, forums, message boards,
      and news groups available to its users. The University does not ordinarily
      log public chat sessions, however, any information that is disclosed in
        these areas becomes public information and you should therefore exercise
        caution
      when deciding to disclose your confidential information in such places.</p>
  <p>Academic chat sessions and discussion forums may be logged. However, these
  educational records are protected from disclosure by FERPA.</p>
<h4>Online Surveys </h4>
<p>
   At any time there are
      numerous online surveys being conducted on Pacific's web site. It
      is University
      policy that confidential information gathered in these online surveys is
      used only for the research purposes indicated in the survey. Unless otherwise
      noted on the specified survey, your answers are confidential and individual
      responses will not be shared with other parties unless required by law.
     Aggregate data from surveys may be shared with external
      third parties. </p>
<h4>Questions</h4>
<p>
  If you have questions about this privacy statement or you believe that your
      personal information has been released without your consent send e-mail
      to <a href="mailto:webmaster@pacificu.edu.">webmaster@pacificu.edu.</a><br>
