         The PACER Service Center values your privacy.  If you visit
         our site to read or download information, we collect and store
         only the following information: 
         <ul>
            <img src="/images/blueball2.gif" align="bottom" hspace="5" alt="*">
             The name of the domain from which you access the Internet. 
            <br>

            <img src="/images/blueball2.gif" align="bottom" hspace="5" alt="*">
             The date and time you access our site. 
         </ul>

         PACER staff will not give, sell or transfer any personal
         information to third parties, except in the following cases: 
         <ul>
            <img src="/images/blueball2.gif" align="bottom" hspace="5" alt="*">
            To secure payment of delinquent fees, identifying
            information may be transmitted to a collection agency. 
            <br>

            <img src="/images/blueball2.gif" align="bottom" hspace="5" alt="*">
            If compelled by law. 
            <br>

            <img src="/images/blueball2.gif" align="bottom" hspace="5" alt="*">
            If you direct us to do so. 
            <br>

            <img src="/images/blueball2.gif" align="bottom" hspace="5" alt="*">
            In other legally limited circumstances
            (for example, to protect your account from fraud).
         </ul>

         For billing purposes, when you access court documents, we
         keep track of basic information about each transaction, such
         as the account, court, document type, search criteria,
         case number, time, date and number of pages. We also use
         session cookies to identify users. We will not provide this
         information to anyone, except for the situations set out above. 
         <br><br>

         You also may decide to send us personal identifying
         information--your mailing address, for example--in a request
         for information. Information collected in this manner is used
         solely for responding to requests for information. You should
         <b>NEVER</b> send your PACER password to us in an electronic mail
         message. 
         <br><br>

         When making payment by check, your check will be converted from
         a paper transaction to an electronic funds transfer in most cases.
         The conversion will be made by our authorized financial
         institution, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Treasury,
         Financial Management Service (FMS).   Check conversion information
         will be maintained by FMS in its Master Verification Database,
         which  contains information on negative check information or
         failed Automated Clearing House (ACH) debit entry transactions
         for certain checks that have been presented electronically to
         Federal agencies.  Federal agencies will have access to check
         verification databases to determine the validity and/or check
         writing history of the payor. FMS will not disclose information
         from the Master Verification for purposes of check verification. 
         Information may be used for law enforcement purposes and for
         other routine uses, such as systems development
         (See 68 Fed Reg. 5691 (2003) for a complete list of possible
         uses).  Making payment by check is voluntary but a decision not
         to do so will require you to make payment by some other method.
         <br><br>

         For site management, information is collected for statistical
         purposes, such as assessing the number of visitors to the
         different sections of our site, identifying what information
         is of most and least interest, determining technical design
         specifications, and identifying system performance or problem
         areas.  This information will be kept confidential.
         <br><br>

         Any attempt to collect data from PACER in a manner which avoids 
         billing is strictly prohibited and may result in criminal 
         prosecution or civil action.  PACER privileges will be terminated 
         if, in the judgment of judiciary personnel, they are being misused.  
         Misuse includes, but is not limited to, using an automated process 
         to repeatedly access those portions of the PACER application that 
         do not assess a fee  (i.e. calendar events report or case header 
         information) for purposes of collecting case information).   
         PACER account usage will be monitored for inappropriate use.
         <br><br><br>


         <div class="psc_blue_h2">Security</div>
         To identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change
         information, or otherwise cause damage, this Official
         United States Government System employs software programs
         to monitor network traffic. Unauthorized attempts to upload
         or change information stored on this system may result in
         criminal prosecution. 
         <br><br>

         To avoid unauthorized use of the PACER system, the PACER
         Service Center recommends that you do not leave your terminal
         unattended after logging into the PACER system. If you must
         leave your terminal unattended, close your open browsers.
         The PACER Service Center also recommends not bookmarking
         pages past the login screen of all Web PACER applications,
         and using a password protected screen saver.
