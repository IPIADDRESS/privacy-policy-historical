<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>
Effective March 26, 2007
</p>

<p>PatientsLikeMe realizes that our website, <a href="http://www.patientslikeme.com">www.patientslikeme.com</a> (the “Site”), can only work if we build trust with our patient communities. For that reason, members’ confidence in the security of the data they share with us is a top priority for us.</p>

<p>This policy outlines the type of information PatientsLikeMe collects from our members and how it is shared with other parties. We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time, and without prior notice, by posting amended terms on this website. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates or changes.</p>

<p>PatientsLikeMe allows patient members to track their important disease history information and share it with the rest of the patient community so that everyone can learn. Typical disease history information may include:</p>

<ul>
 <li>treatment regimens, including treatment start dates, stop dates, and dosages</li>

 <li>symptoms experienced, including severity and duration</li>

 <li>primary and secondary outcome scores (e.g. ALSFRS-R, MSFRS, PDFRS, or weight) over time</li>

 <li>disease history information like diagnosis date or family history</li>
</ul>

<p>PatientsLikeMe values the privacy of your data. We will never rent, sell or share information that personally identifies you for marketing purposes. In the future we may provide a permission-based service to allow our partners (including but not limited to pharmaceutical companies, medical devices companies, non-profits, and research institutions) to directly and anonymously communicate with you through our system. Further, we may provide our partners with anonymized data (which may or may not be aggregated) for research and commercial purposes.</p>

<p>During your registration as a member we ask you to provide certain information about yourself, including your name, address, email, birth date, and gender. In addition, members may also voluntarily enter personally identifiable information on the Site about themselves, including pictures, biographies, and information about illnesses they may have and treatments they may have tried. You may enter as much or as little of such information as you like.</p>

<p>Depending on the individual privacy level you select using the functionality of the Site, the information you provide may be visible to other members in the area of the Site reserved for members (the “Member Area”). You have several privacy levels you may choose for your profile, from partially hidden to completely visible to members. You may change your visibility level at any time on the Site using the functionality provided by the Site. (Read more about how to <a href="/help/my_space#manageprivacy">how to manage your privacy settings</a>.) Be assured that regardless of your profile’s visibility level, we never display your full name or street address, except in incidents when you have given explicit permission (for example, in the ALS Registry). Because the value of PatientsLikeMe is in helping other patients learn from your experience, we hope that you feel comfortable enough to make your profile as visible as possible.</p>

<p>You should expect that regardless of your profile’s visibility level, the information you enter may be available to the community in a completely anonymous form. For example, we may report the number of patients trying a particular treatment or the number of patients experiencing a particular symptom. We share the cumulative experience of the patient community, as well as anonymized data (which may or may not be aggregated), to help patients, doctors, and caregivers manage and treat their disease. Our success in achieving those goals will only happen if our community uses the site in this spirit of openness. However, we always respect your privacy and you are free not to enter any data that you are uncomfortable having shared in this fashion.</p>

<p>PatientsLikeMe cannot guarantee the identity of any other members with whom you may interact in the course of using the Site or who may have access (based on the privacy level you have selected) to information you have posted in the Member Area. Additionally, we cannot guarantee the authenticity of any data that members may provide about themselves.</p>

<p>We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our affiliates, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf.</p>

<p>Finally, you should know that PatientsLikeMe takes commercially reasonable technical precautions to help keep your data secure.</p>

<p>If you have questions or comments about our privacy policy, please <a href="mailto:%73%75%70%70%6f%72%74@%70%61%74%69%65%6e%74%73%6c%69%6b%65%6d%65.%63%6f%6d?subject=%5BPLM%5D%20Privacy">let us know</a>, or contact us at:</p>

<p><strong>History of Updates/Changes to Terms and Conditions of Use:</strong></p>

<ul>
 <li>On March 26, 2007, this Privacy Policy was substantially revised.</li>

 <li>On April 10, 2006, the following clauses were added: “We will provide our partners with anonymized, aggregated community data with the goal of increasing involvement in disease research” and “except in incidents when you have given explicit permission, e.g. in the ALS Registry.”</li>
