            <class="bodytext">Patriot Software, Inc., is at all times interested in providing you with the best 
            possible user experience. This includes a strong commitment to the privacy of our Clients and our 
            Clients' employees. To that end, we endeavor to provide you with a safe, secure service and use 
            commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private and 
            is used only for the expressed purpose of providing software and services to you and your employees. 
            The following statements provide additional details about our privacy commitment.<p> 

			<b>General Information and Disclosure of Information Received from Internet Users</b> (non-clients).<br>
			We gather information about our Internet visitors collectively, tracking such things as pages visited, 
			number of searches performed, keywords used in searches, etc. We only use this information anonymously 
			and in the aggregate. This information allows us to create a better overall experience for you by gauging 
			the level of traffic, speed, and overall performance of our Web site. We may share this information, in 
			the aggregate, with our vendors and advertisers to help them better understand our Web site and the services 
			we offer. When we do this, no information is released that would specifically identify you.</p><p> 

			<b>User Specific Information for Patriot Software, Inc. Clients And Their Employees</b><br>
			Patriot Software only requires the Client to provide information that our software needs to perform the tasks 
			it was designed to complete and so that we may provide the services we are obliged to perform pursuant to our 
			Client Services Agreement with the Client.  We will require specific information of the Client, which may include 
			the Company’s legal and D.B.A. names, contact information, Federal Employer Identification Number, and banking 
			information so that we may collect our fees.  We may also require the Client to provide information about its 
			employees, including name, Social Security number, federal and state tax withholding information, and banking 
			information for direct deposit of paychecks.</p><p>

			<b>Who does Patriot Software share my information with?</b><br> 
			Patriot Software will not share a Client's or its employees' information with any third parties who do not have a 
			legitimate business need to know and/or have not been authorized to receive the information. No information about 
			Clients or their employees will be "cross-shared" with any other Patriot Software Clients.</p><p>

			<b>How does Patriot Software keep my information private?</b><br>
			Patriot Software’s software resides on a secure server that encrypts the Client’s and its employees’ information 
			using Secure Socket Layers. The Client can verify that our server is secure by looking for the "s" after "http" in 
			the address line in the browser (example: https://www.PatriotSoftware.com).  You may also notice a padlock icon 
			somewhere in your browser.  Different browsers display this in different ways.  Patriot Software Clients can only 
			access their own company information and information pertaining to their own employees. We safeguard all data 
			submitted with both physical and electronic security measures.</p><p>

			<b>Children</b><br>
			Patriot Software, Inc., does not collect information specific to children and does not target children as users. We 
			believe that all children should have the consent of a parent or guardian prior to accessing Patriot Software's Web 
			Site. Inasmuch as we cannot control a child’s access to our site, we encourage parents to utilize Web filtering 
			technology to help you supervise your child’s use of this Web site and the Internet in general.</p><p>

			<b>Cookies</b><br>
			In order to optimize your experience, we utilize a common feature of your browser known as a "cookie." Cookies are 
			files stored on your computer’s hard drive that maintain information about your name, passwords, preferences, etc. 
			The use of cookies allows us to provide you with a faster, better experience on this Web site. If you are 
			uncomfortable with accepting this information from us, you may set your browser to reject cookies. Rejecting cookies, 
			however, may have a negative impact on your experience at our site.</p><p>

			<b>You are Responsible</b><br>
			Ultimately, you are responsible for protecting your own privacy online. We endeavor to provide you with the tools 
			necessary to successfully use our service and to protect your privacy. You are solely responsible for maintaining 
			the secrecy of your passwords and your user account information. Please exercise care and caution whenever you are 
			online.</p><p>

			other legal rights in or on behalf of any party. You use this Web site at your own risk.
