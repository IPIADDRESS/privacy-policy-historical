        Privacy Statement
    </h1>
    <div id="termsOfService">
        <p>
            The privacy of your personal health information is paramount. This privacy policy
            describes how ZirMed Inc. (variously, “ZirMed”, we, our or us) protects and handle the personal information that you or your physician
            provides and that we obtain through our web-based service at
            <a href="https://www.patientnotebook.com" target="_blank">https://www.patientnotebook.com</a> and related web sites (“Patient Notebook”).
        </p>
        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Patient Notebook is bringing together the latest technology and medical information
            to make managing your healthcare expenses and information much easier. With Patient
            Notebook, you can: (1) store and manage all types of healthcare communications in one
            central place; (2) pay your medical bills quickly, easily and securely; (3) and access other
            online health tools.<br>
            <br>
            Each person's information is stored and accessed separately in his or her own Patient
            Notebook account.
        </p>
        <h3>
            2. Creating an Account and Records: Collection of Your Personal Information
        </h3>
        <p>
            You choose whether or not to create an account with Patient Notebook. Accounts are only created
            in-person at your physician’s office. If you do not choose to create an account, you will only
            be allowed to send your physician: (a) an address update, (b) update your insurance information,
            (c) request that your physician’s office call you.
            <br>
            <br>
            The first time you sign in to Patient Notebook, you will be asked to update your password. To do
            so, you must provide personal information, such as your email address, name, and date of birth.
            <br>
            <br>
            Your email address will be your username and you will be asked to create a password.
            We will use the email address you provide to send you an email requesting that you
            validate your account.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can review and update your account information. You can also modify, add, or delete any
            optional information by signing into your Patient Notebook account and editing your
            account profile.<br>
            <br>
            An account allows you to manage your health and wellness bills and utilize the tools
            offered on Patient Notebook. Once you have an account, you can view, store, and
            pay health bills for yourself and dependents (to the extent you have right).<br>
            <br>
            When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those communications
            in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our services.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Account and Record Access and Controls</h3>
        <p>
            You are the custodian of any records you create or your physician sends
            to your account.

            is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on us; (b) protect
            and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements);
            or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety and welfare of

            also provide this information to our partners for such purposes. De-identified information
            does not include personally identifiable information such as name, email address,
            or address, but may include gender, height, weight, postal code, and medical information.
            Aggregated information is information from multiple users that is not associated
            with any individual user account.

        <p>
            Throughout Patient Notebook, you might be provided with information about other

            examine these providers’ individual privacy policies and terms of service prior
            to using their services because this privacy policy does not apply to the activities
            of such providers. We encourage you to contact us if you believe a provider is not
            protecting the privacy or security of your health and wellness information.

        </h3>
        <p>
            We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use
            a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal

            are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including
            termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

            10. Use of Cookies
        </h3>
        <p>
            We use cookies to enable you to sign in and to help personalize Patient Notebook.
            A cookie is a small text file that a web page server places on your hard disk. It
            is not possible to use cookies to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
            A web server assigns cookies uniquely to you, and only a web server in the domain
            that issued the cookie to you can read the cookies.<br>
            <br>
            One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save
            you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site,
            a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
            Using cookies simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site
            navigation. When you return to the web site, you can retrieve the information you
            previously provided, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized.<br>
            <br>
            You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
            accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline some
            or all cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline all cookies, you may not
            be able to use interactive features of this or other web sites that depend on cookies.

            on the home page of Patient Notebook or by sending you a notification directly.
            We encourage you to review this privacy statement periodically to stay informed
            about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued
            use of Patient Notebook constitutes your agreement to this privacy statement and
