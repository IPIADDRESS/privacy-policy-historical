   <h1>Waggle Labs Privacy Policy</h1>
   <h2>Last updated March 25 2008</h2>
   <p>Waggle Labs (including the Pathable, RealityAllStarz, and Swaggle Waggle Labs Services) takes your privacy seriously. </p>
   <p>Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.
  
     NOTICE: Click <a href="http://onguardonline.gov/index.html">here</a> for practical tips from the federal government and the technology industry to help you guard against Internet fraud, secure your computer and protect your personal information. </p>
   <p></p><h3>What This Privacy Policy Covers  </h3><p></p>
   <ul>
     <li>This policy covers how Waggle Labs treats personal information that Waggle Labs collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Waggle Labs products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.    </li>
     <li>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Waggle Labs does not own or control, or to people that Waggle Labs does not employ or manage.    </li>
     <li>Our website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. </li>
   </ul><p></p>
   <p></p><h3>Information we collect about you  </h3><p></p>
   <ul>
     <li><h3>In general.</h3> We may collect personal information that can identify you such as your name and e-mail address and other information that does not identify you. When you provide personal information through our website, the information may be sent to servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.</li>
     <li><h3>Information you provide</h3>. We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our website or provide to us in some other manner. This includes identifying information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, your location (such as zip code and/or country), and other demographic information and we may ask you to complete a survey or send us a review.</li>
     <li><h3>Information from other sources.</h3> We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from other IAC businesses, business partners, contractors, and other third parties and add it to our account information or other information we have collected. Examples of information that we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and additional demographic information.</li>
     <li><h3>Usage information.</h3>  Waggle Labs Services automatically receives and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, Waggle Labs cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request.</li>
     <li><h3>Purpose.</h3>  Waggle Labs uses information for the following general purposes: to fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, customize the advertising and content you see, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.    </li>
     <li><h3>Information about others. </h3>We may also collect and store personal information about other people that you provide to us. If you use our website to send others (friends, relatives, colleagues, etc.) a gift, information that may interest them, invitations or messages through our system, we may store your personal information, and the personal information of each such recipient. We use group and event inviteesâ€™ contact information to allow them to respond to and comment on your  invitation.  At your request, we may send reminders to group members and guests and display their profile information to others in the same group or event. We also may send a post-event email to the host, guests, group moderator, and group members. If you use our communication services, we use the information you provide in your communication to send it to you and others to whom you have requested it be sent. Other than as described in this Policy we will not intentionally sell or otherwise disclose guest contact information you submit to any third party. We may also collect guests' contact information in order to provide certain services through our Site. If you submit contact information as a user or a guest, such as email address and/or phone number, to a Waggle Labs Service in order to use the service such contact information will NOT be shared with other group members or guests without your explicit permission. 
    
       You may delete your name from any group or event guest list by requesting to be removed from the group or guest list on the invitation page. Once your name and contact information is removed from the group or guest list, it will no longer be accessible to other group members, moderators, event hosts, or guests. </li>
   </ul><p></p>
   <p></p><h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3><p></p>
   <p> Waggle Labs does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Waggle Labs under confidentiality agreements.  However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.</li>
     <li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</li>
     <li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Waggle Labs's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
     <li>We transfer information about you if Waggle Labs is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Waggle Labs will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
     <li> Waggle Labs displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteriaâ€”for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. Waggle Labs does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.</li>
     <li>Waggle Labs advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).    </li>
   </ul><p></p>
   <p></p><h3>Aggregated and non-personal information.</h3><p></p>
   <p>We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and our IAC sister companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.</p>
   <p></p><h3>Cookies</h3><p></p>
   <ul>
     <li>Waggle Labs may set and access Waggle Las cookies on your computer.</li>
     <li>Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Waggle Labs's cookies.    </li>
   </ul><p></p>
   <p></p><h3>Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences    </h3><p></p>
   <ul>
     <li>You can edit your Waggle Labs Account Information at any time.</li>
     <li>You can delete your Waggle Labs account by visiting your account settings page, or by emailing us at support@wagglelabs.com. If you delete your account, any residual information we retain after you delete your account will either be anonymized or exist only in aggregate with other user information.</li>
     <li>You can stop the delivery of future personal or promotional e-mail from Waggle Labs Services by following the specific instructions in the e-mail you receive or by editing your account information.</li>
   </ul><p></p>
   <p></p><h3>Confidentiality and Security</h3><p></p>
   <ul>
     <li>We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</li>
     <li>We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.    </li>
   </ul><p></p>
   <p></p><h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3><p></p>
   <ul><li>Waggle Labs may update this policy. </li>
     <li>We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Waggle Labs account(s) or by placing a prominent notice on our site. </li>
