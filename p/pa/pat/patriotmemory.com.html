									  	   <p><em>At CeBIT Patriot pushes the envelope of Full ATX Workstation performance</em><br>
<br>
Fremont, California, USA, March 3, 2010 - Patriot Memory, a global pioneer in high-performance memory, NAND flash and computer technology, today announced a 10TB SSD based Full ATX Workstation, code named Project Artemis, on display at CeBIT in Hannover, Germany.<br>
<br>
Project Artemis is a blazing fast computer built using 40 256GB Patriot Torqx SSD drives offering a combined 10TB of storage and incredible speed. As an internal effort to test the performance delivered by the award winning Patriot Torqx SSD drives, Project Artemis became an exciting project for Patriot engineers to push the performance envelope of a computer running off of Solid State Drives. To assemble this system, Patriot used 10 5.25" bay adaptors that each hold four 2.5" SATA drives and when combined with five LSI™ Mega-RAID®: SAS 9260-8i eight-port 6GB/s SATA+SAS RAID controllers, the 40 Torqx drives in RAID 0 configuration achieve breathtaking performance:  over 150,000 IOPS and over 5,500 Write speed. These breathtaking results destroy performance numbers seen in recent testing of SSD RAID configurations.<br>
<br> 
"Started as an internal project from the Engineering department, this blossomed into the fastest  SSD system we have seen," says Patriot CEO Paul Jones. "Too cool to leave hidden inside the Patriot engineering labs, we decided to use Project Artemis as a demonstration of real world enterprise level performance from SSD based systems. The incredible results we have achieved are a testament to Patriots dedication to develop and deliver the highest performance products available. Expect new product announcements based on our efforts with Project Artemis."<br>
<br>
"Patriot is well known for delivering high-performance memory and solid-state drive solutions to the PC enthusiast market," said Brent Blanchard, director of worldwide channel sales and marketing, LSI Corporation. "LSI MegaRAID SATA+SAS controllers based on 6Gb/s SAS technology provide the support for SSDs and superior levels of performance, reliability and scalability required to meet the demands of compute-intensive applications. LSI MegaRAID controllers are a natural fit for Patriot?s high-performance, SSD based system."

									  	   <p>Patriot Memory, a global pioneer in high-performance memory, NAND flash and computer technology, announced the celebration of their 25th year Anniversary.<br> 
<br>
The year was 1985 when three longtime friends established a small computer company in Davis, CA. The business moved to the Silicon Valley soon after, and over the years established itself as one of the premier DRAM, flash memory, and storage solutions providers in the industry, known as Patriot Memory. Fostering a corporate atmosphere where teamwork, integrity, and fun are inherent along with an open door policy where ideas from employees, customers and vendors are heard and developed, Patriot Memory has earned a solid reputation for providing innovative products and top-notch customer service. As CEO Paul Jones states, "One of the cornerstones of Patriot's foundation is the emphasis we put on nurturing lasting partnerships with our customers and vendors alike."<br>
<br>
Focused on delivering world-class solutions to an increasingly technologically advanced customer base, Patriot has been an innovator in product development, and has established itself as an icon in the industry. CFO and co founder Douglas Diggs credits Patriot's success to the network of strong partnerships with its customers and vendors. Moreover, he notes, "Our employee base has been tremendous. Without the constant hard work, dedication and innovation of our employees, our business would be significantly different today. We are able to maintain that consistent message of dedication, knowledge and expertise.  Employee retention has kept our knowledge and expertise in house.

									  	   <p>Fremont, California, USA, February 3, 2010 - Patriot Memory, a global pioneer in high-performance memory, NAND flash and computer technology, today announced the launch of its new Sector 5 Series Extreme Performance DDR3 memory.<br>
<br>
Designed specifically for overclockers and enthusiasts using Intel based platforms, the Sector 5 boasts an amazing 2250MHz with timings of 9-9-9-27. Individually hand tested on the Intel P55 chipset platform; the Sector 5 modules offer incredible performance for users looking to reach new heights in overclocking and benchmarking.

									  	   <p><em>Patriot Launches their Two Bay Network Attached Storage</em><br>
<br>
Patriot Memory, a global pioneer in high-performance memory, NAND flash and computer technology, today announced the release of their new Valkyrie two-bay network attached storage device targeted for SOHO and 'prosumer' users.<br>
<br>
In today's multi-media world, the need to have large storage capacity has quickly changed from being a luxury to being a necessity. Network Attached Storage (NAS) is designed to meet this need, and has become the local storage solution for home networks and small businesses.  NAS has become the central digital media and file 'hub' for your entire network. Rather than supporting just one computer, now you can support multiple digital devices within the home as well as share files across the internet.<br>
<br>
The Patriot Valkyrie Dual Bay NAS is the perfect solution to consolidate your digital content into one device accessible to users across the network.  Valkyrie offers large storage capacity (up to 4TB total storage using 2 x SATA HDD), a compact design and a flexible and powerful interface for managing multiple users and access rights making this an ideal storage solution. Valkyrie's Web access feature allows remote users to instantly and securely access all digital files stored on the Valkyrie, making file exchange or retrieval possible via an internet connection anywhere in the world. Multimedia streaming is possible with built-in UPnP™ and DNLA® support and iTunes® music server while also offering PC-less downloading via BitTorrent™. Equipped with a multitude of features normally found on larger, more expensive NAS devices and an easy to use interface, Valkyrie brings the versatility of a robust network storage device to everyone.<br>
<br>
"The addition of Valkyrie to our NAS solutions, with its enhanced functionality and ease of use gives consumers a powerful solution at an affordable price," says Jack Chen, Patriot's Peripheral Product Manager. "Our goal is to bring products to the market that provide versatility, scalability and functionality at a price that consumers feel offer comparable product features to the high end devices, yet are affordable to the everyday user."<br>
