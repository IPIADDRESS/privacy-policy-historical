									  	   <p><em>At CeBIT Patriot pushes the envelope of Full ATX Workstation performance</em><br>
<br>
Fremont, California, USA, March 3, 2010 - Patriot Memory, a global pioneer in high-performance memory, NAND flash and computer technology, today announced a 10TB SSD based Full ATX Workstation, code named Project Artemis, on display at CeBIT in Hannover, Germany.<br>
<br>
Project Artemis is a blazing fast computer built using 40 256GB Patriot Torqx SSD drives offering a combined 10TB of storage and incredible speed. As an internal effort to test the performance delivered by the award winning Patriot Torqx SSD drives, Project Artemis became an exciting project for Patriot engineers to push the performance envelope of a computer running off of Solid State Drives. To assemble this system, Patriot used 10 5.25" bay adaptors that each hold four 2.5" SATA drives and when combined with five LSI™ Mega-RAID®: SAS 9260-8i eight-port 6GB/s SATA+SAS RAID controllers, the 40 Torqx drives in RAID 0 configuration achieve breathtaking performance:  over 150,000 IOPS and over 5,500 Write speed. These breathtaking results destroy performance numbers seen in recent testing of SSD RAID configurations.<br>
<br> 
"Started as an internal project from the Engineering department, this blossomed into the fastest  SSD system we have seen," says Patriot CEO Paul Jones. "Too cool to leave hidden inside the Patriot engineering labs, we decided to use Project Artemis as a demonstration of real world enterprise level performance from SSD based systems. The incredible results we have achieved are a testament to Patriots dedication to develop and deliver the highest performance products available. Expect new product announcements based on our efforts with Project Artemis."<br>
<br>
"Patriot is well known for delivering high-performance memory and solid-state drive solutions to the PC enthusiast market," said Brent Blanchard, director of worldwide channel sales and marketing, LSI Corporation. "LSI MegaRAID SATA+SAS controllers based on 6Gb/s SAS technology provide the support for SSDs and superior levels of performance, reliability and scalability required to meet the demands of compute-intensive applications. LSI MegaRAID controllers are a natural fit for Patriot?s high-performance, SSD based system."

									  	   <p>Patriot Memory, a global pioneer in high-performance memory, NAND flash and computer technology, announced the celebration of their 25th year Anniversary.<br> 
<br>
The year was 1985 when three longtime friends established a small computer company in Davis, CA. The business moved to the Silicon Valley soon after, and over the years established itself as one of the premier DRAM, flash memory, and storage solutions providers in the industry, known as Patriot Memory. Fostering a corporate atmosphere where teamwork, integrity, and fun are inherent along with an open door policy where ideas from employees, customers and vendors are heard and developed, Patriot Memory has earned a solid reputation for providing innovative products and top-notch customer service.

<br>
Focused on delivering world-class solutions to an increasingly technologically advanced customer base, Patriot has been an innovator in product development, and has established itself as an icon in the industry. CFO and co founder Douglas Diggs credits Patriot's success to the network of strong partnerships with its customers and vendors. Moreover, he notes, "Our employee base has been tremendous. Without the constant hard work, dedication and innovation of our employees, our business would be significantly different today. We are able to maintain that consistent message of dedication, knowledge and expertise.  Employee retention has kept our knowledge and expertise in house. Many of our employees have been here for ten, fifteen and even twenty years."<br>
<br>
Company CEO, Paul Jones adds, "It is a team effort to remain flexible, able to quickly adapt to new technology and market conditions while keeping Patriot at the forefront of the rapidly changing technology market. We work hard to stay ahead of the technology curve; proactively developing products to deliver the best possible user experience and solutions that are going to keep our customer base in tune with current advancements in technology and consumer electronics."<br>
<br>
Today, Patriot is one the oldest branded memory companies in the USA and continues to manufacture at their Fremont, California headquarters. They have offices across the globe and continue to expand their product solutions into storage and media related products.<br>

<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Patriot’s Fuel iON for the iPhone® 6 has been recognized for its innovative and excellent design quality</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong><img style="float: left;" src="http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2015/05/11/12716043/gI_85479_COMPUTEX%20d%20and%20i%20awards%202015%20logo.png" alt="" width="250" height="216">FREMONT, CALIF., USA – June 2, 2015</strong>– Patriot, a leading manufacturer of mobile accessories, computer memory, USB flash and SSDs, has won the 2015 COMPUTEX Design &amp; Innovation award (COMPUTEX d&amp;i award) in the Peripherals and Accessories category for its robust Fuel iON magnetic charging ecosystem for the iPhone 6.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The COMPUTEX d&amp;i awards were selected by a panel of six distinguished experts on April 9,2015 in Taipei, Taiwan. After careful examination and assessment of 271 entries, 72 were selected to receive this distinguished honor, including Patriot’s Fuel iON. Degree of innovation, functionality, quality of design and brand value was some of the criteria used to evaluate the entries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The awards will be presented on June 2, 2015 at the world’s second largest ICT trade show, COMPUTEX TAIPEI 2015. The award-winning product, including the FUEL iON, will be on display at COMPUTEX 2015 until June 6, 2015 and will also be part of the award winners’ exhibition at other ICT trade shows such as: IFA 2015 in Berlin, Germany, 2016 International CES in Las Vegas, USA, MWC 2016 in Barcelona, Spain and CeBit 2016 in Hanover, Germany.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Patriot is honored to receive this recognition for innovation in technology for its Fuel iON ecosystem for the iPhone 6.&nbsp; We feel the Fuel iON will change the way people charge and use their smartphones, offering convenient charging and protection in daily use,” said Taron Chang, Patriot’s General Manager of APAC Headquarters.&nbsp;“We are excited to showcase our products at Computex 2015 and continue to develop new and innovative accessories for technology enthusiasts.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Fuel iON ecosystem offers consumers a simple, viable and efficient solution to charge their smartphone and increase the longevity of the device by eliminating the need for a plug-in cord and reducing wear and tear on external ports. Patriot has developed a way to conductively charge a smartphone using neodymium magnets. The incredibly strong magnetic fields on both the Fuel iON phone cases and charging bases creates a direct connection between the two devices and snaps the phone into place; this allows for a charge that is comparable to plugging into a wall outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In addition to the iPhone 6, the Fuel iON currently supports the iPhone 5/5s, Samsung Galaxy S4/5 and Note 3. These can be paired with any of the three different charging bases: FUEL iON Charging Stand, FUEL iON Charging Pad or the FUEL iON Car Charger.&nbsp; Designed for versatility and convenience whether you are at home, work or on the road, all three provide solutions for charging anytime, anywhere in a functional way offering 360 degree rotational views.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For those who are constantly on-the-go Patriot also offers a 2100mAh magnetic portable battery that connects to the back of the case and provides an extra boost of power without the restrictions of connecting to a cord. In addition to the magnetic portable battery patriot offers a magnetic charging cord that can easily be packed in a bag and taken on vacation.</p>

									  	   <p><em>Patriot Launches their Two Bay Network Attached Storage</em><br>
<br>
Patriot Memory, a global pioneer in high-performance memory, NAND flash and computer technology, today announced the release of their new Valkyrie two-bay network attached storage device targeted for SOHO and 'prosumer' users.<br>
<br>
In today's multi-media world, the need to have large storage capacity has quickly changed from being a luxury to being a necessity. Network Attached Storage (NAS) is designed to meet this need, and has become the local storage solution for home networks and small businesses.  NAS has become the central digital media and file 'hub' for your entire network. Rather than supporting just one computer, now you can support multiple digital devices within the home as well as share files across the internet.<br>
<br>
The Patriot Valkyrie Dual Bay NAS is the perfect solution to consolidate your digital content into one device accessible to users across the network.  Valkyrie offers large storage capacity (up to 4TB total storage using 2 x SATA HDD), a compact design and a flexible and powerful interface for managing multiple users and access rights making this an ideal storage solution. Valkyrie's Web access feature allows remote users to instantly and securely access all digital files stored on the Valkyrie, making file exchange or retrieval possible via an internet connection anywhere in the world. Multimedia streaming is possible with built-in UPnP™ and DNLA® support and iTunes® music server while also offering PC-less downloading via BitTorrent™. Equipped with a multitude of features normally found on larger, more expensive NAS devices and an easy to use interface, Valkyrie brings the versatility of a robust network storage device to everyone.<br>
<br>
"The addition of Valkyrie to our NAS solutions, with its enhanced functionality and ease of use gives consumers a powerful solution at an affordable price," says Jack Chen, Patriot's Peripheral Product Manager. "Our goal is to bring products to the market that provide versatility, scalability and functionality at a price that consumers feel offer comparable product features to the high end devices, yet are affordable to the everyday user."<br>
