						<h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>

						<p>This privacy policy describes how the Pathao.com website and related application (the "Site", "we" or "us") collects, uses, shares and protects the personal information that we collect through this Site. Pathao has established this Site to link up users who need something shipped or delivered ("Customers") with individuals who will provide the shipping and delivery services ("Couriers") or teams of affiliated Couriers ("Teams"). This policy also applies to any mobile applications that we develop for use with our services and Team specific pages on the Site, and references to this "Site", "we" or "us" is intended to also include these mobile applications. Please read below to learn more about our information practices. By using this Site, you agree to these practices.</p>

						<h2>How we collect information</h2>

						<h3>Information provided by your web browser</h3>

						<p>You have to provide us with personal information like your name, contact no, mailing address and email id, our app will also fetch your location information in order to give you the best service. Like many other websites, we may record information that your web browser routinely shares, such as your browser type, browser language, software and hardware attributes, the date and time of your visit, the web page from which you came, your Internet Protocol address and the geographic location associated with that address, the pages on this Site that you visit and the time you spent on those pages. This will generally be anonymous data that we collect on an aggregate basis. We may also use Google Analytics or a similar service to gather statistical information about the visitors to this Site and how they use the Site. This, also, is done on an anonymous basis. We will not try to associate anonymous data with your personally identifiable data. If you would like to learn more about Google Analytics, please click here.</p>

						<h3>Personal information that you provide</h3>

						<p>If you want to use our service or contact a Pathao member, you must create an account on our Site. To establish your account, we will ask for personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you, which may include your name, phone number, and e-mail address. We may also collect demographic information about you, such as your zip code, and allow you to submit additional information that will be part of your Pathao profile.</p>

						<p>Other than basic information that we need to establish your account, it will be up to you to decide how much information to share as part of your profile. We encourage you to think carefully about the information that you share and we recommend that you guard your identity and your sensitive information. Of course, you can review and revise your profile at any time.</p>

						<p>From time to time, we may run contests or promotions and ask for a postal mailing address and other personal information relating to the contest or promotion. It will always be your choice whether to provide your personal information in order to participate in these events.</p>

						<h3>Payment Information</h3>

						<p>Our only payment channel is cash on delivery. Thus, if you are a Customer, you will make payments once the courier is at your door step. We will have your adress and cotact no. in order to identify the customer.</p>

						<p>We may also provide you with the opportunity to refer a potential customer to our Pathao services and earn a commission on the referral.
