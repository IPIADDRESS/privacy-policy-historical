<p></p><br>

<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Personal Information.</span>					
<br>
The purpose of the Patent Buddy website is to permit Users to voluntarily provide information about themselves for the purposes of developing, maintaining and enhancing a network of professional contacts. You willingly provide us certain personal information, which we collect in order to allow you to benefit from the Patent Buddy website. If you have any hesitation about providing such information to us and/or having such information displayed on the Patent Buddy website or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, you should not become a member of the Patent Buddy community.
<br> <br>
We collect your personal information in the following ways:

</p><br>

<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Registration.</span>					
<br>
In order to become a User, you must first create an account on our website. To create an account you are required to provide the following contact information, which you recognize and expressly acknowledge is personal information allowing others, including Patent Buddy, to identify you: name, email address, name of the organization that you are associated with, and a password chosen by you.
<br>

</p><br>

<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Profile Information.</span>					
<br>
Once you become a User, you may provide additional information in the Profile section describing your skills, professional experiences, and awards/recognitions. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration to become a User is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find new opportunities in the Patent Buddy system to build and leverage your professional network. Any information you provide at registration or in the Profile section that is not personally identifiable may be used in the same manner and extent to which other information that is not personally identifiable is permitted to be used hereunder, including for the purpose of serving advertisements through the service. If you opt-out you may lose the potential benefit of being a User, including receiving ads that are more targeted to your interests.
<br>

</p><br>


<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Customer Service.</span>					
<br>
Patent Buddy may collect information through the Patent Buddy website or through the Customer Service in order to, among other things, accurately categorize and respond to a customer's inquiry and deliver appropriate service levels.
<br>

</p><br>

<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Cookies.</span>					
<br>
Like most websites, Patent Buddy uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows Patent Buddy to recognize you as a User when you return to the Patent Buddy website using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use the Patent Buddy website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on our website.
<br>
One type of cookie, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you've logged in to your Patent Buddy account. The next time you visit the Patent Buddy website, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to log in before using the service. In order to access or change any of your private information or to send a message to another User, however, you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie.
<br>
Additionally, if you log out of the Patent Buddy website you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Patent Buddy website. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.
<br>
We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing User preferences and tracking User trends. In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing services to our Users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any information provided to third parties through such cookies will not be personally identifiable but may provide general segment information, e.g. your industry or geographic location, your occupation, or information about your professional or educational background, for greater customization of your user experience. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies or you opt to refuse all cookies, you may not be able to use the Patent Buddy website or services effectively. Patent Buddy does not store personally identifiable information in the cookies.
<br>

</p><br>

<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Web Beacons.</span>					
<br>
We allow other Patent Owners, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. Patent Buddy may "target" some ads to Users that fit a certain general profile - for example, "product managers in Texas". Patent Buddy does NOT use personally identifiable information to target ads.
<br>
To deliver these ads properly, Patent Buddy may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by Patent Buddy so the networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites.
<br>
Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these Patent Owners can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.
<br>
These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. Patent Buddy does not provide personally identifiable information to any advertiser or any other third party.
<br>

</p><br>


<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Log files, IP addresses and information about your computer.</span>					
<br>
Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Patent Buddy web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave Patent Buddy. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Patent Buddy service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is not shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law.
<br>

</p><br>


<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Consent to Patent Buddy Processing Information About You.</span>					
<br>
Certain information you provide to Patent Buddy may reveal, or allow others to identify more  about you. Please be aware that in providing information to Patent Buddy for the purposes of opening your user account, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and Patent Buddy's User Agreement. The supplying of all such information by you to Patent Buddy, including all information deemed "sensitive" by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, but please note that your withdrawal of consent will not be retroactive.
<br>

</p><br>

<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Rights to Access, Correct and Eliminate Information About You.</span>					
<br>
You have a right to access, modify, correct and eliminate the data about you which has been collected pursuant to your decision to become a User. If you update any of your information, we may keep a copy of the information which you originally provided to us in our archives for uses documented herein.
<br>

<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Uses of personal information.</span>					
<br>
Patent Buddy is an online service dedicated to helping all types of professionals more effectively connect with one another. The personally identifiable information you choose to provide on our website is used to help you describe yourself to other Users. Other information, that does not personally identify you as an individual, is collected by Patent Buddy from Users (such as, for example, patterns of utilization) and is exclusively owned by Patent Buddy. This information can be utilized by Patent Buddy in such manner as Patent Buddy, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.
<br>

</p><br>

<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Patent Buddy Communications.</span>					
<br>
Patent Buddy will communicate with you through email and notices posted on the Patent Buddy website or through other means available through the service, including text and other forms of messaging. If we send any communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you understand you will pay any service fees associated with any such access. These include welcome email which help inform new Users about various features of the service. Please be aware that you will always receive certain emails from Patent Buddy related to the proper functioning of your account, such as email notices when another User in your network sends you an opportunity. Patent Buddy may send you promotional information. You can change your e-mail and contact preferences at any time by logging into your 'Preferences Page' and amending your email notification choices. If you wish, you can also opt-out of receiving promotional emails, by sending a request to

<br>

</p><br>

<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Customized Content.</span>					
<br>
Information provided to Patent Buddy (or to third parties with whom it offers combined services) is also used to customize your experience on our website.
<br>

</p><br>

<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Sharing Information with Third Parties.</span>					
<br>
Patent Buddy takes the privacy of Users very seriously. We will share your personally identifiable information with third parties to carry out your instructions or to provide specific services or information. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and they are bound by confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.
<br>
Patent Buddy offers a "public profile" feature which allows Users to publish portions of their Patent Buddy profile, including their "name", but not their "email address", however Patent Buddy does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their cache.
<br>
We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of our services to third parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on Patent Buddy. 
<br>

</p><br>

<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Testimonials and Advertisement Placed through Patent Buddy DirectAds Service.</span>					
<br>

If you provide any testimonials about  the Patent Buddy service or place advertisements through  Patent Buddy wetion of its service to third parties, which testimonials and advertisements may include your name and other personal information that you have provided. In connection with our promotion of our services to third parties we may disclose the name of organizations for which our users work. For example, we may publish a list of entities that have employees as registered users to demonstrate the breadth and types of entities that use our website. <br>

</p><br>

<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Communications to other Users.</span>					
<br>
Many emails you initiate through Patent Buddy, e.g., an invitation sent to a non-User, will list your email address and name in the header of the message. Other communications that you initiate through the Patent Buddy website, like a request for contact, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal contact information. Your contact information will only be shared with another User if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish contact with each other.
<br>

</p><br>

<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Legal Disclaimers.</span>					
<br>
It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law, such as responses to civil or criminal subpoenas, or other requests by law enforcement personnel. We will disclose such information wherein we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, subpoena, or other legal process or request to Patent Buddy brought in any country throughout the world, or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
<br>

</p><br>

<p style="line-height: 2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="font-bold">Disclosures to others.</span>					
<br>
