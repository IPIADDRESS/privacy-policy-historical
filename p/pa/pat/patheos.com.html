<p><strong>Information Collected and Used by our Site.</strong> Our Site will only collect Personal Information which you knowingly and voluntarily provide. We may use Personal Information to authenticate Members and to send notifications to our Members relating to the Service. Our Site also collects other Personal Information, including, but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, education and occupation in order to assist Members in finding and communicating with each other and in order to customize offers and target communications to our Members. The Personal Information you supply allows us and/or our third party service providers to respond to your requests and to provide a variety of services on or associated with the Site.</p>
<p>Our Site also logs information which, in itself, does not personally identify you, including IP address, aggregate user data (which will not contain any Personal Information as it relates to a single visitor), browser type, and similar technical information regarding your computer, network and browser.  This data is used to manage our Site, track usage and improve the Site. We may share this information with third-parties to provide more relevant services, tools, resources, Content and advertisements to Members, as well as for operational purposes. User and Member IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.</p>
<p>The profiles of our Members, including Members' pictures and screen names are displayed to other Members in order to facilitate Member interaction among Members on our Site.  Members' full names and email addresses are never directly revealed to other Members by us.  Members can also communicate with other Members through the Site without disclosing email addresses.</p>
<p>We may use Members' email addresses to send updates regarding the Site. Users may choose not to receive email of this type by clicking on the "SafeUnsubscribe" link in received emails and choosing the "Yes, unsubscribe me from ALL mailings." option on the unsubscribe page.</p>
<p>From time to time we or a third party may sponsor a survey, promotion, sweepstakes or contest on our Site.  You will generally need to be a Member to participate and you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information in order to do so. You will be notified at the time your Personal Information is requested and collected during your participation as to which entity is collecting the Personal Information. Information you provide to or for a third party, even if provided to us simultaneously (for example, in a joint promotion) is governed by their privacy policies and practices not ours and you should inquire about their policies and practices so you are aware of and agree to the manner in which they handle and treat any Personal Information you make available to them. We may also share your information with our business or promotional partners, with a subsequent entity that acquires or is merged with our business or with creditors and we may share Personal Information to certain advertising partners from which you have explicitly requested to receive information.  We reserve the right to transfer Personal Information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of our Site or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest.</p>
<p>In addition, we may from time to time, transfer or merge your Personal Information collected online to our offline databases. We may also combine Personal Information we collect online with information available from other sources, including information received from our advertisers and promotional partners. This Privacy Policy remains applicable to your Personal Information for as long as your Personal Information is in our possession, even if you terminate or discontinue your use of our Site and you acknowledge and agree you will be bound by its terms.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Cookies by our Site and by Third Party Advertisers.</strong> Our Site uses cookies to store visitors' preferences and record session information, for purposes including ensuring that visitors are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements and to customize Content based on browser type and user profile information. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on our Site. You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set -- each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences -- however, you must enable cookies from our Site in order to use most functions on our Site. <br>Advertisements appearing on our Site may be delivered to users and Members by a third party advertiser. Such third party advertisers may use cookies that allow the advertiser's server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, the third party advertiser's servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked on. This information allows a third party advertiser to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.  <strong>Please note that this Privacy Policy only covers the use of cookies by us on our Site and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers or third parties, even if an advertisement appears on our Site.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Links.</strong> Our Site may provide links to other Web sites or resources.  These links are for your convenience only and are not under our control.  You acknowledge and agree that Patheos is not responsible for such external Web sites or resources, and neither Patheos nor our Site endorses any such Web site, its use or contents and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such Web sites or resources.  You agree that neither Patheos nor our Site shall be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage, viruses or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with your use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on such external Web sites or resources.  In the event you decide to access or use any of these other Web sites or resources, you agree you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Safety Tips.</strong> Our Site makes it easy to express yourself, connect with friends and make new ones, but please remember that what you post could embarrass you or expose you to danger. Here are some common sense guidelines that you should follow when using our Site and the Public Areas on our Site:</p>
<p>•	Don't forget that your profile and the Site's forums are public spaces. Don't provide Member Content to others or post anything you wouldn't want the world to know (e.g., your phone number, address, IM screen name, or specific whereabouts). Avoid posting anything that would make it easy for a stranger (or anyone else you may not want) to find you. <br>•	If you feel someone's behavior is inappropriate, illegal or offensive, react.  Report it to our Site or the authorities. <br>•	Don't mislead people into thinking that you're older or younger or are someone you are not. <br>•	Don't get hooked by a phishing scam. Phishing is a method commonly used by criminals to obtain personal information, such as your username and password, by pretending to be a Web site or a company that you trust.</p>
