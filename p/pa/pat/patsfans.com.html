<p>
Thank you for visiting PatsFans.com.  We are fans just like you, and we value our privacy just as much as you do.  To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the way the information is used.
</p><p>
<b>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b>
</p><p>
At some areas of the site, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls, subscribe to services such as online newsletters, e-mail lists, etc, and participate in our messageboard communities.  The types of information that may be requested and collected at these pages are:
</p><p>

E-mail Address<br>
Address<br>

We also may collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) , your I.P. Address, and the address of the website you were referred from.  
</p><p>
We may also request that you participate occasionally in an anonymous survey, requesting just your sex, age, household income, and other information which is used to put together demographics for our advertisers.   The survey will not be able to personally identify you, and simply helps us work with advertisers to design a campaign that will fit the needs of those who visit this site.
</p><p>
There may be other occasions where you can submit information about other people.  For example, you might submit a friend's name and e-mail address to send a story, or invite them to our site.  We collect this information but only in the event we need to step in to prevent abuse or other misuse of that e-mail tool (e.g. someone e-mailing that story 300 times to one person). 
</p><p>
<b>HOW WE USE THE INFORMTATION</b>
</p><p>
We may use the information that you provide for account set up and to fulfill your request for products, programs, and services.  We will sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you of when you have won a contest, when changes to your account may be required, or to notify you in the event of any major changes in policy or services offered here at the site.
</p><p>
