                  <p>
                    Planck, LLC, d/b/a Patch Media ("Patch", "we" or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy discloses our practices regarding information we collect and receive from users of the Patch.com desktop and mobile websites (the “Sites”), the Patch mobile applications (the “Apps”) and other services, such as emails, provided by Patch (collectively, the “Service”). Unless we state otherwise, any new features or functionality provided by Patch on the Sites and/or Apps are also part of the Service. By accessing or using the Service, whether through a personal computer, mobile device or any other means, or submitting any content or information for publication or distribution, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before registering or using the Service or submitting any content. If you do not accept this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Service or submit any content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Just like your local community, Patch and the Service are growing and changing every day, and thus this Privacy Policy is subject to change by Patch at any time. The most current version of this Privacy Policy can always be viewed on the Sites, and we will always let you know when the latest update occurred – just check the “Effective Date” at the end of the Privacy Policy posted on the Sites. If you keep using the Service or submit any content after the latest Effective Date, we assume that you have accepted the new Privacy Policy.
                  </p>

                  <h3>How We Disclose Your Information</h3>
                  <p>Patch may disclose your information, including Personal Information, to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Our service providers or Partners who provide services to Patch, such as user support; marketing services; hosting; research and analytics; administration of contests and sweepstakes; sending or supporting advertising; and otherwise in connection with provision of the Service, and who have agreed to use your Personal Information only as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
                    <li>In order to process a payment, Patch may provide information, including your personal information, to a third party payment processor(s). Patch is not responsible for any third party payment processor’s privacy practices.</li>

                    <li>In connection with investigation, prevention or action Patch may take, in our discretion, with respect to activities we believe may be illegal, or violate our
                      <a href="http://corp.patch.com/terms/">Terms of Use</a> or other policies, or an emergency that may pose a threat to your or another person’s safety, or as necessary to protect Patch’s rights and property.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>We will not sell your Personal Information to any third party not affiliated with Patch without your consent, except in connection with the sale or merger of Patch or its assets or the division responsible for applicable services, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy.</p>

                  <p>If you participate in a contest or sweepstakes, or another part of the Service sponsored by a third party, the third party may obtain or collect information about you. Patch does not control how any such third party uses or discloses your information. Be sure to review third party privacy policies to find out how they will collect, use and disclose your information.</p>

                  <p>If you register with Patch and create a profile, the information you provide in your profile and the content you submit, such as posts, photographs and videos, and comments, and classifieds and events you place, will be publicly displayed and published on the Service. Information and content you submit (including classifieds and events) is subject to our
                    <a href="http://corp.patch.com/terms/">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

                  <h3><a name="cookies-beacons">Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies</a></h3>
                  <p>“Cookies” are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer’s browser or your device by a website or service to store your preferences, for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with that website or service or with other websites or services. Many websites, including Patch, may also use Flash cookies, or locally shared objects (“LSOs”), that operate similarly to browser cookies. Patch, or its Partners, may also use “web beacons,” clear GIFs or similar technologies, pieces of information placed on a service or email to track and collect information about user behavior, for example by counting the number of visitors to a web page, delivering a cookie to a user’s browser or tracking open rates, clicks and forwards.</p>

                  <p>Patch, or its Partners, may use cookies and similar technologies to customize your visit to or use of the Service, or to help us to enhance or improve the Service, for example by storing your password or delivering relevant advertising to you when you use the Service. We may also work with our Partners to use such technologies to help them provide advertisements to you when you visit other websites or applications, and to research and analyze how the Service is used, and user response to and interaction with advertisements.</p>

                  <p>Patch may work with our Partners to synchronize unique, non-personally identifiable identifiers in order to match our identifiers with those used by our Partners. These companies may collect and use non-personally identifiable information during your visits to or use of the Service and other websites and apps. The use of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies by such Partners and advertisers is not in Patch’s control and is subject to the privacy policies of such third parties.</p>

                  <p>By accessing or using the Service, you consent to Patch and its Partners using the cookies and other technologies described in this Privacy Policy, and similar technologies that may be developed in the future, to track your activities and use of the Service, including in emails we may send to you.</p>

                  <p>You may be able to set your browser to disable cookies or LSOs, or to refuse certain types of cookies or warn you before accepting cookies. And, LSOs using Adobe Flash can be managed using Flash management tools on the
                    <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Adobe website</a>. However, doing so may mean that certain parts of the Service may not work for you. Some Partners may use technologies other than cookies to recognize your computer or device or to collect information about your use of the Service or other websites or services, and you may not be able to block use of such technologies. Some browsers may transmit “do not track” signals to websites and online services. Patch does not currently take any action or respond to such signals.
                  </p>

                  <p>Patch or its Partners may use mobile Software Development Kits (“SDKs”) to collect information, such as your IDFA or Android Advertising ID, and other information about how your device interacts with the Service. SDKs allow app developers to enable advertising, collection of data and related services and analytics in apps. Patch may use this technology to deliver, or to help Partners deliver, advertising through the Apps and other mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your device. Depending on your device, you may be able to reset your device’s advertising identifier by accessing the privacy settings.</p>

                  <h3>Advertising</h3>
                  <p>Patch and its Partners use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to provide you with advertising that is relevant to you. Some of the Patch Partners that may use cookies and similar technologies on the Service are listed below. We may update this list from time to time, so please review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>

                  <h3>California Residents</h3>
                  <p>California’s "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California residents asking about practices related to disclosing Personal Information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose Personal Information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has opted-out of such information-sharing. Patch has such a policy. If you wish to opt-out of sharing of your Personal Information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes or to find out more about your opt-out rights, please contact us at
