                <div class="sect"><p><strong>PAKYAW Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the PAKYAW website
(collectively, the “Website” located at www.pakyaw.com.ph). Pakyaw.com, Inc., a
company organized under the laws of the Philippines, the provider of the
Website (referred to as “us” or “we”), is committed to protecting your privacy
online. Please read the following to learn what information we collect from you
(the “User” or the “End User”) and how we use that information. If you have any
questions about our privacy policy, please email us.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND TO ALL THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR WEBSITE TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO
NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, EXIT THIS PAGE AND DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Changes to Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy
statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are
aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please
review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will
notify you here, by email, or by means of notice on our home page.</p>
<p><strong>2. Types of Information Collected and Uses of
Collected Information</strong></p>
<p>We collect two types of information about our Website Users: Personally
Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. </p>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>. Personally Identifiable
Information is information that identifies a specific End User. When you engage
in certain activities on the Website, such as creating an account, ordering a
product or service from us or our partners, submitting content and/or posting
content in discussion forums, entering a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by us
or our partners, filling out a survey, posting a review, sending us or our
partners feedback, requesting information about our services, submitting an
affiliate agreement, applying for a job, posting a video or signing up for
special offers from third parties through the Website (collectively,
“Identification Activities”), we may ask you to provide certain information
about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity.
If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you
to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your
first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address,
telephone number and date of birth. When you order products or services, we may
also ask you to provide us with your credit card number, expiration date and
authentication codes or related information. Depending on the activity, some of
the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is
identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a
particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in
that activity.</p>
<p><strong>Tell-A-Friend/Buy it for a Friend</strong>. If you choose to use our
referral service or buy a deal for a friend, we will ask you for your friend's
name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email
with the gift you bought for them or inviting him or her to visit the site. PAKYAW
stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email,
sending their gift, and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>
<p>Your friend may contact us at <img src="/static/img/pakyaw_support.png" align="absmiddle"> to request that we remove this
information from our database.</p>
<p>We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide products and services to you,
administer sweepstakes and contests, enhance the operation of the Website,
improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website use, improve our
product and service offerings, and to tailor your experience with third parties
as provided in Item 3 of this Privacy Policy. For example, if you send our
customer service an email we may use your comments and feedback to tell others
about our services, and may post your comment in our marketing materials or on
our Website. Your comments may contain personal information such as your name,
we will obtain consent from you to post your name along with your comment prior
to posting your comment for public view. In addition, if you use our Website to
send information or a product to another person, we may store your personal
information. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to
troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you,
enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms of Use and this
Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement
activities. </p>
<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>. Non-Personally Identifiable
Information is information that does not identify a specific End User. This
type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator
(“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the
website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are using
and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. We, and/or our authorized Third
Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this
information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like
Cookies, Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described in Items 4 and 8 of this
Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the
Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable
law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this
information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers
to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and
programming. </p>
<p><strong>3. Release of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>We will not share, sell, rent, or trade your Personally Identifiable Information with
other parties except as provided below: </p>
<p><strong>We may share your information with PAKYAW Merchants</strong>. From time to time, we provide offers from particular merchants (referred to as “PAKYAW Merchants”) who, as
part of the offer, request information on PAKYAW customers who purchased the
offer in order to aid redemption. In those cases, we share some of your
Personally Identifiable Information with PAKYAW Merchants. Sharing this
Information may allow a PAKYAW Merchant to market directly to you should they
choose to do so. However, we will only share Personally Identifiable
Information with a PAKYAW Merchant if you engage in an Identification Activity,
and then only to the PAKYAW Merchant involved in that Identification Activity.
We specifically disclaim any responsibility or liability for the actions of
such PAKYAW Merchant. While we inform them that they are only permitted to
communicate with you for the purposes of the specific promotion with PAKYAW, we
do not have any responsibility for the actions of the PAKYAW Merchant, and the
actions of the PAKYAW Merchant are not in our control.</p>
<p><strong>We may share your information with Authorized Third Party Service
Providers</strong>. We provide services and products through third parties. These “Third Party Service Providers” perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing
our administrative and promotional emails. We may share your Personally
Identifiable Information with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, deliver
packages, send postal or email, administer contests or sweepstakes, remove
repetitive information on customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing
assistance, provide search results and links, process credit card payments,
operate the Website, troubleshoot, and provide customer service. We may also
collect personal information from individuals and companies (“Affiliates”) with
whom we have business relationships and may share your information with Service
Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. We encourage PAKYAW Merchants
and Third Party Service Providers to adopt and post privacy policies. However,
the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is governed
by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control. </p>
<p><strong>We may remarket your information</strong>. Remarketing is a way for us to
connect with users, based upon your past interactions with the PAKYAW website.
Third-party marketing vendors may be hired by PAKYAW to perform remarketing
services. This information is used only for remarketing purposes and will not
be used by them for any other purpose.</p>
<p><strong>We may share your information in a Business Transfer</strong>. As with any other business, we
could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the
successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including
Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable
Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p><strong>We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of
Others</strong>. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as
required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our
rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process
served on our Website; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Website Terms
of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the
Website, its Users or others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Release of Non-Personally Identifiable
Information</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Partners,
Affiliates and Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic
information (which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information)
with “Third Party Advertisers” or “Third Party Advertising Companies” and other
parties as provided below:</p>
<p>We use Third Party Advertising Companies to serve ads when you visit our Website.
These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your
visits to this and other websites in order to provide, through the use of
network tags, advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest
to you. We also use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze
Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our
Users to administer our Website and constantly improve its quality. We may also
publish this information for promotional purposes or as a representative
audience for Advertisers. Please note that this is not Personally Identifiable
Information, only general summaries of the activities of our Users. Such data
is collected on our behalf, and is owned and used by us.</p>
<p><strong>5. Updating and Correcting Information</strong></p>
<p>We believe that you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally
Identifiable Information you provide us. You may change any of your Personally
Identifiable Information by logging into your account and accessing the
"my pakyaw" section of the site, sending us an email at <img src="/static/img/pakyaw_support.png" align="absmiddle">
or writing to us at our operations center, 19F Times Plaza Bldg., United
Nations Ave., Ermita, Manila. Please indicate your name, address and email
address, and what information you would like to update when you contact us. </p>
<p>We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it
changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or
removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete
information associated with past transactions on the Website. In addition, in
may be impossible for us to completely delete all of your information because
we periodically backup information.</p>
<p><strong>6. User Choices on Collection and Use of
Information</strong></p>
<p>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although it
may be required to engage in a certain activity on the Website.</p>
<p>As a condition of purchase of our products and services, we will send you
Administrative and Promotional emails. We will send you information regarding
your account activity and purchases as well as updates about our products and
promotional offers. You cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails.
“Administrative Emails” relate to a User’s activity on the Website, and include
emails regarding a particular User’s account, requests or inquiries, and
purchases of products and services. In contrast to Administrative Emails,
however, you do have a choice with respect to Promotional Emails. Promotional
Emails advertise our products and services, including exclusive sales and other
offers, and/or the products and services of our Advertisers and Affiliates. If
you do not want to receive Promotional Emails from us, you may elect to opt-out
of receiving Promotional Emails at any time after registering by e-mailing us
at <img src="/static/img/pakyaw_support.png" align="absmiddle">. When contacting us, please indicate your name,
address, email address, and what Promotional Emails you do not want to receive.
</p>
<p><strong>7. Security of Information</strong></p>
<p>We take security seriously and take numerous precautions to protect the security of
Personally Identifiable Information. You can access your Personally
Identifiable Information on our Website through a password and your email
address. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not share your
password with anyone. In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information
resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have
access to. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be
guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially
reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies
which do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information
transmitted to or from the Website, and are not responsible for the actions of
any third parties that may receive any such information. </p>
<p><strong>8. Data Tracking</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong>. To facilitate and customize your experience with the Website, we store
cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a
User’s computer for record-keeping purposes which contains information about
that User. We use cookies to save you time while using the Website, remind us
who you are, and track and target User interests in order to provide a
customized experience. Cookies also allow us to collect Non-Personally
Identifiable Information from you, like which pages you visited and what links
you clicked on. Use of this information helps us to create a more user-friendly
experience for all visitors. In addition, we may use Third Party Advertising
Companies to display advertisements on our Website. As part of their service,
they may place separate cookies on your computer. We have no access to or control
over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by our
Website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any Advertiser. Most
browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your
browser settings to decline cookies. Please note that if you decline or delete
these cookies, some parts of the Website may not work properly.</p>
<p><strong>Other Tracking Devices</strong>. We may use other industry standard technologies
to track your use of our Website pages and promotions, or we may allow our
Third Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf. </p>
<p><strong>9. Privacy Policies of Third Party Websites</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect
from you on www.pakyaw.com.ph. Other websites that may be accessible through
this Website have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and
disclosure practices. If you link to any such website, we urge you review the
website’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices
of third parties. </p>
<p><strong>10. Miscellaneous Privacy Issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>Children</strong>. Minors under the age of 18 may not use the Website. We do not
knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18, and no
part of the Website is designed to attract anyone under the age of 18. PAKYAW
does not sell products for purchase by children. In certain instances, we sell
children's products for purchase by adults. </p>
<p><strong>Public Areas</strong>. We may provide areas on our Website where you can
publicly post information about yourself, can communicate with others such as
discussion boards or blogs, or can review products, restaurants, and submit
media content. This information may be accessible by other consumers and
companies and may appear on other websites or web searches, and therefore this
information could be read, collected, and used by others. For example, if you
post your email address along with a public restaurant review, you may receive
unsolicited messages. We have no control over who reads your postings or what
other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so please use

<p><strong>Facebook Connect</strong>. The PAKYAW Site allows users to access Facebook
Connect to interact with friends and to share on Facebook through Wall and
friends' News Feeds. If you are logged into PAKYAW and Facebook, when you click
on "Connect with Facebook" your profiles will merge if the email
addresses match. If the email addresses don't match, we ask you if you want to
merge them and you must enter your PAKYAW password to validate that they
control that account. If you are already logged into PAKYAW but not logged into
Facebook, when you click on "Connect with Facebook" you will be prompted
to enter your Facebook credentials or to "Sign up for Facebook." By
proceeding you are allowing the PAKYAW Site to access your information and you
are agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use in your use of PAKYAW Sites.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you are not currently registered as a PAKYAW user and you click on
"Sign in Using Facebook," you will first be asked to enter your
Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join PAKYAW.
Once you register on the PAKYAW site and Connect with Facebook, you will be
able to automatically post recent activity back to Facebook. You have the
option to disable Facebook Connect at any time by logging into "My
Profile" and clicking on "My Facebook Profile." Further, you can
edit privacy settings for the reviews that appear on Facebook or disconnect
this service by visiting the Facebook Application Settings page.</p>
