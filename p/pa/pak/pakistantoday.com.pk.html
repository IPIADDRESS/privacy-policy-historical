	<p>@PTBP. Lets not go back in history. Lets just stick with this case since thats waht everybody seems to be up in arms about. Again, my question is : What exactly did CJ do that is illegal and how is he responsible for his grown, adult son's action? Be specific. What he did in the past has nothing to do with whats being said about him now. I am no fan of CJ myself but I don't see why he is being berated for what his son did. </p>

	<p>Like I said Noman, please no ramblings. Be specific. Your post does not answer my question. Instead, you are going back to 1948. Are you telling me that the charges against this CJ are that he is responsible for what Justice Munir did in 1854? I don't need you to shed a light on Pakistan's history. I just wanted you to tell me how Iftikhar Chaudry is responsible for his son's actions and what law has he broken in this very high profile case that he could be charged with. If you don't have an answer that ok. I don't either :) </p>

	<p>Every one knows who is play back actor. We expect judges to be angles and every one else may do whatever he likes.  The chief justice has stood tall in the past and would  stand tall in the present and future as well. It is a matter of time just wait for few days. </p>

	<p>With every passing day CJ is losing his respect and credibility (Which I doubt were not left any more right from the day he resumed the office).He is just making fool of himself and all the people. 
 
@ Kamran about his challenge that if there are any charges against CJ. I would say that if Mr. Kamran and CJ has any moral courage, than start an independent investigation on the Reference filed by Pevaiz Musharraf on 09-03-2007 which till date has not come up in any court of law. I hope there are enough charges in this reference to satisfy you. By the way i am not a bone head jiyala of PPP as i would be happiest person when this government finishes its tenure. </p>
