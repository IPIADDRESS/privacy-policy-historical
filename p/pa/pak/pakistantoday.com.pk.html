	<p>Wasn't Nawaz Sharif the first to issue an unlawful order to not to allow PIA plane carrying many passengers including the COAS and his entourage,to land anywhere in Pakistan? 
Can a sane PM issue an order to change the COAS while he is returning from an official visit to a friendly country and is still in the air? Can a Pakistani PM order the aircraft carrying those people to be sent to India for all he cared? After all this stupidity tell me which Pakistani patriotic or not would let this happen and then allow such an insane man to stay as PM? Only his family perhaps. Such things do not happen in states with saner persons at the head.Why has NS decided to go to 3rd Nov? Because the noose will be around his neck. </p>

	<p>Biggest stumbling block for pakistan team is misbah.he plays limited over games like test match, leaving rest of the players under stress and in trying to cover for his slow scoring they end up throwing away their wickets cheaply playing overly aggressive until likes of misbah akmals and malik farhat  cheema and many others who seem to be on never ending merry go round of failure/selection are dropped for good pakistan can not succeed.</p>
