	<p>100 % agreed. Very good analysis </p>

	<p>Ambassador Alam, 
I am glad that you are not what I thought when I had a casual look at your name. I confused you with someone who is big in news these day and has the same first name that you have. You understand whom I am talking about.  
Second, and it is with all due respects, Mr. Suhrawardy use to spell his name as “SUHRAWARDY” and not the way you spelled it though I have seen these spellings. But a noun needs to be spelled correctly. Again, please do not consider it to be disrespectful. That is not the intention. 
  </p>

	<p>hmmm so now they arent lotas, coz they are joining pmln but had they joined pti they would have been lotas and corrupt. Pmln is a two faced photocopy league. </p>

	<span>Max</span><br>
	<p>Dr. Ali,  
I fully understand your argument but I have a different take on this matter. The powerful have always aligned with the clergy all through the history and in all societies. Your example of relationship between  Khiji and Nazimuddin Aulyia as well Akbar and his request for support to Khawaja  Salim Chishti and also Moen Chishti  supports my point.  
It is always the deprived who end up paying the price. I wish you may touch some other dreadful events at these khanqas as well as the Hujras of modern day Pir sahiban.  I have heard bizarre stories of happening in these sanctuaries.  Mullah, Monk, Dervaish, Pandit, priest, Granthi, and Rabi are one and same and they all act the same way.  
 </p>

	<span>Imran</span><br>
	<p>Not just doctors, nurses and support staff too. At the same time, Punjab struggled with epidemics like dengue. More importantly, khadim-e-ala didn't consider it an important sector to have a health minister, and ran this ministry through bureaucrats. </p>

	<span>Average Joe</span><br>
	<p>you stupid muslim moron.  the only real God is Jesus Christ.  it is you who should repent for the wickedness that your brethren have committed in the form of terrorism in the name of "jihad".  stop living in lala land and devote your life to peace with the world and a more open relationship with the western societies.  also, stop oppressing freedom and other religions.  oh and stop discriminating against women.  your burqa and hijab are tools of sexism and oppression.  wake up from your silly dream and begin to live in the real world. </p>

	<span>USA!</span><br>
	<p>hey muslim moron.  only 46 non terrorists have been killed by drone strikes this year.  not really close to your "muslim holocaust" is it?  and your religion is false. it is a religion of hate and violence. so "Allah" or whatever will not be punishing anybody ever.  also the US will continue to do whatever we want whenever we want in the air above your country.  I promise that as long as your country continues to harbor terrorists, the United States will continue to rain fire from your skies.  Don't want your people killed? then don't harbor terrorists. </p>

	<span>dhoti_wala</span><br>
	<p>@farmis  what I understand from your comments and news is that MR.Z's blood pressure sinked after receiving a phone call of OBAMA when he talked about stop sending US dollars that are going into his pocket and some into Galani's Pocket. In other words the moment he realized that from now on-ward he has to spend his hard saved corrupt money he" Collapsed" :))) thats interesting  but not uncommon though .. why we are so worried then ....:)))
