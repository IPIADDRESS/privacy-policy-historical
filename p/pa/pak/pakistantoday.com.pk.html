	<span>I Me My</span><br>
	<p>Pakistan can definitely not be complacent; given that has been the target of terrorist violence for the last decade or so.  Furthermore, a  national celebrity such as  Benazir, was assassinated in broad daylight amidst a sea of  people, so there is no way Pakistan can be complacent. In which case the only other option seems 'complicit' and more and more evidence seems to be building in that favor...  </p>
