      <p>4. Our Disclosure of your information : We may also use your  information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, are  targeted to your interests, such as new services and promotions. The  following are examples of some categories of persons to whom we would  share your information with from time-to-time.<br>
        4.1      Advertisements<br>
        a. Where a user enters information on any form of an advertiser, the  information is simultaneously collected by PapyrusClubs.com and the  advertiser. The information is used by PapyrusClubs.com in accordance  with the terms of this privacy policy and is used by the advertiser as  per the advertisers prevalent privacy policies. Because we do not  control the privacy practices of these advertisers, you should evaluate  their practices before deciding to provide the said information.<br>
        b. PapyrusClubs.com may also aggregate (gather up data across all user  accounts) personally identifiable information and disclose such  information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and  other third parties for other marketing and promotional purposes.
        4.2 Internal Service Providers: We may use third parties that we  refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one  or more aspects of the business, product and service operations that we  provide to you on the Website and therefore we may provide some of your  personal information directly to these internal service providers.  These internal service providers′ are subject to confidentiality  agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use  of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to  facilitate the specific outsourced website related operation, unless  you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for  additional uses. In some instances, the internal service provider may  collect information directly from you (such as for website surveys). In  these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal  service provider, and all additional information you provide them and  their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide  additional information to an internal service provider directly, then  their use of your personal information is governed by their applicable  privacy policy.<br>
      4.3 Legal Requests: We co operate with law enforcement inquiries, as  well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual  property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the  community from bad actors. Therefore, in response to a verified request  by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal  investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us  to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address,  UserID history, fraud complaints, and purchase/using Website services’  history without a court order or substantially similar legal  procedure. Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your  privacy and our ability to keep the community  free from bad actors, we  will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law  enforcement or other government officials without a court order or  substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good  faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent  imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal  activity. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name,  street address, city, state, pin code, country, phone number, email,  and company name to Intellectual Property right′s owners under  confidentiality agreement, as we in our sole discretion believe  necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud,  intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity.<br>
        4.4 Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that  all of your private communications and other personal information will  never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy  Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be  forced to disclose personal information to the government or third  parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully  intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users  may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from  the Website. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to  protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect,  that your personal information or private communications will always  remain private.</p>
      <p>5. We ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any  personal information to us. If you are under the age of 18, you cannot  purchase on the Website or use the services on the Website. If you wish  purchase on the Website or use the services such purchase or use of  services may be made by your legal guardian or parents who have  registered as Users of the Website provided that such purchase or use  is not in relation to any adult material/mature audience items  displayed on the Website, the sale or purchase of which to/by minors is  strictly prohibited</p>
        <p>6. To protect your privacy and security, we will verify your identity  before granting access or making changes to your personally-identifying  information. If you have registered your profile on PapyrusClubs.com,  your PapyrusClubs.com User ID and Password are required in order to  access your profile information.</p>
        <p>7. Security: When you place orders or access your account information,  we offer the use of a secure server. Furthermore, all of the customer  data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. To prevent  unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of  information, we will employ reasonable and current Internet security  methods and technologies.</p>
        <p>8. User’s Consent: By using the Website, yout consent to the collection  and use of the information you disclose on the Website. If we decide to  change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so  that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use  it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
