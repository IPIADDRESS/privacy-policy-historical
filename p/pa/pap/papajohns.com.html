by telephone from our restaurants.</font></p><p>
<font face="arial" size="1">Every time you use our service, we collect information about the Papa John's restaurants you select and the orders 
you place.</font></p><p>
<font face="arial" size="1"><b><font color="#006600">We collect additional information about how you use our website and service.</font></b>

<font face="arial" size="1"><b><font color="#006600">Our use of cookies.</font></b>
<br> Like many websites on the Internet, our website uses cookies. Cookies are small strings of data placed on users' personal computer 
hard drives during the exchange of data that happens when your browser points to our website. Cookies enable a website to identify a user's 
browser as a previous visitor by means of a unique string of numbers assigned on a previous visit. Our cookies assist us in collecting information

use cookies to make your experience on papajohns.com more personalized, and convenient.</font></p><p>
<font face="arial" size="1">Our cookies cannot and do not retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses. If you are just

your User ID and Password, we will call up your information from our database to make processing your order faster and easier.</font></p><p>

<font face="arial" size="1"><b><font color="#006600">Promotions and Prizes</font></b>
<br> We search for merchants who sponsor promotions, offer prizes (Contests) or give our customers great discounts that we believe are of 
interest to our users. When we find such merchants, we provide the means on our website, newsletter or emails for our papajohns.com users 
to register for the contests or receive great offers. When you register for a contest, your name and email address are provided to the merchant 
sponsoring the contest.</font></p><p>

please let us know. You can change your preferences, or opt out of receiving emails, at any time (except when you are in the process of placing 
an order) by going to My Account Information on the log in page. There, you can update your email address, phone numbers, password, address and 
you can uncheck the "Send me special offers from Papa John's" box. Our emails to you will stop within 5 business days.</font></p><p>
