<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Paperpile we have a few fundamental
  principles:</p>

  <ul type="disc">

    <li>All content you store in Paperpile <strong>is private by default</strong> and 
      only accessible by you unless you choose to share it with others.

    </li><li>We do not store personal information on our servers unless
    required for the on-going operation of one of our Services.</li>

    <li><strong>We do not store your credit card number</strong>. All payments are
      processed securely by <a href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, a payment provider trusted by
      thousands of small businesses.</li>

    <li>Paperpile connects to your Google Account. We technically
      restrict this access as much as possible and we only ask for
      access to information necessary to run our Service. In
      particular <strong> we don't have access to your e-mail or any
      files stored in Google Drive that you have not uploaded via
        Paperpile </strong>.</li>

    <li>You can choose to import your Gmail contacts to send papers
      via email from within Paperpile. Your contacts will only be
      stored locally on your computer, never on our
      servers. We <strong>will never send emails to your contacts
      unless explicitly initiated by you when you share papers via
      email or invite collaborators to a shared folder.</strong>
    </li>
        
    <li>We do not share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the
    law, or protect our rights. </li>

  </ul>

  <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>

  <p>First published on 3/28/2013. Updated on 01/11/2014.</p>

  <p>Paperpile LLC operates the
  website <a href="http://paperpile.com/">paperpile.com</a>. It is
  Paperpile's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information
  we may collect while operating our websites and services.</p>

  <h3>Service Visitors</h3>

  <p>Like most website operators, Paperpile collects non-personally-identifying information
  of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
  type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor's
  request. Paperpile's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to
  better understand how Paperpile' visitors use our website. From time to time, Paperpile may
  release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a
  report on trends in the usage of our Service and websites.</p>

  <p>Paperpile also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
  Protocol (IP) addresses. However, Paperpile does not use such information to identify its
  visitors and does not disclose such information, other than under the same
  circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as
  described below.</p>

  <p>
    Paperpile uses <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/analytics/tos.html">Google Analytics</a>, a web
    analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google
    Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer,
    to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the
    cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted
    to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this
    information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports
    on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to
    website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information
    to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process
    the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with
    any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting
    the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you
    may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. By using this
    website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and
    for the purposes set out above.
  </p>

<p> Paperpile uses Mixpanel, an advanced analytics service provided
by Mixpanel, Inc. ("Mixpanel") that helps improve web and mobile
applications by tracking how users interact and engage. Usage
information and Personal Data is stored by Mixpanel and is subject to
their privacy policy. You can view their privacy policy
at <a href="https://mixpanel.com/privacy">https://mixpanel.com/privacy</a>.</p>

<p>Paperpile uses Intercom, a third party communication and analytics
service provided by Intercom, Inc. ("Intercom") to help understand
your use of our services and to communicate with you by sending you
service-related notifications in the Paperpile interface. Paperpile
uses Intercom to collect data for analytics purposes when you use our
services. Intercom analyzes your use of our website and/or service and
our relationship with you, so that we can improve our services. For
more information on the privacy practices of Intercom, please check
<a href="http://docs.intercom.io/privacy">http://docs.intercom.io/privacy</a>. Intercom’s
services are governed by Intercom’s terms of use, which can be found
at <a href="http://docs.intercom.io/terms">http://docs.intercom.io/terms</a>.</p>

  <p>
    Your Paperpile content (references, notes, files etc.) is not shared with
    Google Analytics, Mixpanel or Intercom.
  </p>

  <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

  <p>Certain visitors to Paperpile's websites choose to interact with Paperpile in ways that
  require Paperpile to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
  information that Paperpile gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example,
  we ask visitors who sign up for an account at <a href="http://www.paperpile.com/">Paperpile</a> to provide a username and email address (directly or via their Google account, see below).
  Those who engage in financial transactions with Paperpile are asked to provide additional
  information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
  process those transactions. In each case, Paperpile collects such information only
  insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's
  interaction with Paperpile. Paperpile does not disclose personally-identifying information
  other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply
  personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from
  engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

  <h3>Payment processing</h3>

  Paperpile uses Stripe to process and manage payments. The use of
  your personal information by Stripe is governed by their privacy
  policy: <a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy">https://stripe.com/us/privacy</a>.
  Paperpile does not store credit card numbers at any time.

  <h3>Paperpile and Google Services</h3>

<p>
  The sign-in process to Paperpile is handled through the visitor's
  Google account. Paperpile follows the guidelines provided by Google
  for the secure OAuth 2.0 authentication and authorization
  protocol. At not time Paperpile has access or stores any passwords
  associated with the Google account. If a visitor chooses to sign-in
  to Paperpile via a Google account, the visitor will be asked
  explicitly to grant permission to access certain information and
  services associated with this Google account. The visitor can review
  the permissions and deny access at this point. In addition, the
  visitor can revoke the access at any later point
  here: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/account">https://www.google.com/settings/account</a>.
  Paperpile only asks for information or services required to run the
  Paperpile service and only has access to information the user has
  explicitly granted access to. Notably, Paperpile does not have - at
  any time - read or write access to the visitor's e-mail data in
  Gmail or any data stored in Google Drive except files that have been
  uploaded to Google Drive by the user via the Paperpile service. You
  can optionally import your contacts from Gmail into Paperpile. The
  sole purpose of this function is to make it easier for you to send
  papers by email to your contacts or invite your contacts to shared
  folders. Paperpile stores your contact list only locally on your
  computer. Your contact list is never sent to Paperpile's servers or
  stored there. Paperpile will never send emails to your contacts
  unless explicitly initiated by you when you share papers with the
  email function or invite your contacts to a shared folder.
</p>

  <h3>Browser Extensions</h3>

  <p>
  Paperpile provides downloadable software that can be installed in
  the visitor's web-browser ("Chrome Extension"). The main purpose of
  the Chrome extension is to enable advanced functionality on third
  party sites such as PubMed or Google Scholar. The Chrome Extension
  accesses third party sites with the purpose to search for scientific
  documents or reference data. No other data is accessed or
  transmitted to the Paperpile's servers.
  </p>

  <h3>Google Docs plugin</h3>

  <p>The Google Docs plugin allows the users of Paperpile to format
    citations and bibliographies in their Google Documents. For that
    purpose it uses a so-called "Apps Script", a small program that
    runs on Google's servers. The Apps Script has access to the
    content of the Google Document. However, it does not transmit any
    content to the Paperpile servers beyond what is technically
    necessary. At the moment only the name of the document and the
    list of citations are transmitted to the Paperpile servers.</p>
  <p>The Apps Script needs to be authorized separately from the user's
  Paperpile account and if the user chooses not to authorize the Apps
  Script the Paperpile Service remains fully functional with the
  exception of the functions of the Google Docs plugin. More
  information on Apps Scripts is
  available <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/">here</a>. No
  other component of the Paperpile Service has access to the content
  of the user's Google Documents.</p>

  <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

  <p>Paperpile may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For
  instance, Paperpile may monitor the most popular <i>public</i> Content on the
  Paperpile Service or use usage statistics to measure how our user base grows. Paperpile
  may display this aggregated, non-personalized information publicly or provide it to
  third parties. However, Paperpile does not disclose personally-identifying information
  other than as described below.</p>

  <h3>Protection of Personal Information within Paperpile and our Contractors</h3>

  <p>With "Personal Information" we understand potentially personally-identifying,
  information and Content which you created and that you stored on our Service.</p>

  <p>Paperpile has employees who work on the Service and works with contractors who improve
  or maintain parts of the Service. For example, the server hardware running the Service
  is provided by a contractor.</p>

  <p>Paperpile discloses Personal Information only to those of its <strong>employees and
  contractors</strong> that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on
  Paperpile's behalf or to provide additional features available through Paperpile's Service,
  and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to third parties.</p>

  <p>Some of those employees and contractors may be located outside of your home country;
  by using Paperpile's Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
  Paperpile will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
  personally-identifying information to any third party. Other than to its employees,
  contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Paperpile discloses
  potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when
  required to do so by law, or when Paperpile believes in good faith that disclosure is
  reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Paperpile, third parties or the
  public at large. <strong>If you are a registered user of a Paperpile Service and have
  supplied your email address, you explicitly agree that Paperpile may occasionally send
  you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up
  to date with what's going on with Paperpile and our Products.</strong> We primarily use
  our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep
  this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support
  email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in
  order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
  Paperpile takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized
  access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
  personally-identifying information.</p>

  <h3>Protection of Shared and Public Content</h3>

  <p>We would like to protect shared Content the same way as personal Content is
  protected. As we cannot control what the recipients of your shared Content do with the
  Content, this is not possible. From our side, we restrict access to shared Content the
  same way we restrict your Personal Information.</p>

  <p>Content which you published for the general public to see can be retrieved by the
  public and is therefore excluded from our privacy policy and confidentiality.</p>

  <h3>Analyzing the Data to Optimize the Service</h3>

  <p>We are continually optimizing and improving the Service for you. To analyze the data, we are
  using our own software and software of third parties. </p>

  <p>To improve the software and to gain scientific insight, anonymous statistical
  information will be passed on to third parties, especially to providers of software
  which we use. This statistical information is not "Personal Information" under above
  definition; especially it is not potentially personally-identifying and does not
  include your Content or parts thereof.</p>

  <h3>Cookies</h3>

  <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer,
  and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
  Paperpile uses cookies to help Paperpile identify and track visitors, their usage of
  Paperpile Service, and their Service access preferences. Paperpile visitors who do not wish
  to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies
  before using Paperpile's Services, with the drawback that certain features of Paperpile's
  Services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

  <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

  <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Paperpile may change its Privacy Policy
  from time to time, and in Paperpile's sole discretion. Paperpile encourages visitors to
  frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a
  Paperpile account, you should also check your personal profile for alerts to these
  changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will
  constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
