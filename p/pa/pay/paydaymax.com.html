<h1>PayDayMax<sub>Â®</sub> Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>At PayDayMax your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect and how we use that information. It applies if you have applied for service through the PayDayMax.com website, or if you are a current customer.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
    <strong>PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION</strong>
  	<p>PayDayMax is committed to protecting your privacy and providing a secure online experience. PayDayMax maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with U.S. standards to transmit and store information about you.</p>  
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</strong>
    <p>We collect "nonpublic personal information" about you from several sources:</p>
      <ol style="padding-bottom: 2.0em;">
        <li>Information you provide on your application </li>
        <li>Your transaction and experience history </li>
        <li>Information from consumer reporting and similar agencies </li>
        <li>Non-personally identifiable information such as URL and TCP/IP information </li>
      </ol> 
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong>
    <p>The information we collect about you is primarily used to provide services to you or to facilitate loans, loan applications, or other services that you request. We may also use your information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our agreements with you. Although we may disclose information we collect and retain, its use will be limited to what we reasonably believe is appropriate and necessary to carry on our business and to facilitate your application for the services and/or products you expect and deserve. In addition, unless you opt-out as specified herein, we may share the information with affiliates or other companies who we believe in our sole discretion may offer goods or services that you might find of interest.</p> 
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>PARTIES TO WHOM WE DISCLOSE</strong>
    <p>
      <strong>Information we share with Affiliates:</strong> <br>
      Some of our products or services may be provided by our affiliates, network lenders and/or assignees.  We reserve the right to share your collected non-public personal information with them as necessary to fulfill your request.  You may not opt-out of this sharing of information if you apply through our web site.
    </p>
    <p>    
      <strong>Information we share with Third Parties:</strong> <br>
      Some of our services may be provided by third-party service providers and we reserve the right to share your non-public information with them. We may also share the non-public information we collect from you with consumer reporting and related agencies. You may not opt-out of this sharing of information if you apply through our website. Finally, we may share the non-public information we collect from you with companies or organizations with whom we have a marketing or other agency relationship, generally to offer you goods or services in which we believe you may have an interest. You have the right to opt-out of this sharing of information as set forth within the section that explains your opt-out rights.
    </p>
  </li>
	<li>
    <strong>INFORMATION OR EMAIL FROM US</strong>
    <p>We may send you email regarding our services or those of our affiliates from time to time. We may also send out periodic emails informing you of technical service issues related to a service you requested. You will not be able to choose to opt-out of these electronic mailings, if you apply for service with us, because they are considered an essential part of the service(s) you have chosen.</p>  
  </li>  
  <li>
    <strong>OPT-OUT RIGHTS</strong>
    <p>You may opt-out of receiving any communications from us, or our affiliates, by choosing not to submit your information to us. If you do submit your information to us or you do apply for services, you will be given the option to opt-out of having your personal information transferred to any non-essential third party by accessing your account options and clicking on the appropriate box (after which your opt-out election will take effect.)</p> 
  </li>
	<li>
	  <strong>ACCURACY OF YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION</strong>  
    <p>We have established procedures to ensure that your financial information is accurate, current and complete, in keeping with reasonable industry standards. We continually strive to maintain complete and accurate information about you and your accounts. Should you ever believe that our records contain inaccurate or incomplete information about you, please notify us. We will investigate your concerns and correct any information we determine to be inaccurate. </p>
  </li>  	
  <li>
	  <strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
		<p>Since circumstances and technologies change, we reserve the right to change or remove portions of our Privacy Policy at any time without prior notification. If the changes are substantial, such as adding a category of information that we will disclose to a third party, we will notify existing customers by email and give them an appropriate time period to opt out of the disclosure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
	  <strong>ADDITIONAL SECURITY PRECAUTIONS</strong>
		<p>You also have a significant role in protecting your information. Do not share your login information with others. If you use this site you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account, password, and restricting access to your computer. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account and password.</p>
  </li>
	<li>
