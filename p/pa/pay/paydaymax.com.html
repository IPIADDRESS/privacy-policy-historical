If you choose not to accept cookies from PayDayMax you may not have access to use all or part of our site or you may not benefit fully from the information and services offered.</p>
			<p>PayDayMax's advertising service providers may serve advertising through the use of web beacons. A web beacon is placed on a web page and, in addition to setting HTML cookies, can capture information such as IP address, time, web browser, time zone and domain.

		<li>
			<p><b>Advertising</b></p>
			<p>PayDayMaxâ€™s advertising service providers advertise our services on websites not affiliated with us.

			<p>Some ads that you receive are customized based on your visits over time and across different Web sites. This type of customization â€“ sometime referred to as behavioral or interest-based advertising â€“ is enabled through your computer browser and browser cookies.

			<p>Please note that if you opt out, you may still receive online advertising from PayDayMax. Opting out from a specific advertising provider means that the ads you do receive will not be based on your preferences or behavior. In order for behavioral advertising opt-outs to work on the computer you are using, your browser must be set to accept cookies. <b>If you delete cookies, buy a new computer, access the site from a different computer, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers you will need to opt out again.</b> If the browser you are using has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check the browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.</p>
