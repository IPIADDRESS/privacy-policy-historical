</p><ul>
	<li>We do not sell, rent, trade or share your personally identifiable information with anyone.</li>
	<li>We do not provide advertisers with personally identifiable information of any kind.</li>
	<li>We do not engage in, or support others in, the sending of unsolicited e-mail.</li>

	<li>We utilize secure encryption technology and structural privacy techniques, to protect information on our system.</li>
</ul>

For more information on safe surfing, from the Federal Trade Commission <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee/index.html">click here</a>. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy: 
<p>
<b>What this Privacy Policy Covers</b><br>
</p><ul><li>This Privacy Policy covers PayScale's treatment of personally identifiable information that is collected when you are on the PayScale site, and when you use PayScale's services.  This policy also covers PayScale's treatment of any personally identifiable information that PayScale's business partners share with PayScale.
</li><li>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that PayScale does not own, or to individuals that PayScale does not employ.
</li></ul>
<b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
Our primary purpose for collecting personal information is to provide you with the services and features that best fill your compensation information needs.
<ul><li>PayScale collects personally identifiable information when you register for a PayScale account, when you use certain PayScale products or services, and when you visit PayScale pages. PayScale may also receive personally identifiable information from our business partners. 
</li><li>When you register with PayScale, the system asks for your email address and password. Subsequently, the system asks for detailed job and compensation information through a job profile survey that is used to generate your personal compensation report. Once you register with PayScale and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.
</li><li>PayScale automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, PayScale cookie information and the page you requested.
</li><li>PayScale uses information for four general purposes: (a) to average your compensation information with others in order to generate personalized compensation reports, (b) to customize the content you see, (c) to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and (d) to contact you about special offers and new products. </li></ul>

<b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b><br>
We are sensitive to your desire to limit the intrusiveness of advertising in your daily lives and respect your privacy. We do not sell, rent, trade or share your personally identifiable information with any other business. You will not receive unwanted third-party advertisements by e-mail or mail as a result of information submitted to our website. If you have any questions or concerns related to this issue, you may contact us at <img src="/images/svc-addr.gif" border="0" width="137" height="15">.

<ul>
	<li>PayScale will not sell, rent, trade or share your personally identifiable information with any other business.
	</li><li>PayScale does not provide advertisers with personally identifiable information of any kind.</li>
	<li>PayScale will not send personally identifiable information about you to other companies.</li>
	<li>PayScale may send personally identifiable information about you when: 
		<ul>
			<li>We have your consent to share the information;</li>
			<li>We must respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or </li>
			<li>We find that your actions on our web sites violate the <a href="/license.asp">PayScale License Agreement</a>, or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services. </li>
		</ul>
</li></ul>

<a name="answerminimum"></a><b>Data Minimums &amp; "Data withheld for Privacy" message</b><br>
<ul><li>To protect the privacy and rights of both individuals and companies, PayScale only displays data that is an average or "aggregate" of multiple data points. When viewing a report you may see the message "Data point withheld for privacy." This mask is not removed until there is sufficient data in the system to create an average, thus preventing the identification of personally identifiable information.</li></ul>

<b>Your Use of PayScale Information</b><br>
<ul><li>In order to enable the attribute-matching features of the PayScale system, users running a PayScale Report™ receive limited access to questionnaire data in the form of generic peer profiles. While these profiles include data on job, compensation, geographic location, skills, experience, education and demographic information, the intent of the PayScale service is that this information is not traceable to any particular user. Use of the system signifies an understanding of the source of the data and an agreement on the part of the user to both access and share anonymous user data.</li></ul>

<b>Cookies</b><br>
<ul><li>PayScale may set and access payscale.com cookies on your computer.  
</li><li>PayScale may from time to time allow other companies that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.  Advertisers or other companies do not have access to PayScale's cookies.
</li><li>PayScale may from time to time use web beacons to access our cookies within our network of web sites and in connection with PayScale products and services.</li></ul>

<b>Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences</b><br>
<ul><li>PayScale gives you the complete ability to edit your <a href="/profile.asp">PayScale Account Information</a> and preferences at any time, including whether you want PayScale to contact you about specials and new products.
</li><li>You may request deletion of your PayScale account by sending an email to <img src="/images/rm-addr.gif" border="0" width="154" height="15">. (After your account has been deleted, your profile information may possibly remain in our archived records.)</li></ul>

<b>Security</b><br>
<ul><li>Your PayScale Account Information is password-protected for your privacy and security.  
</li><li>In certain areas PayScale uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions.</li></ul>

<b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b><br>
<ul><li>PayScale may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages.
</li></ul>
<b>Questions or Suggestions</b><br>
<ul><li>If you have questions or suggestions please send email to <img src="/images/svc-addr.gif" border="0" width="137" height="15">.</li>
