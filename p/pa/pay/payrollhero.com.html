                    PayrollHero has implemented technology and security features
                    to safeguard the privacy of your personal information. A
                    secure server protects your personal information.
                    Additionally, with PayrollHero, you can be assured that the
                    information you provide to PayrollHero is transmitted using
                    Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. If you become aware of
                    any security breach, please let us know as soon as possible.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    We have internal procedures in place requiring our employees
                    and data processors to respect the confidentiality of any
                    personal information held by PayrollHero.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    PayrollHero will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to
                    keep secure any information which we hold about you. Your
                    information is stored on secure servers that are protected
                    in controlled facilities. Unfortunately, despite the
                    aforementioned technology and security features, no data
                    transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%
                    secure, so we cannot give an absolute assurance that the
                    information you provide to us will be secure at all times,
                    and we cannot be responsible for any event arising from
                    unauthorised access to your personal information.
                    PayrollHero will not be held responsible for events arising
                    from third parties gaining unauthorized access to your
                    personal information.

                  <p>
                    Please note also that PayrollHero may use overseas
                    facilities to process or back up its information. As a
                    result, we may transfer and store your personal information
                    to our overseas facilities. However, this does not change
                    any of our commitments to safeguard your privacy.

                  <p>
                    You can play your part in safeguarding your personal
                    information by never disclosing your username, password or
                    account information to anybody. Whenever you login as a user
                    on PayrollHero, particularly on somebody else’s computer or
                    on public internet terminals, you should always logout at
                    the end of your session. Your assistance will help us
                    protect the privacy of your personal information.

                    PayrollHero cannot be held responsible for lapses in
                    security caused by third party accesses to information as a
                    result of your failure to keep your personal information
                    private. Please notify us immediately if there is any
                    unauthorised use of your account by any other internet user
                    or any other breach of security.

                    PayrollHero may amend this Policy from time to time. If we
                    make any substantial changes in any way we use your personal
                    information, we will notify you by posting a prominent
                    announcement on our web pages or by way of an e-mail and you
