      PaySchools knows that you care how your information is used and 
      shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and 
      sensibly. This notice explains our privacy policy. By visiting 
      PaySchools, you are accepting all the practices described in this 
      privacy notice. <br>
      <br>
      <b>What Personal Information About Customers Does PaySchools Gather?</b><br>
      <br>
      The information we learn from customers helps us personalize your shopping 
      experience at PaySchools. Here are the types of information we gather.
      <br>
      <br>
      Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on 
      our Web site or give us in any other way, except bank and credit card 
      information. We do not save or store bank or credit card information. You 
      can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be 
      able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information 
      that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, 
      processing your orders, and communicating with you.</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Verdana">We receive and store certain types of 
      information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web 
      sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when 
      your Web browser accesses PaySchools from a member institution. We 
      also use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make products 
      available to you if offered by the participating institution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What About Cookies? </b><br>
      <br>
      Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's 
      hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize 
      your browser and to provide features such as shopping carts, automatic 
      credit of accounts at Member Institutions, and access to 
      your personal profile.</font></p>
      <p align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Verdana">The Help portion of the toolbar on most 
      browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new 
      cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, 
      or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies are necessary to 
      add items to your shopping cart at PaySchools so we recommend that you 
      leave them turned on. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Does PaySchools Share the Information It Receives?</b><br>
      <br>
      We share customer information only as described below.<br>
      <br>
      Protection of PaySchools and Others: We release account and other 
      personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with 
      the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or 
      protect the rights, property, or safety of PaySchools, our users, or 
      others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and 
      organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, 
      however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise 
      disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for 
      commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this 
      Privacy Notice.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We share information regarding 
      your purchase with the member institution who is selling the item(s) purchased.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>How Secure Is Information About Me? </b><br>
      <br>
      We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by 
      using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you 
      input.
      Of course, we transmit your entire credit card number to the appropriate 
      credit card company during order processing, but after that transmission, 
      your credit card number is discarded. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is important for you to 
      protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. 
      Be sure to sign out when finished using a shared computer. Sign out by 
      clicking the "sign out" link on every page.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Which Information Can I Access?</b><br>
      <br>
      PaySchools gives you access to a broad range of information about your 
      account and your interactions with PaySchools for the limited purpose 
      of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>What Choices Do I Have? </b>
      <br>
      <br>
      As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even 
      though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of 
      PaySchools features.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You can add or update your 
      profile information.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Help portion of the 
      toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from 
      accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive 
      a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies are 
      required to make purchases through PaySchools<br>
      <br>
      <b>Children</b><br>
      <br>
      PaySchools does not sell products for purchase by children. We may 
      sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you 
      may use PaySchools only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions </b><br>
      <br>
      If you choose to visit PaySchools, your visit and any dispute over 
      privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including 
      limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the 
      law of the state of Iowa. If you have any concern about privacy at 
      PaySchools, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will 
      try to resolve it. <br>
      <br>
      Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Conditions 
      of Use will change also. You should check our Web site frequently to see 
      recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice 
      applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We 
      stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially 
      change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer 
      information collected in the past without the consent of affected 
      customers. <br>
