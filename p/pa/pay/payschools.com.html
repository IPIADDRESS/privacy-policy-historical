          appreciate your trust that we will use and share information cautiously and only 
          in accordance with the law. This Notice of Privacy Policy describes what types 
          of information PaySchools gathers, and states the circumstances under which 
          PaySchools will, or will not, share such information. By visiting PaySchools, 
          you are accepting all the practices described in this Notice of Privacy Policy. </font></p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

<p><b>What Personal Information About Customers Does PaySchools Gather?</b></p>

<p>The information we learn from and about customers helps us personalize your 
    shopping experience at PaySchools. Here are the types of information we gather. </p>

<p><i>Information You Provide.</i> We receive and store any information you enter on 
    our website or give us in any other way, <u>except bank and credit card 
    information.</u> We do not save or store bank or credit card information. You 
    can choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to 
    access the full functionality of PaySchools. We use the information that you 
    provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, processing your 
    orders, and communicating with you.</p>
<p><i>Information We Gather.</i> We gather and store certain types of information 
    whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies" 
    to obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses PaySchools 
    from a member institution. We also use cookies to keep track of your shopping 
    cart and to make products available to you if and when they are offered by a 
    participating institution.</p>

<p><b>What Are Cookies?</b></p>

<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard 
    drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser 
    and to provide features such as shopping carts, automatic credit of accounts at 
    member institutions, and access to your personal profile.</p>
<p>The "Help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent 
    your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when 
    you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies 
    are necessary to add items to your shopping cart at PaySchools. If you disable 
    your browser from accepting all cookies, or prevent it from accepting cookies 
    from PaySchools, you will not be able to access PaySchools’ full functionality, 
    including the ability to add items to the shopping cart. </p>

<p><b>Does PaySchools Share the Information It Receives?</b></p>

<p>We share customer information only as described below.</p>

<p><i>Protection of PaySchools and Others.</i> We release account and other personal 
    information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; to 
    enforce or apply our Terms &amp; Conditions of Use and other agreements; or to 
    protect the rights, property, or safety of PaySchools, our users, or others. 
    This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for 
    fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does <b><u>not</u></b> 
    include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally 
    identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of 
    the commitments set forth in this Notice of Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>Furthermore, and with respect to credit card transaction, we do <b><u>not</u></b> use, 
    disclose, sell or disseminate any cardholder information obtained in connection 
    with a credit card transaction (including the names, addresses and card account 
    numbers of cardholders) except for the limited purpose of authorizing, 
    completing, and settling card transactions and resolving any chargebacks, 
    retrieval requests, or similar issues involving card transactions.</p>
<p>We share information regarding your purchase with the member institution who is 
    selling the item(s) purchased. </p>

<p><b>How Secure Is Information About Me? </b></p>

<p>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using 
    Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. Of 
    course, we transmit your entire credit card number to the appropriate credit 
    card company during order processing, but your credit card number is not stored 
    by us. </p>
<p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password 
    and to your computer. Be sure to sign out when finished using a shared computer. 
    Sign out by clicking the "sign out" link on every page.</p>

<p><b>Which Information Can I Access?</b></p>

<p>PaySchools gives you access to a broad range of information about your account 
    and your interactions with PaySchools for the limited purpose of viewing and, in 
    certain cases, updating that information.</p>

<p><b>What Choices Do I Have? </b></p>

<p>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, and you may 
    disable your browser from receiving cookies. However, withholding information or 
    preventing your computer from receiving cookies may prevent you from 
    successfully using some or all of the PaySchools features.</p>
<p>The "Help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent 
    your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when 
    you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies 
    are required to make purchases through PaySchools</p>
<p>You can add or update your profile information.</p>

<p><b>Children</b></p>

<p>PaySchools does <b><u>not</u></b> sell products for purchase by children. We may sell 
    children’s products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use 
    PaySchools only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. </p>

<p><b>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions </b></p>

<p>If you choose to visit PaySchools, your visit and any dispute over privacy is 
    subject to this Notice of Privacy Policy and our Terms &amp; Conditions of Use, 
    including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of 
    the law of the state of Iowa. If you have any concern about privacy at 
    PaySchools, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to 
    resolve it. </p>

<p>Our business changes constantly, and our Notice of Privacy Policy and the Terms &amp; 
    Conditions of Use may change also, with or without notice. You should check our 
    website frequently to review any recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our 
    current Notice of Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about 
    you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will 
    never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective 
    of customer information without notice to and consent of effected customers. </p>
