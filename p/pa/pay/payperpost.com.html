		<h2>Collecting and Using Your Information</h2>
		<p>Through your registration for an account or otherwise providing any personal information to us, we may collect information you provide, as well as through placement of cookies or other tracking software on your computer to allow us to provide better service to you and our other customers.</p>
		<p>Specifically, when you sign up for a PayPerPost Account, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, address, email address and an account password).  We will also request PayPal payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers.  When you visit www.PayPerPost.com, we may place one or more cookies on your computer to uniquely identify your browser.  We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, such as how people blog.  You may chose to set your computer to not accept cookies but some PayPerPost features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.  In addition, PayPerPost may track your usage of our site, communications sent to PayPerPost or use of linked or related sites pertaining to our services and blogging. </p>
		<p>PayPerPost uses the information it collects to provide its services and remuneration, as well as to determine the use of our sites and to monitor, audit and analyze information pertaining to our business metrics.</p>

		<h2>Sharing of Your Information</h2>
		<p>PayPerPost only shares personal information with our parent, subsidiary, affiliated companies, or other trusted companies when you provide opt-in consent or if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information will not violate applicable law, regulations or rules.</p>
		<p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually. </p>

		<h2>Security Pertaining to Your Information</h2>
		<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. </p>
		<p>We restrict access to personal information to PayPerPost employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>

		<h2>Integrity of Your Data </h2>
		<p>PayPerPost processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy.  We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services.  We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. </p>

		<h2>Changes to this policy </h2>
		<p>Please note that we may change this Privacy Policy at various times.  We expect most such changes will be minor, but we cannot guarantee that will be the case.  Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, if we deem it appropriate, email notification of Policy changes).</p>
