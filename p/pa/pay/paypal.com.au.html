Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received from verified PayPal users, and whether you have verified control of a bank account are provided to other PayPal users with whom who you transact through PayPal. In addition, this and other information may also be shared with third parties when you use these third parties to access PayPal Services. Unless you have agreed to it, these third parties are not allowed to use this information for any purpose other than to enable PayPal Services.<br> </p> <p>If someone is sending you money and enters your email address, we will provide them your registered name so they can verify they are sending the money to the correct account.<br> </p> <p>If you are buying goods or services and pay through PayPal, we may also provide the seller with your shipping and billing address to help complete your transaction. The seller is not allowed to use this information to market their services to you unless you have agreed to it. If an attempt to pay your seller fails, or is later invalidated, we may also provide your seller with details of the unsuccessful payment. To facilitate dispute resolution, we may provide a buyer with the seller’s address so that goods can be returned to the seller.<br> </p> <p>We work with third parties, including merchants, to enable them to accept or send payments from or to you using PayPal. In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number, to inform you that a payment has been sent to you or when you attempt to pay a merchant or third party. We use this information to confirm that you are a PayPal customer and that PayPal as a form of payment can be enabled, or to send you notification of payment status. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a PayPal customer with a third party, we will do so.<br> </p> <p>Please note that merchants, sellers, and users you buy from or contract with have their own privacy policies, and although PayPal’s User Agreement does not allow the other transacting party to use this information for anything other than providing PayPal Services, PayPal is not responsible for their actions, including their information protection practices.<br> </p> <p>Regardless, we will not disclose your credit card number or bank account number to anyone you have paid or who has paid you using PayPal, or with the third parties that offer or use PayPal Services, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with credit card rules, a subpoena, or other legal process.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p> </div> <a class="catWidget" name="How_we_share_personal_information_with_other_parties"></a> <h3>How we share personal information with other parties<br> </h3> <div style="margin-left: 20px;"> <p>We may share your personal information with:</p> <ol type="disc"> <li>Members of the eBay Inc. corporate family -- like eBay, StubHub or Bill Me Later, Inc.-- to provide joint content, products, and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about their products, services, and communications. Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you have requested their services.</li> <li>Service providers under contract who help with our business operations such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, and technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.</li> <li>Financial institutions that we partner with to jointly create and offer a product. These financial institutions may only use this information to market PayPal-related products, unless you have given consent for other uses.</li> <li>Credit reporting bodies and collection agencies to report account information, as permitted by law.

However, we will ensure that we comply with our Binding Corporate Rules and also take reasonable steps to ensure the third parties do not breach the Australian Privacy Principles in relation to the personal information.</p> <p>PayPal will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes and only shares your personal information with third parties as described in this policy.<br> <br> If you open a PayPal account directly on a third party website or via a third party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on a PayPal website) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or application. These sites are governed by their own privacy policies and you are encouraged to review their privacy policies before providing them with personal information. PayPal is not responsible for the content or information practices of such third parties.</p> <p>If you link your loyalty card to your PayPal account in our mobile app, we may share your loyalty card number with the relevant merchant when you pay that merchant using PayPal.&nbsp; If you remove your loyalty card from your account, we will stop sharing this information.</p> </div> <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <a class="catWidget" name="Using_Log_In_with_PayPal"></a> <h3>Using Log In with PayPal<br> </h3> <div style="margin-left: 20px;"><p>Log In with PayPal is a tool we’ve developed to improve your Internet experience.
