<h2>How does Payless.com protect my privacy?</h2>
<p>We want your online shopping to be worry-free, so we limit access to nonpublic customer information only to those employees who need the information to do their jobs.

<p>We use SSL (Secure Socket Layers), the most advanced online ordering security system available. All of your personal information, including your credit card number, is encrypted by SSL.</p>
<p>SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than Payless.com. To check the security of your connection, look for an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your web browser). This and a change in the first characters of the site address from "http" to "https" alert you that SSL is active.</p>
