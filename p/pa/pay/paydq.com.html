        <p><strong>Updated September 26, 2007.</strong> PAYDQ is committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of your customers. Please note, this privacy statement pertains to this website only.</p>
<h2>Collection of your Personal Information</h2>
<p>We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you to provide a service or carry out a transaction that you have requested such as receiving information about PAYDQ products and services, ordering e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access service, signing up for an event or training, or when purchasing, downloading and/or registering PAYDQ products. The personal information we collect may include your name, title, company or organization name, work e-mail, work phone, work or home address, information about your job function and information about your company.</p>
<p>The Site may collect certain information about your visit such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Site; the pages that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Site. This information is used to help improve the Site, analyze trends, and administer the Site. </p>
<h2>Use of Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>The personal information collected on this Site will be used to operate the Site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized.</p>
<p>In support of these uses, PAYDQ may use personal information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the Site and any related PAYDQ products or services, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Site to your particular preference or interests.</p>
<p>PAYDQ may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on PAYDQ or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of PAYDQ and our family of websites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of PAYDQ employees or agents, users of PAYDQ products or services, or members of the public.</p>
<h2>Control of Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide on the Site will not be shared outside of PAYDQ and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission. As described below in the next section, you can access your personal information and make choices about how you wish to be contacted.</p>

<h2>Security of Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>PAYDQ is committed to protecting the security of your personal information and that of your customers. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities.

<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
<p>We do not use cookies on this Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a Web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation and so on.

<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other websites you visit. </p>
