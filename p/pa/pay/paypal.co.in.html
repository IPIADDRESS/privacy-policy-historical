We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user.<br> <br> We store and process your personal information on our computers in the US, Asia, Europe and elsewhere in the world where our facilities are located. We protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls.</p> </div> <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><a class="catWidget" name="5"></a><h3>How we use the personal information we collect</h3> <div style="margin-left: 20px;"><p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We may use your personal information to:</p> <ul> <li>provide PayPal Services and customer support;</li> <li>process transactions and send notices about your transactions;</li> <li>resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;</li> <li>prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement;</li> <li>customize, measure, and improve PayPal Services and the content, layout, and operation of our websites and applications;</li> <li>deliver targeted marketing, service update notices, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences;</li> <li>contact you at any telephone number, by placing a voice call or through text (SMS) or email messaging, as authorized by our User Agreement;</li> <li>compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.</li> </ul> </div> <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><a class="catWidget" name="6"></a><h3>Marketing</h3> <div style="margin-left: 20px;"><p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.

Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received from verified PayPal users, and whether you have verified control of a bank account are provided to other PayPal users with whom who you transact through PayPal. In addition, this and other information may also be shared with third parties when you use these third parties to access PayPal Services. Unless you have agreed to it, these third parties are not allowed to use this information for any purpose other than to enable PayPal Services.<br> <br> If someone is sending you money and enters your email address, we will provide them your registered name so they can verify they are sending the money to the correct account.<br> <br> If you are buying goods or services and pay through PayPal, we may also provide the seller with your shipping and billing address to help complete your transaction. The seller is not allowed to use this information to market their services to you unless you have agreed to it. If an attempt to pay your seller fails, or is later invalidated, we may also provide your seller with details of the unsuccessful payment. To facilitate dispute resolution, we may provide a buyer with the seller’s address so that goods can be returned to the seller.<br> <br> We work with third parties, including merchants, to enable them to accept or send payments from or to you using PayPal. In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number, to inform you that a payment has been sent to you or when you attempt to pay a merchant or third party. We use this information to confirm that you are a PayPal customer and that PayPal as a form of payment can be enabled, or to send you notification of payment status. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a PayPal customer with a third party, we will do so.<br> <br> Please note that merchants, sellers, and users you buy from or contract with have their own privacy policies, and although PayPal’s user agreement does not allow the other transacting party to use this information for anything other than providing PayPal Services, PayPal is not responsible for their actions, including their information protection practices.<br> <br> Regardless, we will not disclose your credit card number or bank account number to anyone you have paid or who has paid you using PayPal, or with the third parties that offer or use PayPal Services, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with credit card rules, a subpoena, or other legal process.</p> </div> <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><a class="catWidget" name="8"></a><h3>How we share personal information with other parties</h3> <div style="margin-left: 20px;"><p>We may share your personal information with:</p> <ul> <li>Members of the eBay Inc. corporate family -- like eBay, StubHub or Bill Me Later, Inc.-- to provide joint content, products, and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about their products, services, and communications. Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you have requested their services.</li> <li>Service providers under contract who help with our business operations such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, and technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.</li> <li>Financial institutions that we partner with to jointly create and offer a product (including but not limited to, the PayPal Extras credit card where we share information with GE Capital to determine whether you should receive pre-approved offers for the PayPal Extras credit card).

PayPal Access allows you to streamline and simplify the account creation and login process when using third-party websites, and it allows these websites to enhance your experience on their sites.

When you use PayPal Access, you agree that PayPal can share the information listed on the PayPal Access consent screen or in your PayPal Access account settings with the participating website. Information you allow PayPal to share with these third-party websites is subject to each third-party’s terms of service and privacy agreement, so you are encouraged to review their policies.</p> </div> <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><a class="catWidget" name="10"></a><h3>How you can access or change your personal information</h3> <div style="margin-left: 20px;"><p>You can review and edit your personal information at any time by logging in to your account and reviewing your account settings and profile.
