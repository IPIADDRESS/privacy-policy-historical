<p>Effective date:  November 20, 2004</p>
<p>PayCycle is committed to protect the security and privacy of your personal 
information. We know that information regarding you and your payroll is 
extremely important and confidential. That is why, in cooperation with TRUSTe, 
we have adopted and enforce this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>PayCycle, Inc. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because PayCycle wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, PayCycle has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, PayCycle agrees to notify you of: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>What personally identifiable information (regarding 
  you or third parties) PayCycle collects from you through our web site, and how it is used
</li><li>With whom the information may be shared, and what choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information
</li><li>What security procedures are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information under PayCycle's control
</li><li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in your 
  information.</li>        
</ul>
<p>
If you have questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, you should first contact <a href="mailto:support@paycycle.com.">support@paycycle.com</a>. You can also reach PayCycle Customer Support by telephone at (650) 852-9650 or at 210 Portage Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94306-2242. If you do 
not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been 
satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>.&nbsp; 
TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with PayCycle to resolve your concerns.  </p><h2>What Information PayCycle Collects, and How It Is Used</h2>
<p>
In order to provide PayCycle's payroll service, PayCycle's web site asks you to provide personally identifiable information about you and your employees.  This information includes your name, address, and tax identification number, and your employees' respective names, addresses and social security numbers, as well as amounts of wages and taxes that you pay.  PayCycle uses this information to prepare reports on your behalf that comply with laws applicable to employers. These reports include paystubs for your employees and tax forms for federal and state governments.  You control whether and when these reports are printed and delivered to third parties.
</p><p>
PayCycle requires that you enter a credit card number, billing name and address and expiration date.  PayCycle uses this information to verify your identity and creditworthiness.  You may also choose to have PayCycle charge its service fees to this credit card.  Alternatively, you may choose to have PayCycle debit its service fees directly to your bank account. 
</p><p>
If you elect electronic payment of your PayCycle service fees, or electronic payment of your payroll taxes, PayCycle requests additional personally identifiable information about your bank account in order to effect these transactions.  If you request direct deposit of your employees' paychecks, PayCycle requests additional personally identifiable information about your employees' bank accounts.  PayCycle will use this information to transfer payroll funds from you to your employees.  PayCycle also will use this and other information collected about you and your employees to verify your respective identities and creditworthiness.
</p><p>
PayCycle asks you to provide information about how to contact you by telephone, fax and e-mail. We will use this information to remind you when tax payments are due, to provide you with updated information about employment laws, and to service your account in other ways.  We may also use this information to contact you about additional products or services that may be of interest to you.  You will have an opportunity to "opt out" of such offers in the future, if you so choose, by following the instructions set forth in the offer that we send you.
</p><p>
 If you use our referral service to tell someone else about our service, PayCycle asks you for that person's name and e-mail  address. We will send one e-mail to that person describing our web site and service.  We will not use that person's name and e-mail address other than to inform that person about our web site and service.
</p><p>
If you sign up for our Accountant Wholesale Program, you may use PayCycle to process payroll for your clients.  Accordingly, you may enter the foregoing types of personally identifiable information on behalf of your clients who are employers and their employees.  PayCycle will use this information for the purposes of calculating paychecks and taxes and verifying identity and creditworthiness, as described above.  
</p><p>
We use a technology called "cookies" to keep track of who visits our site. A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. If you do not accept cookies from our site, you will not be able to use our site.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.
</p><p>
In addition to cookies, we collect the following information from all visitors to our site:  the name of the domain through which you access the internet; the date and time you access our site; the internet address from which you linked to our site; and the individual address of the computer you used to access our site.  We use this information in the aggregate to administer our web site, to help diagnose and trouble shoot potential server malfunctions, and to gather broad demographic information about usage of our web site.
</p><p>
</p><p></p><h2>How Information May Be Shared, and What Choices You Have</h2>
<p>
We may share personally identifiable information about you and your employees with third party vendors, such as credit card processing companies and banks, who help us perform our payroll service. We will require such third parties to use the information only as necessary to provide our payroll service to you. 
</p><p>
We may use or provide third parties with anonymous or aggregate information about our customers, such as the size of payroll processed or payment history, for statistical, marketing and other purposes.  Such aggregate or anonymous information will not reveal any of your personally identifiable information, such as your contact information, unless the third party agrees contractually to use the information exclusively on PayCycle's behalf, in ways that PayCycle itself could use the information under this Privacy Policy.  Additionally, we may provide your contact information to our business partners so that they can tell you about products, services, or offers that may benefit you. If you do not want to receive such offers, you may so indicate in the Preferences section of our web site. 
</p><p>
We may disclose personally identifiable information to the Internal Revenue Service or other government entities for normal regulatory purposes or as required by law.
</p><p>
The PayCycle web site contains links to other web sites.  Those web sites are independent of PayCycle, and PayCycle is not responsible for their privacy practices or the content.
</p><h2>Our Security Procedures</h2>
<p>
We 
take great care to design and maintain security procedures that protect your information on-line and off-line. We encrypt information that you send us and protect it with 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.  We use firewalls and intrusion-detection devices to prevent unauthorized electronic access to the servers where your information is stored, and we isolate those servers in cages to prevent unauthorized physical access.  Our employees may access your information only to help us provide you with our payroll service.  We tell all of our employees how important it is to assure that our customers' information is kept confidential and secure.
</p><p>
When you sign up for our service, you select a User Name and Password to access the PayCycle web site.  You can help protect your information by keeping your User Name and Password secret and by changing your Password from time to time.
</p><h2>How to Correct Inaccurate Information</h2>
<p>
The PayCycle website 
enables you to update and correct personally identifiable information regarding you and your employees at any time on the web site. The web site also permits you to cancel our payroll service at any time.  If you have further concerns about how PayCycle stores or uses personally identifiable information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@paycycle.com.">support@paycycle.com</a>
</p><h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
PayCycle will post any changes to this privacy policy on this page of our web site.  If we decide to use personally identifiable information in a different way from the way we described when we collected it, we will notify you and let you decide whether or not we may use your information in this different manner.  We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected, unless you give us permission to use it differently.
