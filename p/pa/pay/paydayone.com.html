    This is an expensive form of credit.  <i>RISE</i> loans are designed to help you meet your short-term borrowing needs.
    Appropriate emergencies might be a car repair, medical care for you or your family, or travel expenses in connection with your
    job.  This service is not intended to provide a solution for longer-term credit or other financial needs.  Alternative forms of credit,
    such as a credit card cash advance, personal loan, home equity line of credit, existing savings or borrowing from a friend or
    relative, may be less expensive and more suitable for your financial needs.  Refinancing may be available and is not automatic.
    Refinancing your loan will extend the term of the loan and result in additional interest charges.  Late fees and non-sufficient
    funds/returned item fees may apply as described in your Loan Agreement.  We will never charge you any "hidden fees" that are
    not fully disclosed in the Loan Agreement or the <a href="/how-online-loans-work#stateSliderhw">Loan Cost &amp; Terms</a>.  If you don’t make a payment on time we will attempt to
    contact you via one or more authorized methods. We adhere to the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). Because we
    may report your payment history to one or more credit bureaus, late or non-payment of your loan may negatively impact your
    credit rating.  If you fail to repay your loan in accordance with its terms, we may place your loan with or sell your loan to a third-
    party collection agency or other company that acquires and/or collects delinquent consumer debt.

    First time <i>RISE</i> customers typically qualify for an installment loan of $100 to $1,000 (though higher amounts may be available in certain states). 
    The APR range for loans with bi-weekly payments is 358.85% to 299.16%. For example, a $700 loan in Idaho repaid in 14 bi-weekly payments of $109.18 
    (last payment amount varies), including $828.59 of interest, has an APR of 329.07%.

    The foregoing is an example only — loan amounts, loan repayment terms and applicable finance charges vary by state and are
    governed by your loan agreement and relevant state law.  Please see <a href="/how-online-loans-work#stateSliderhw">Loan Cost &amp; Terms</a> for more details.
