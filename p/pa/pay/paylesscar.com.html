			wants you to feel comfortable about giving us access to your personal
			information. Use this Privacy Notice to find out what happens to your
			personal information when you interact with ABG and what choices you
			have. This Privacy Notice does not apply to our independent <a href="#17">licensee locations</a>. Please review the privacy notices
			of our independent licensees for information on how they use personal
			information that you provide to them. <br><br>
			This Privacy Notice	covers the personal information the ABG companies collect, use and
			disclose through your use of our products and services either online
			or offline <br><br>
			ABG needs to collect personal information from
			you to rent a vehicle or provide our other services. We collect
			personal information when you give it to us, such as by telephone,
			fax, postal mail, email, at the counter, upon completion of an
			application or enrollment form, or through your use of one of ABG's
			website or mobile Apps or the use of our products and services. <br><br>
			Sometimes,
			we may combine your personal information with other information we
			received from other sources so we can provide you a more customized
			and hassle-free experience. We may obtain personal information about
			you from a third party, such as through a travel agent, an account
			program connected with your employer or association. Additionally,
			our affiliates and third parties may provide us with information
			about you <br><br>
			We may also automatically collect technical
			information about your devices when you use our website and App. To
			learn about our online data collection, go to the <a href="#5">Online
				Data</a> section. <br><br>
			Any disputes regarding how we handle your personal information will be governed by the terms of your vehicle rental or the terms of use of our website or App, unless otherwise required by applicable law. This may include mandatory arbitration of disputes.<br>

			<strong><a id="2"></a>RENTING A VEHICLE</strong><img src="/images/icons/dot_grey.gif" width="100%" height="1"> <br>When
			you make a reservation, rent a vehicle or join one of our programs,
			we collect personal information from you, such as:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>name;</li>
			<li>email address;</li>
			<li>home and/or business address;</li>
			<li>telephone numbers at which we can reach you;</li>
			<li>date of birth;</li>
			<li>payment information such as your credit or debit card
				details (security code is obtained for transaction only - we do

				issued identification;</li>
			<li>special discount codes, partner member numbers, association
				memberships (for discounts, special privileges and points programs);
				and</li>
			<li>other information that may be required to rent you a vehicle
				and/or provide you with services.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		<br>We may also collect demographic information about you such as
		your age, gender, habits or preferences, where you rented the vehicle,
		were any special needs or equipment requested, whether you are part of
		a corporate or rewards program, where and when you returned the
		vehicle, customer service inquiries or complaints, payment
		arrangements, insurance preferences, gas consumption, mileage,
		accident history and other information related to the vehicle and your
		use of it. We use this information to administer your rental and also
		to better understand our customers and provide you with relevant
		offers.<br><br>
		Some vehicles come equipped with a global positioning
		system (GPS) or similar type tracking device that may also collect
		information about the vehicle. To learn about vehicle data we collect,
		scroll down to read about <a href="#3">Vehicle Data</a>.<br><br>
		We use all this information to provide you with our great services (for
		example, renting a vehicle and providing discounts and offers) and for
		our business purposes (research and development of new products and
		services and enforcing our legal rights).<br><br>
		One more thing:
		when you call us (from any phone), we may record or monitor the call
		for qualify control, training or similar purposes.

		<p>
			<strong><a id="3"></a>VEHICLE DATA</strong><img src="/images/icons/dot_grey.gif" width="100%" height="1"> <br>Some
			vehicles you rent from ABG may be equipped with devices which allow
			us to send commands to and receive certain information from the
			vehicle, including geolocation data from a global positioning system
			(GPS). These devices are turned on all the time, even when other
			services or other media in the vehicle is turned off. ABG and its
			partners may collect and process vehicle data about the vehicle
			itself, such as fuel level, odometer, speed, diagnostic and
			performance data, tire pressure, accident or damage data, and
			location and direction of travel data. This information assists us in
			providing our services (such as responding to unlocking door
			requests, remote start and stop and our unattended vehicle pick-up
			and return), software updates, product support, locating and
			responding to accidents, identifying reported lost, not returned,
			suspected of being stolen and stolen vehicles and as may be requested
			by law enforcement agencies. We may also use this information to
			determine certain fees to be charged in connection with our services.
			<br><br>
			This data also helps us understand vehicle or driver related
			behavior such as traffic patterns, fuel efficiency, driving behavior,
			vehicle usage, environmental impacts and vehicle maintenance
			improvement. We may share vehicle data with third parties who assist
			us in providing and improving our services and with law enforcement
			agencies and others to protect our rights or to enforce the terms and
			conditions of our services. To learn about how we share the data we
			collect, scroll down to <a href="#11">Information Sharing</a>.  <br><br>
			Services
			such as OnStar or other similar manufacturer provided features, which
			may be included in your rental, may collect vehicle data as well. We
			encourage you to go check out their privacy practices.

			<strong><a id="4"></a>PHOTOS &amp; VIDEO</strong><img src="/images/icons/dot_grey.gif" width="100%" height="1"> <br>ABG
			may collect photos and videos in some instances, such as when you
			link your ABG account with your social media profile. ABG rental
			locations are also equipped with video security surveillance systems
			as well as cameras that record as our vehicles depart/enter our lots.

		<p>
			<strong><a id="5"></a>ONLINE DATA</strong><img src="/images/icons/dot_grey.gif" width="100%" height="1"> <br>When
			you download, visit and use our websites and/or Apps, ABG
			automatically collects technical information. This section tells you
			more about what technical information we collect and why we collect
			it. <br><br>
			<i>IP Addresses</i>: We may collect your IP address
			when you visit our websites to help us diagnose problems with our
			main computers, for system administration, to report aggregated
			information to our business partners, and to audit the use of our
			website. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally
			identifiable. In select circumstances, we may use IP addresses to
			help us identify you when we feel it is necessary to enforce
			compliance with our website terms of use or to protect our service,
			site, users or others.<br> <br> 
			<i>Cookies &amp; other similar
				technologies</i>: We use cookies, scripts, pixel tags, etags, web
			beacons and other similar technologies to help us recognize you,
			remember your previous rentals, your travel preferences, etc., so you
			don't have to tell us over and over again! This helps us make the
			website more convenient and efficient. We also use these technologies
			to track website usage trends and patterns, personalize features, and
			tailor advertisements to you and provide you with a personalized
			marketing experience. We share website usage information about
			visitors with selected third parties for the purpose of targeting our
			Internet advertisements on our websites and other websites that
			display our advertisements. You can control your cookies and other
			technology preferences by going to your browser settings and tools.
			To learn more about our interest-based online marketing programs,
			read the sections below on <a href="#6">Online Advertising</a> and <a href="#12">Your Choices</a>.  <br><br> 
			<i>Mobile Analytics</i>:
			When you download and use our Avis, Budget or Payless Car Rental
			Apps, we use mobile analytics software to help us better understand
			the functionality of our App on your mobile device. Our analytics may
			record how often you use the App, how you use the App, aggregated
			usage, performance data and where you downloaded the App from. We do
			not link the analytic information to any personal information you
			submit while using the App. Scroll down to read more about how we use
			information for research under <a href="#9">Analytics</a>.<br>  <br>
			<i>Mobile GPS and Push Notifications</i>: If you let us, we may
			collect location markers using the GPS in your device or WIFI
			routers. Knowing approximately where you are helps the App provide
			you better service, such as finding the nearest Avis, Budget or
			Payless rental location near you. This also helps us send you push
			notifications or other communications based on your location (for
			example, nearby special offers) and for providing certain services
			such as arrival and return notifications, providing information about
			vehicle location, available upgrades, etc. If you change your mind
			about sharing your location or receiving push notifications from the
			App, adjust the settings of your mobile device to turn off
			transmission of geolocation data or to stop transmission of push
			notifications at any time. Just remember if you do turn these
			features off, you will not receive information tailored to your
			location or special locations-based offers.

		Social Sharing <br><br>
		ABG lets you share some ABG online content on social
		media websites through hosted sharing links and icons. You should
		remember that sharing content and links through your social media
		profile may be viewed by the public, and that you are subject to that
		social media website's privacy policy. We encourage you to read the
		privacy policies of any website you visit.  <br><br>
		ABG does not
		track or store a record of those social media comments, sharing or
		other actions. <br><br>
		If you choose to participate in posting or
		sharing activities, you should remember that it may be viewed by the
		public via ABG's website, in RSS feeds, APIs (application program
		interfaces) and may also be made available to other websites. As a
		result, your public activities may appear on third-party websites,
		blogs, or feeds. ABG isn't responsible for the information that may
