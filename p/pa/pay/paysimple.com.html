We may also create anonymous records from Personal Information for certain business purposes of PaySimple or its subsidiaries or affiliates, including but not limited to, reporting, directing future development efforts, and analyzing usage patterns so that we may enhance our Sites and Services.</li></ul><p><strong>How we share the information we collect</strong></p>
<p>Please read the “How We Share Information with Third Parties” section of this privacy policy for detailed information on how we share your Personal Information.

<p>When you access the Site, Services, or Direct Payment Services or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using cookies and other types of click-stream tracking technologies. This "automatically collected" information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique user ID, device type, device identifiers, browser types and language, referring and exit pages, platform type, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the Service, the number of clicks, the amount of time spent on pages, the dates and times that you visit the Service, and other similar information. Depending on the law of your country of residence, your IP address may legally be considered personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We typically use these cookies and similar technologies for essential and functional purposes (e.g. to maintain an active session), to improve the performance and usability of our Sites, and to analyze how users interact with the Services (e.g. to understand how long users stay on a page, how often they return, and how they arrived at our Site). On certain portions of our Sites we may collect data through these technologies for advertising, remarketing, or other similar purposes. Click-stream and related data is typically used for purposes of system administration, to improve our Services, for marketing and advertising-related purposes, and other similar uses.</p>
<h3><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong></h3>
<p>Some tracking technologies on our Services and Direct Payment Services may be provided by a third party (which may collect information on its own behalf, or may provide such information to us). We may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking).</p>
<p>The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:</p>
<ul><li>Cookies (or browser cookies). A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. Cookies can store information in different ways:<ul><li>Session cookies. A session cookie lasts while your browser is open and is automatically deleted when you close your browser.</li><li>Persistent cookies. A persistent cookie lasts until you or your browser deletes the cookies or they expire.</li></ul></li></ul><p><br>We may place "first party cookies” or “third-party cookies” on our Sites. A first party cookie is a cookie that we set on our Sites, Services, and Direct Payment Services, while a third-party cookie is set by parties other than PaySimple. A third-party cookie can recognize your computer both when it visits our Sites and when it visits other websites or applications. PaySimple does not control how third-party cookies are used. A third-party cookie may collect information on its own behalf, or may provide such information to us. You should check the third party’s website for more information about how they use cookies.</p>
<ul><li>Web Beacons. Pages of our Sites, Services, Direct Payment Services, and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email or opened a text message and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).</li></ul><ul><li>Log Files. We may collect demographic information, such as postal code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites using log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, ISP provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. This information is used to administer the Sites, Services, and Direct Payment Services and to track users' movements around the Sites, Services and Direct Payment Services, and to gather information about users and visitors in the aggregate.</li></ul><p>We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information automatically, but we may tie this information to Personal Information about you that we collect from other sources or that you provide to us. It is possible at times when collecting non-personally identifiable information through automatic means that we may unintentionally collect or receive personally identifiable information that is mixed in with the non-personally identifiable information. While we will make reasonable efforts to prevent such incidental data collection, the possibility still exists. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected your Personal Information, please notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@paysimple.com">privacy@paysimple.com</a></p>
<p>We may use analytics services that use cookies, javascript and similar technologies to help us analyze how users use the Sites, Services, and Direct Payment Services. The information generated by these services about your use of the Sites and/or Services/Direct Payment Services (including your IP address or a truncated version of your IP address) is transmitted to and stored by analytics service providers on their servers. Those service providers will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your and other users', use of the Sites, compiling reports for us on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage.</p>
<p>For example, in our email programs, PaySimple employs some tracking methods (e.g. "targeting, performance, and functionality cookies"). We track "opens" via a tracking pixel in the email- meaning we track who opens our e-mail messages and when you open our e-mail messages; and we track "clicks" via encoded URLs-meaning we track whether you click on the links contained in our e-mail messages.</p>
<p>Additionally, we use Google Analytics on our Sites and in conjunction with our Services and Direct Payment Services. Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect anonymous traffic data to help us analyze how users use the website. The information generated by a cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Sites, compiling reports on Site activity for us and providing other services relating to Site activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. By using the Sites, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>To learn more about cookies and similar tracking technologies, and how they can affect your privacy, visit <a>allaboutcookies.org</a>. To learn more about how to opt out of Google’s use of cookies, visit the Google <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/u/0/authenticated?hl=en">Ads Settings</a> page. Alternatively, you can opt out of certain pieces by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page or permanently using the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on. If you wish to take steps to opt-out of tracking by certain online advertisers, you can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a> or the Network Advertising Initiative at <a>www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>. You may control Facebook’s use of interest-based ads through your Facebook account settings, or may visit the customer support page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/247395082112892">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that because there is no consistent industry understanding of how to respond to “Do Not Track” signals, we do not alter our data collection and usage practices when we detect such a signal from your browser. Further, due to differences in international laws regarding use of cookies, when the system identifies an IP address originating from outside North America accessing a Direct Payment Services page on the *.mypaysimple.com domain it will not deploy any third-party or marketing- related cookies.</p>
<h2><strong>Third-Party Integrated Services </strong></h2>
<p>PaySimple provides the ability to integrate the Services with select third party accounting and marketing systems (“Integrated Service(s)”). When a Merchant elects to establish a PaySimple connection with an Integrated Service, all data in your account may be shared with the Integrated Service including personally identifiable information about your consumer and non-consumer customers and prospects. PaySimple does not control the policies or procedures of these Integrated Services, even though the integrations are provided through our Services, and PaySimple is not responsible for and has no control over how these third party Integrated Services function.</p>
<p>This Policy does not cover the collection or use of information, including consumer End Customer data, by Integrated Services, and Merchants acknowledge that use and access to these Integrated Services is solely at their own risk; and Merchants should consult the Terms and Privacy Policy for any Integrated Services accessed via a PaySimple account to determine how they store, process, transmit, and otherwise utilize and protect personally identifiable information and the personally identifiable information Merchants provide about their customers, prospects, and other consumers. Merchants ultimately can control which Integrated Services they choose to use with their PaySimple account, and are responsible for making sure that they do so in compliance with relevant privacy and data protection requirements.</p>
<p>PaySimple may provide the Personal Information we have collected from and/or about Merchants to Integrated Services for the purpose of enabling them to market their products or services to you, if you have not opted out of these disclosures.</p>
<h2><strong>How we Share Information with Third Parties</strong></h2>
<p>Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy or in accordance with any request or consent you provide, PaySimple does not sell, share, or in any other way transmit Personal Information (names, address, phone numbers, financial account information, Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI), etc.) submitted by non-registered users to any other persons or companies. We reserve the right, however, to use and disclose anonymous information to third parties, at our discretion. Except as limited below, third parties may use information we share with them for any purpose for which we may use such information.</p>
<p>Personal information we collect may be shared with service providers who provide certain services on our behalf, including but not limited to, identity verification, credit checks, fraud prevention, business intelligence, customer relationship management, bill collection, payment processing, marketing, hosting, and other common technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and you consent to our sharing with these parties by using our Services and/or Direct Payment Services and accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may provide information, including Personal Information of registered users to third party service providers and referral partners that work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the aspects of our services, to help us communicate with you, or to provide Merchants with ancillary services offered by such service providers and referral partners. We may also receive information about you, including Personal Information, from our third party service providers and referral partners. However, these service providers and referral partners do not have any independent right to disclose this information (except to the same extent we would have a right to disclose that information under this Privacy Policy).</p>
<p>If you make a purchase from a Merchant using our Direct Payment Services, we may grant access to or share with the Merchant any and all information we collect as part of that transaction, including credit card and other financial account information and Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI), except where that disclosure is prohibited by law, regulation or other obligations.</p>
<p>You hereby agree that we may share some or all of your Personal Information with a parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (collectively, "Affiliates"). We will require our Affiliates to comply with this Privacy Policy. If our company or some or all of our assets are acquired by another company, any personal or other information we possess may be a part of the assets transferred, and that company will possess any rights granted to us under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Finally, in extraordinary circumstances, we may share any personal or other information we possess, including but not limited to credit card and other financial account information and Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI) when necessary or appropriate to: comply with the law; cooperate with law enforcement or national security requirements; respond to lawful requests; comply with law or credit card rules; participate in a lawful federal, state or local government investigation; protect the rights of PaySimple, other PaySimple Merchants or customers, and third parties; or to investigate violations of or to enforce our <a href="https://paysimple.com/terms.html">Terms of Service</a>, <a href="https://paysimple.com/customer_terms.html">Buyer Terms</a> or <a href="https://paysimple.com/aup.html">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. However, in doing so, we may: (i) dispute demands for release to the extent we believe, in our sole discretion, are unwarranted, illegitimate or overbroad; and (ii) when we determine that it is necessary or appropriate, we will notify you of any requests for release.</p>
<p>In all cases where we share Personal Information with third parties, we will use a "minimum necessary" standard to disclose only that information required to perform the service for which the information is disclosed.</p>

<h2><strong>Rights for Residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”)</strong></h2>
<p>PaySimple only provides Services to United States based Merchants. However these Merchants may utilize our Services and deploy our Direct Payment Services such that they are collecting information from EEA residents. In such cases PaySimple is acting as a data processor and storing Personal Information on behalf of these Merchants. Thus if you are located in the EEA and utilize our Direct Payment Services, your Personal Information is processed by PaySimple and transferred to our servers and the servers of our service providers located in the United States. In order to ensure that your information is protected when transferred out of the EEA, PaySimple relies on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield (described in more detail above), as well as inter-company agreements between our various third party service providers that may process your information on behalf of PaySimple, Inc.</p>
<p>If you are located in the EEA, you have certain rights under European law with respect to your personal data, including the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete, port to another service provider, or object to certain uses of your personal data.

<p>If you are a Merchant using or a Visitor to PaySimple Sites and/or Services and wish to exercise these rights, please reach out to us using the contact information below. If you are a customer or End Customer of a Merchant who uses PaySimple’s platform and wish to exercise these rights, please contact the Merchants you interacted with directly -- we serve as a processor on their behalf, and can only forward your request to them to allow them to respond.</p>
<p>If you are unhappy with the response that you receive from us we hope that you would contact us to resolve the issue but you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection authority in your jurisdiction at any time.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you are located in the EEA, note that we are generally processing your information on behalf of a Merchant in order to fulfill contracts they might have with you (for example if you make an order through the Direct Payment Services), unless we are required by law to obtain your consent for a particular processing operation. In particular we process your personal data to pursue the following legitimate interests, either for ourselves, our merchants, or other third parties (including our merchants’ customers):</p>
<ul><li>To provide Merchants, End Customers and others with our services and applications;</li><li>To prevent risk and fraud on our platform;</li><li>To provide communications on behalf of Merchants;</li><li>To provide reporting and analytics;</li><li>To help Merchants find and integrate with Integrate Services;</li><li>To provide troubleshooting, support services, or to answer questions;</li><li>To test out features or additional services; and</li><li>To improve our services, applications, and websites.</li></ul><p>When we process Personal Information to pursue these legitimate interests, we do so where we believe the nature of the processing, the information being processed, and the technical and organizational measures employed to protect that information can help mitigate the risks to the data subject. However, though we undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you provide to us, PaySimple cannot be responsible for ensuring the security, accuracy, or privacy of your data once it leaves our environments (as directed by Merchants utilizing the Services).</p>
