                    <strong>HOW YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE USED</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The personal information that you submit to us remains your property, but by submitting such information to us you grant us the right, subject to applicable state and federal law, to use the personal information (other than credit card information) for marketing purposes.                </p>
                <p>You agree that we may contact you at any time with updates and/or any other information that we may deem appropriate for you to receive in connection with your continued use of the Website and any and all offerings made available therein, or otherwise by Firestarter Systems.                </p>
                <p>
                    We also use contact information from your personal information to send you information about us, our products and services and to contact you about your billing account status. If you wish to stop receiving future communications from us, please see the Opt-Out/Unsubscribe section below.                </p>
                <p>
                    You agree that by submitting your personal information to Firestarter Systems, you agree to receive e-mail marketing from Firestarter Systems and our third-party advertisers. In addition, you agree that such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR §310 et seq. (the “ATSR”). With respect to the ATSR, and notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the terms of the ATSR.
                </p>
                <p>
                In addition, by submitting your personal information to Firestarter Systems, you agree to receive mobile marketing including, but not limited to, text-message based marketing, from us  (where, and to the extent that, such marketing is permitted by applicable law). As such, notwithstanding that your mobile telephone number may be listed on state and/or federal Do-Not-Call registries, we retain the right to contact you via text-message based marketing in accordance with applicable state and federal law. </p>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to release current or past personal information: (a) in the event that we believe that the Website, and any products, services or other offerings is/are being or has/have been used in violation of this Privacy Policy, the Firestarter Systems Terms of Use, Firestarter Systems Purchase Agreement, or to commit unlawful acts; (b) if the information is subpoenaed; or (c) if any entity comprising Firestarter Systems is sold or acquired. Moreover, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or communication to any third-party when we, in our sole discretion, determine the disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third-parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time. Visitors should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to permit personally identifiable information to be shared or transferred to third parties without permission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may also supplement the information we collect with information from other sources to assist us in evaluating and improving the Website, our products and/or services, and to determine your preferences so that we can tailor the Website and our products and/or services to your needs.

                <p>
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not use your credit card information for any marketing purposes, or transfer same to any third party, other than as set forth in this paragraph. Firestarter Systems may: (a) transfer your credit card information to third party sellers where necessary to effectuate the purchase of products and/or services that you requested on the Website or otherwise from Firestarter Systems; (b) disclose your credit card information pursuant to a court order, litigation and/or fraud investigation; and (c) share with third parties the fact that we have credit card information on file for specific individuals.

                    <strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS OR WEBSITE ADVERTISERS</strong>
                </p>

                    The Website may contain third party provided banners, pop-ups, hyperlinked advertising and links to other third-party owned and/or operated websites. Firestarter Systems is not responsible for the privacy practices associated with such third party advertisers and/or websites. In some cases, you may be required to provide certain information to register or complete a transaction via such advertisers and/or at such websites. These third-party websites and advertisers have separate privacy and data collection practices and Firestarter Systems has no responsibility or liability relating to them. We do not endorse, nor are we responsible for the accuracy of, the privacy policies and/or terms and conditions of such advertisers and/or websites. These third party entities are independent third parties and are not affiliated with us.

                <p>
                    To stop receiving future e-mail communications from Firestarter Systems, please notify us by email at Support@firestartersystems.com. Firestarter Systems may maintain separate e-mail lists for different purposes. If e-mail recipients wish to end their e-mail subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each e-mail message to unsubscribe from the particular list.

                    <strong>DATA SECURITY</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    All collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure environment. When our registration/application process asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), and when we store and transmit such sensitive information, it is encrypted and protected with SSL encryption software. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect sensitive information and other personal information off-line. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet, or otherwise, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your sensitive information and other personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. Access to this personal information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. All of our users’ personal information, not just sensitive information, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personal information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all Firestarter Systems user personal information. Employees not adhering to our written firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable federal and
                    state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your personal information. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.
