<p class="stylep"><strong>3rd Party Disclosure</strong> - This statement informs the customer of what information you plan on disclosing to 3rd parties.  In most cases this statement applies to partner companies that you work closely with in order to process or deliver various products to your clients.</p>
<p class="stylep">Here's a sample statement that you can either use as-is or edit to fit your current policy.</p>
<p class="stylep">Customer information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without the consent of the customer, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or service requested by the customer.</p>
<p class="stylep">--------------------</p>
<p class="stylep"><strong>Private Information Security</strong> - This statement addresses what you do with a customer's private information after an order is placed.  Note: Private information is different than public information.  Private information refers to information like credit card numbers, social security numbers, financial statements, etc., which must be securely stored and managed if you plan on storing it on your own server.  If you're like most businesses, the only private information gathered from the customer is credit card information, which is typically stored on your payment gateway provider's secure servers on your behalf (IE. Companies like Authorize.net, Linkpoint, Paypal, 2CheckOut, etc.).</p>
<p class="stylep">Basically you have two options.  If you don't store credit cards or other private information on your server (which is most likely the case), then you'll want to add something similar to option a) below.  On the other hand, if you do store credit cards or other private information on your own server (which is rare), you'll need to go with something similar to option b) and provide more detailed information.  Feel free to use the sample statements below:</p>
<p class="stylep">a) For your safety and protection, your credit card information is not stored on our servers.  Our payment gateway provider, (insert providers name/s here), keeps this information encrypted and secure on your behalf.</p>
<p class="stylep">--or--</p>
<p class="stylep">b) Private customer information (credit cards, S.S. Numbers, financial's, etc.) may be stored on our servers, in order to......  (Please make sure to enter 1) the reason why the private information needs to be stored on your server, 2) how long you plan on storing this information, and 3) how you protect this information while it is being stored.)</p>
<p class="stylep">Remember, customers need to know how their information is going to be kept secure and what measures you take to secure it, so the more information you can provide the better.  Also, if you are storing private information, particularly credit card numbers on your own server, you should look into PCI scanning services.</p>
<p class="stylep">--------------------</p>
<p class="stylep"><strong>Email Usage</strong> - This statement refers to the issue of email notifications.   If you plan on sending email specifically related to a customers order or a product that a customer has ordered, or if you plan on sending occasional email updates, you typically don't need to provide an opt-in / opt-out option.   However, if you have a mailing list, or plan on sending your customers regular or ongoing emails that are not directly related to a product or service that they have purchased from you, you need to include an opt-in area where they physically subscribe and agree to receive email from you, and you need to include an opt-out / unsubscribe option or have instructions as to how they can unsubscribe in the emails you send.  Below are some different sample statements that you can use.  Please select the option that best fits your websites needs:</p>
<p class="stylep">a) The email address you provide for order processing, will only be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your order.</p>
<p class="stylep">b) The email address you provide for order processing, may be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your order, in addition to periodic company news, updates, and/or related product or service information, etc.</p>
<p class="style2">--and if you have an opt-in or mailing list option, please add the following option in addition to one of the options above--</p>
<p class="style1"><span class="stylep">c) If you decide to opt-in to our mailing list, you will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, promotions, etc. However, you may opt-out at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:mikefilsaimesupport@gmail.com">mikefilsaimesupport@gmail.com</a></span></p>

<p style="text-autospace: none;  "><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">How We collect and store information depends on the page You are visiting, the activities in which You elect to participate and the services provided. For example, You may be asked to provide information when You register for access to certain portions of Our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when You make a purchase. You may provide information when You participate in any of Our programs, on or through The Website(s) and other interactive areas of The Website(s). Like most websites, We also collect information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to You. For example, We may log the name of Your Internet Service Provider or Your IP address, or use information available through the Internet, cookie technology, other forms of technology, and technologies yet to be conceived and/or implemented, to recognize You and hold information from Your visit.&nbsp; (To learn more about "IP addresses" or "cookies", find information by use of an Internet search engine.)&nbsp; As We adopt additional technology, We may also gather additional types and categories of information about You and Your use of The Website(s), its Services, Your use of the the Internet, and/or Your implied topics of interest, usage, or research, and do this through other means.</span></p>

  </span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">We may collect basic user profile information from all of Our Visitors. We collect the following additional information from Our Authorized Customers: the name, address, phone number and email address, the nature and size of the business, and the nature and size of the advertising inventory that the Authorized Customer intends to purchase or sell.<br>
  <b><br>
  What organizations are collecting the information? <br>
  </b>In addition to Our direct collection of information, Our third party service vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses and banks) who may provide such services as credit card processing, insurance, and escrow services may collect this information from Our Visitors and Authorized Customers. We do not control how these third parties use such information, but We do ask them to disclose how they use Personally Identifiable Information provided to them from Visitors and Authorized Customers. Some of these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as links in the distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use the information given to them.<br>
  <b><br>
  How do We use Personally Identifiable Information?<br>
  </b>We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize The Website, to make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling requests on The Website. We may email Visitors and Authorized Customers for research purposes or about purchase and selling opportunities on The Website or information related to the subject matter of the The Website. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorized Customers in response to specific inquiries or to provide requested information. </span></p>

Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of The Website(s) (Our Web hosting service or server rental company, for example), in general, may have indirect access to such information. We will use Your information only as permitted by law and as describes in this Privacy Policy.

We review these requests and when, in Our judgment, We think the information would be of benefit to You, We may cooperate in getting You this information. We view receiving such information as a benefit for those who are seeking new tools to help them run their online business.&nbsp; In such cases, We would provide You with this information directly, rather than provide Your Personally Identifiable Information to the outside companies and professional associations. We may initiate the communication of any information or advertising for Our direct or indirect financial gain and it is done so without any compensation due to You or any other recipient of the information.</span></p>

We respect Your privacy and do not share Your information with anyone outside of Our organizations (see definition of "We", "Our", and "Us", above) and any subsidiaries We may have. Additionally, real time transmission of the information may occur to affect, enable, or enhance other programs and services.</span></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;  "><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Aggregate Information (information that does not personally identify You) may be used in many ways.

We do not have complete control over the actions or intentions of the third party payment processors or how they use the information that You may provide during a payment transaction and therefore have no responsibility for their use of the data specific to the transaction. These payment processors, and/or Your own financial institution may, in some circumstances, make secondary use of Your personal information and purchasing history; it is Your responsibility to contact the payment processors and/or Your financial institution for information regarding their specific usage of the information conveyed during transactions.</span></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;  "><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">On most purchases and transactions through or from The Website(s), We will normally collect and record merchant/payment processing information. Much of the determination on what information is collected and/or archived before, during, and/or after a purchase transaction, is based on the provisions and/or limitations of the payment processor systems that are implemented on The Website(s), and this may vary from site to site. Purchases will normally be done via third party merchant transaction or other payment providers and such information during the post sale transaction of data and the data communication between their computer(s) and Our computer(s) may or may not not be encrypted or protected with SSL or any other form of encryption software, in some cases.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none;  "><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The actual account access credentials information is not supplied to Us, but is available only for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction. The account and/or credentialization information is only disclosed to specific third parties as necessary to complete the purchase transaction, or during the process of financing the transaction. Additionally, notifications delivered in the form of email to Us will be delivered unencrypted and clearly readable in standard character sets defined by or within the geography of delivery or by or within the receiving computer's configuration. During the entire process of placing and paying for an order, there may be several steps in the process where data is transmitted unencrypted and this may vary from one step to another, or by the payment method and/or payment or merchant transaction processor chosen or available at the time of purchase, or by any third party provider used by the merchant transaction or associated payment processor, all of which is beyond Our control. Your payment processor ID and password, payment processor transaction identifiers, dates and times of transactions, contractual obligations or details specific to the transactions, electronic forms of signature, and any other information used when identifying or explaining or replicating the transaction may be stored temporarily or permanently on The Website(s).</span></p>
