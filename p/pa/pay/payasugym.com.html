Please make sure that you have read these terms and conditions before completing your transaction with us. Where we act as a Disclosed Agent, this will mean that we have no contractual liability to you in respect of that product. However, we may still be liable to you if we have been negligent, we have misrepresented important information or have been in breach of any other relevant law. On the other hand, for other Partners, we act as Principal. This means that the contract for the product is between you and us. We will always let you know where we act as Principal and where we act as a Disclosed Agent. When is a purchase made? A purchase is made at the point an ePass is either redeemed or expires. At this point a receipt of purchase will be available. For an expired ePass Sandcroft Avenue will always be acting as Principal.</p>

<p>
	In addition to the information which you may volunteer to us, certain Customer Information is automatically collected when you visit the payasUgym website via tracking technologies employed by us from time to time such as cookies, flash cookies, web bugs, javascript. These collect Customer Information including technical information from your computer whenever you visit the website such as your Internet protocol (IP) address, your operating system and platform, browser type and version and referrer website as well as providing us with information about your shopping preferences, viewed/searched-for products and on site activity. The information collected by cookies and other tracking methods placed by us is anonymous and does not contain your Personal Information but will simply identify you as a specific number by reference to your hard drive. If you are a wireless user and gain Internet access via a mobile phone you should contact your wireless provider to find out if they collect Personal Information about you.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>
	Each website owned and operated by payasUgym uses cookies (small text files containing a unique identification number). Types of cookies:</p>
<p>
	<strong>Session cookies</strong></p>
<p>
	Used to maintain something called session state. Session cookies are required for the website to function but are not used in any way to identify you personally.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Permanent cookies</strong></p>
<p>
	When you visit our website, we will assign a permanent cookie on the hard drive of your computer. You can view these by looking in the cookies directory of your browser installation. As the name implies, permanent cookies last for a long time and each time you visit our website you send us a copy of them allowing us to identify you from visit to visit. For instance, if you were looking at gyms in London last time you were on the website and the next time you visit us we have a great gym promotion, this cookie enables us to recognise you, so that we can show you that deal. The aim is to enhance your experience whilst on the website and make sure you don’t miss out on great offers. Cookies do not contain any Personal Information for example, your name, address, email address, or telephone number, but simply a unique identification number that identifies your computer to us.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Third party tracking devices</strong></p>
<p>
	We will carry advertising relating to third parties on our website. This advertising is served either directly by third party advertisers or on their behalf by advertising network companies.

They may aggregate information about your visits to our website and other websites retrieved via such cookies with other information that you may have provided directly to the relevant advertiser or ad network. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies and other tracking devices by third parties. This will be covered by that third party’s privacy policies and practice and we would recommend that you take a look at these which in most cases will be found on that company’s website.</p>

<p>
	<strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TERMS OF USE FOR AN eWALLET</strong></p>
<p>
	Sandcroft Avenue Ltd stored value is exempt from the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 because funds can only be used to buy a limited range of services from <a href="http://www.payasugym.com/">www.payasUgym.com</a>. The funds in your eWallet can only be used to purchase goods from payasUgym. The funds in your eWallet cannot be used to purchase any goods directly from the gyms or facilities listed on payasUgym. The minimum amount you can ‘top-up’ onto your eWallet is £3. Your eWallet funds cannot exceed a maximum of £100. You are only able to withdraw funds to credit or debit card already used to ‘top-up’ funds into your eWallet. A £1 administration fee is charged to withdraw funds from your eWallet. This £1 is charged to cover the bank charges and administration expenses that we incur from this transaction. If a period of 24 months passes with no orders placed, we will assume that your account is no longer active and your eWallet balance will expire.</p>
<p>
	<strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TERMS OF USE FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF ePASS</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>General Terms</strong></p>
<p>
	An ePass is a unique alpha numeric code purchased by you and only applies to and is valid to be redeemed at the selected gym Partner for entrance to their facilities.</p>
<p>
	<strong>1-day Gym ePass &amp; 1-day Swim ePass</strong></p>
<p>
	An ePass is valid for one single entrance the gym it was purchased for and can be used within a period of 30 days. If an ePass is not used within the 30 days the ePass will be invalid and you will lose the value, this ePass will be marked ‘Expired’ in the ‘My Account’ section. At any point whilst an ePass is valid you are able to refund the ePass and the price of the ePass minus a £1; charge will be returned to your eWallet. The £1; charge covers the transactional and administration cost that payasUgym incurred to issue the ePass. We do not want our customers to lose the value of any ePass and therefore we will e-mail you and let you know when an ePass is about to expire.</p>
<p>
	<strong>30-day, 90-day Gym and other ePasses longer than 1-day</strong></p>
<p>
	An ePass purchased for periods longer than 1-day can used multiple times within the ePass validity period. For example a 30-day ePass can be used multiple times within the 30-day period. The ePass code will remain the same for the duration of the validity period. All ePasses purchased for periods longer than 1-day are non-refundable.</p>
<p>
	<strong>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINIMUM AGE TO PURCHASE AN ePASS</strong></p>
<p>
	You have to be aged 18 years or above to purchase an ePass. However some of our Partners allow parents and other legal guardians to purchase ePasses to be used at Partner gyms for children under 18 in their care. This is most likely to be the case for Local Leisure Centre facilities where swimming ePasses are available. As it is entirely under the discretion of the gym you are advised to check with the Partner that you intend to visit if you would like to purchase an ePass for children less than 18 years of age.</p>
<p>
	<strong>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONTACTING PAYASUGYM</strong></p>
