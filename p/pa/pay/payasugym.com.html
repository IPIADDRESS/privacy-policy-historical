Please make sure that you have read these terms and conditions before completing your transaction with us. Where we act as a Disclosed Agent, this will mean that we have no contractual liability to you in respect of that product. However, we may still be liable to you if we have been negligent, we have misrepresented important information or have been in breach of any other relevant law. On the other hand, for other Partners, we act as Principal. This means that the contract for the product is between you and us. We will always let you know where we act as Principal and where we act as a Disclosed Agent. When is a purchase made? A purchase is made at the point a Pass is either redeemed or expires. At this point a receipt of purchase will be available. For an expired Pass Sandcroft Avenue will always be acting as Principal.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>
	Each website owned and operated by payasUgym uses cookies (small text files containing a unique identification number). Types of cookies:</p>
<p>

For instance, if you were looking at gyms in London last time you were on the website and the next time you visit us we have a great gym promotion, this cookie enables us to recognise you, so that we can show you that deal. The aim is to enhance your experience whilst on the website and make sure you don’t miss out on great offers. Cookies do not contain any Personal Information for example, your name, address, email address, or telephone number, but simply a unique identification number that identifies your computer to us.</p>

This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies and other tracking devices by third parties.

	<strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TERMS OF USE FOR AN eWALLET</strong></p>
<p>
	Sandcroft Avenue Ltd stored value is exempt from the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 because funds can only be used to buy a limited range of services from <a href="http://www.payasugym.com/">www.payasUgym.com</a>. The funds in your Account can only be used to purchase goods from payasUgym. The funds in your Account cannot be used to purchase any goods directly from the gyms or facilities listed on payasUgym. The minimum amount you can ‘top-up’ onto your Account is £3. Your Account funds cannot exceed a maximum of £100. You are only able to withdraw funds to credit or debit card already used to ‘top-up’ funds into your Account. A £1 administration fee is charged to withdraw funds from your Account. This £1 is charged to cover the bank charges and administration expenses that we incur from this transaction. If a period of 24 months passes with no orders placed, we will assume that your account is no longer active and your Account balance will expire.</p>
<p>
	<strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TERMS OF USE FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF ePASS</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>General Terms</strong></p>
<p>
	A Pass is a unique alpha numeric code purchased by you and only applies to and is valid to be redeemed at the selected gym Partner for entrance to their facilities.</p>
<p><strong>1-day Gym Pass &amp; 1-day Swim Pass &amp; 1-day Sessions</strong></p>
<p>A Pass is valid for one single entrance the gym it was  purchased for and can be used within a period of 30 days. If a Pass is not used  within the 30 days the Pass will be invalid and you will lose the value, this  Pass will be marked ‘Expired’ in the ‘My Account’ section. At any point whilst  a Pass is valid you are able to refund the Pass and the price of the Pass minus  a £1; charge will be returned to your Account. The £1; charge covers the  transactional and administration cost that payasUgym incurred to issue the  Pass. We do not want our customers to lose the value of any Pass and therefore  we will e-mail you and let you know when a Pass is about to expire.</p>
A 1-day pass purchases with bonus credit can be  refunded however the bonus credit will only be credited back into the account  if it is valid and has not expired during the period while the pass was not  used. All 1-day passes purchased with a First Pass Free promotion can be  cancelled but not funds will be transferred back into the registered user’s  account.
<p><strong>30-day, 90-day Gym and other Passes longer than 1-day</strong></p>
<p>
	A Pass purchased for periods longer than 1-day can used  multiple times within the Pass validity period. For example a 30-day Pass can  be used multiple times within the 30-day period. The Pass code will remain the  same for the duration of the validity period. All Passes purchased for periods  longer than 1-day are non-refundable.</p>
<p><strong>Bundle Passes</strong></p>
<p>Bundle products are multiple single use passes which are  sold at a discounted price than the corresponding individual pass. All bundle  products are non-refundable.</p>
<p><strong>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINIMUM AGE TO PURCHASE AN ePASS</strong></p>
<p>
	You have to be aged 18 years or above to purchase a Pass. However some of our Partners allow parents and other legal guardians to purchase Passes to be used at Partner gyms for children under 18 in their care. This is most likely to be the case for Local Leisure Centre facilities where swimming Passes are available. As it is entirely under the discretion of the gym you are advised to check with the Partner that you intend to visit if you would like to purchase a Pass for children less than 18 years of age.</p>
