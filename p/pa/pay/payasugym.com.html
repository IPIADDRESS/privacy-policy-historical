In most cases this will mean that there are additional terms and conditions governing the contract as each supplier will have terms and conditions relating to that product. Please make sure that you have read these terms and conditions before completing your transaction with us. Where we act as a disclosed agent this will mean that we have no contractual liability to you in respect of that product.

However some of our Partners allow parents and other legal guardians may purchase ePasses to be used at Partner gyms for children under 18 in their care. This is most likely to be the case for Local Leisure Centre facilities where swimming is available under the ePass. As it is entirely under the discretion of the gym you are advised to check with the Partner that you intend to visit if you would like to purchase an ePass for children less than 18 years of age.</p>
