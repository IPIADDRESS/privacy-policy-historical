	<strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>
	Each website owned and operated by payasUgym uses cookies (small text files containing a unique identification number). Types of cookies:</p>
<p>

For instance, if you were looking at gyms in London last time you were on the website and the next time you visit us we have a great gym promotion, this cookie enables us to recognise you, so that we can show you that deal. The aim is to enhance your experience whilst on the website and make sure you don’t miss out on great offers. Cookies do not contain any Personal Information for example, your name, address, email address, or telephone number, but simply a unique identification number that identifies your computer to us.</p>

<p>
	Sandcroft Avenue Ltd is certified as a Small Electronic Money Issuer by the Financial Services Authority. The minimum amount you can ‘top-up’ onto you eWallet is £3. Your eWallet funds cannot exceed maximum £100. You are only able to withdraw funds to credit or debit card already used to ‘top-up’ funds into your eWallet. A £1 administration fee is charged to withdraw funds from your eWallet. This £1 is charged to cover the bank charges and administration expenses that we incur from this transaction. If a period of 24 months passes with no orders placed, we will assume that your account is no longer active and your eWallet balance will expire.</p>

<p>
	<strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>TERMS OF USE FOR AN ePASS</strong></p>
<p>
	An ePass is only applies to and is valid to be redeemed at the selected gym Partner. An ePass is valid for a period of 30 days. If an ePass is not used within the 30 days the ePass will be invalid and you will lose the value, this ePass will be marked ‘Expired’ in the ‘my account’ section. At any point whilst an ePass is valid you are able to refund the ePass and the price of the ePass minus a £1; charge will be returned to your eWallet. The £1; charge covers the transactional and administration cost that payasUgym incurred to issue the ePass. We do not want our customers to lose the value of any ePass and therefore we will e-mail you and let you know when an ePass is about to expire.</p>
<p>

	<strong>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>MINIMUM AGE TO PURCHASE AN ePASS</strong></p>
<p>
	You have to be aged 18 years or above to purchase an ePass. However some of our Partners allow parents and other legal guardians may purchase ePasses to be used at Partner gyms for children under 18 in their care. This is most likely to be the case for Local Leisure Centre facilities where swimming is available under the ePass. As it is entirely under the discretion of the gym you are advised to check with the Partner that you intend to visit if you would like to purchase an ePass for children less than 18 years of age.</p>
<p>
