This site is owned and operated by Superfreaker Studios, LLC . At Superfreaker
Studios, LLC, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.<br>
              <br>
Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should
fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of
that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather
and how we use it.<br>
              <br>
INFORMATION Superfreaker Studios, LLC GATHERS AND TRACKS<br>
Superfreaker Studios, LLC gathers two types of information about users:<br>
· Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions.
These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate
in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in
polls and surveys:<br>
· Information Superfreaker Studios, LLC gathers through aggregated tracking
information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This
information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help
our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience.
Because Superfreaker Studios, LLC derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships
and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping
our service in operation. <br>
              <br>
Superfreaker Studios, LLC Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:<br>
Optional Voluntary Information<br>
We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission
of personal information by users:<br>
              <br>
1. Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)<br>
We will offer a electronic newsletter to users. Superfreaker Studios, LLC gathers
the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves
from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that
points users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe to
the newsletters at the time of registration.<br>
              <br>
2. Message boards/forums<br>
Users of the site’s Message Boards and Forums must register separately for
these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages, although
they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is required
to supply a username, password, and email address.<br>
              <br>
3. “E-mail this to a friend" Service<br>
Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents
to someone else by clicking “e-mail this to a friend”. The user must
provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information
is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient
know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.<br>
              <br>
4. Polling<br>
We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions
with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions
or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular
user. Superfreaker Studios, LLC may use a system to "tag" users after
they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag
is not correlated with information about individual users.<br>
              <br>
5. Surveys<br>
Superfreaker Studios, LLC may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target
our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information
in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. <br>
Children<br>
Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998
(COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information
from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.<br>
Usage tracking<br>
Superfreaker Studios, LLC tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our
sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual
users. Superfreaker Studios, LLC does break down overall usage statistics according
to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information
from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).<br>
Superfreaker Studios, LLC sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that
users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with
individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our
sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track
what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This
helps us continue to build a better service for you.<br>
Cookies<br>
We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of
your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although
it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have
specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie
can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off
your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Superfreaker Studios,
LLC uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising
system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.<br>
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your
browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message
with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site.
However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums,
polling and surveys.<br>
              <br>
USE OF INFORMATION<br>
Superfreaker Studios, LLC uses any information voluntarily given by our users
to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive
or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based
on the interests of our users.<br>
As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to
send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls,
surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers on
a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special
editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something
we are doing. When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our
sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track
what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This
helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered
in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we
don't track which terms a particular user enters.<br>
Superfreaker Studios, LLC creates aggregate reports on user demographics and
traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers
to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements
that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns
of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific
user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual
user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect
the personal safety of our users or the public.<br>
              <br>
SHARING OF THE INFORMATION<br>
Superfreaker Studios, LLC uses the above-described information to tailor our
content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's
demographics.<br>
              <br>
SECURITY<br>
Superfreaker Studios, LLC operates secure data networks protected by industry
standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies
are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals
have access to the information provided by our customers.<br>
              <br>
OPT-OUT POLICY<br>
We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:<br>
· Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely
alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information from our
users <br>
              <br>
YOUR CONSENT  <br>

by Superfreaker Studios, LLC. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will
