              This site is owned and operated by Superfreaker Studios, LLC . At Superfreaker Studios, LLC, we want to make your experience online satisfying and 
              safe.<br>
              <br>
              Because we gather certain types of information about our users, 
              we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding 
              the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement 
              discloses what information we gather and how we use it.<br>
              <br>
              INFORMATION Superfreaker Studios, LLC GATHERS AND TRACKS<br>
              Superfreaker Studios, LLC gathers two types of information about users:<br>
              · Information that users provide through optional, voluntary 
              submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic 
              newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to 
              email a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys:<br>
              · Information Superfreaker Studios, LLC gathers through aggregated 
              tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout 
              our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content 
              to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better 
              understand the demographics of our audience. Because Superfreaker Studios, LLC derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, 
              providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping 
              our service in operation. <br>
              <br>
              Superfreaker Studios, LLC Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:<br>
              Optional Voluntary Information<br>
              We offer the following free services, which require some type of 
              voluntary submission of personal information by users:<br>
              <br>
              1. Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)<br>
              We will offer a electronic newsletter to users. Superfreaker Studios, LLC 
              gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. 
              Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following 
              the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription 
              management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at 
              the time of registration.<br>
              <br>
              2. Message boards/forums<br>
              Users of the site’s Message Boards and Forums must register 
              separately for these services (both are free of charge) in order 
              to post messages, although they needn't register to visit the site. 
              During registration the user is required to supply a username, password, 
              and email address.<br>
              <br>
              3. “E-mail this to a friend" Service<br>
              Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, 
              or documents to someone else by clicking “e-mail this to a 
              friend”. The user must provide their email address, as well 
              as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case 
              of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know 
              who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.<br>
              <br>
              4. Polling<br>
              We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share 
              their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks 
              about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are 
              aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. Superfreaker Studios, LLC may use a system to "tag" users after they have 
              voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This 
              tag is not correlated with information about individual users.<br>
              <br>
              5. Surveys<br>
              Superfreaker Studios, LLC may occasionally conduct user surveys to better 
              target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated 
              demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers 
              and partners. <br>
              Children<br>
              Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection 
              Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally 
              identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without 
              requesting parental consent.<br>
              Usage tracking<br>
              Superfreaker Studios, LLC tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of 
              our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data 
              about individual users. Superfreaker Studios, LLC does break down overall 
              usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, 
              and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string 
              (information contained in every user's browser).<br>
              Superfreaker Studios, LLC sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms 
              that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never 
              associated with individual users. We use tracking information to 
              determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based 
              on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users 
              read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps 
              us continue to build a better service for you.<br>
              Cookies<br>
              We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser 
              files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal 
              Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this 
              site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. 
              But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information 
              you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk 
              or read cookie files created by other sites. Superfreaker Studios, LLC uses 
              cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our 
              advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad 
              impressions and click rates.<br>
              You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've 
              set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will 
              receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to 
              have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies 
              to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling and surveys.<br>
              <br>
              USE OF INFORMATION<br>
              Superfreaker Studios, LLC uses any information voluntarily given by our users 
              to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to 
              provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to 
              better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.<br>
              As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide 
              in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users 
              to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We 
              send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending 
              on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when 
              we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something 
              we are doing. When we use tracking information to determine which 
              areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to 
              those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather 
              how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build 
              a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search 
              function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But 
              we don't track which terms a particular user enters.<br>
              Superfreaker Studios, LLC creates aggregate reports on user demographics 
              and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This 
              allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows 
              our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their 
              needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, 
              an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked 
              their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual 
              user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process 
              or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.<br>
              <br>
              SHARING OF THE INFORMATION<br>
              Superfreaker Studios, LLC uses the above-described information to tailor 
              our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand 
              our audience's demographics.<br>
              <br>
              SECURITY<br>
              Superfreaker Studios, LLC operates secure data networks protected by industry 
              standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security 
              and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary 
              and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided 
              by our customers.<br>
              <br>
              OPT-OUT POLICY<br>
              We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices 
              include:<br>
              · Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, 
              which completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable 
              information from our users <br>

              By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this
