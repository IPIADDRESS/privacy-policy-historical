<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Welcome to the privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") for PayDayFinders.co.uk 
based in London, United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. 
Please read this Privacy Policy to learn about ways in which we use and protect 
your personal information. </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies from 28th October 
2008 for new registering users.</p>
<p>The following policy explains how we gather and use personal information in 
detail. This policy may change from time to time and PayDayFinders.co.uk 
reserves the right to change or modify this policy at any time with or without 
notice. If you have any questions about this policy, please feel free to contact 
us. </p>
<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>PayDayFinders.co.uk only collects 
personally identifiable information ("PII") that is volunteered during the 
registration process or in response to specific information requests. Examples 
of PII that may be requested include: first and last name, address, email 
address, and telephone number. Anybody completing and submitting any of the 
forms (including our newsletter) on the PayDayFinders.co.uk domain is considered 
a "registrant." In addition, PayDayFinders.co.uk may collect your IP address and 
information through use of electronic "cookies." </p>

<p>By using this Site, you agree that you will be registered with 
PayDayFinders.co.uk, and that you accept this Privacy Policy. You will not be 
registered merely by visiting the Site; you will only be registered if you 
affirmatively click on one of the Site's options to directly match you with a 
loan or provide other services. Also, by providing us with your personal 
information on our Site or in the course of using our services, you consent to 
the transfer of your Personal Data and Sensitive Personal Data, and any other 
data we acquire about you from third-party service providers in the process of 
evaluating you for a loan, to companies outside the EU, including but not 
limited to, the Network Sites and other consumer credit lenders and their 
affiliates.&nbsp; </p><p>When you register with PayDayFinders.co.uk you 
automatically consent to registration in all the other online properties in the 
PayDayFinders.co.uk network (collectively, the "Network Sites"). Accordingly, 
PayDayFinders.co.uk may share registrant PII with the Network Sites. </p>

<h2>Use and Sharing of PII</h2>
<p>PayDayFinders.co.uk 
reserves the right to use registrant PII: (1) for the specific purpose for which 
such information was provided (including matching registrants with a cash 
advance loan company or companies); (2) as disclosed at the time such 
information is provided; and (3) as disclosed in this Policy. However, please 
note that PayDayFinders.co.uk may change this Policy at any time and therefore 
PayDayFinders.co.uk may in the future use registrant PII for additional purposes 
not currently included in this Policy. </p>
<h2>Use of Individual Information</h2>
<p>The 
following paragraph describes how PayDayFinders.co.uk currently uses Individual 
Information, but PayDayFinders.co.uk may change or broaden its use at any 
time.&nbsp; PayDayFinders.co.uk may update this policy from time to time. 
PayDayFinders.co.uk may use Individual Information to provide promotional offers 
to individuals by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail 
marketing, online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible 
uses.</p>

<h2>Email and Unsubscribe Policy</h2>

<p>PayDayFinders.co.uk 
uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers by email to 
individuals. Promotional offers include third party marketing messages as well 
as email advertising from partners and affiliates of PayDayFinders.co.uk. 
PayDayFinders.co.uk may maintain separate email lists for different 
purposes.&nbsp; If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a 
particular list and/or to unsubscribe from all PayDayFinders.co.uk's email list, 
they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to 
unsubscribe. </p>

<p>PayDayFinders.co.uk's unsubscribe process impacts only the 
future delivery of electronic mailings disseminated by PayDayFinders.co.uk's on 
its own behalf.&nbsp; You may still receive electronic mailings sent on behalf 
of Third Parties and your personal information may still be shared with Third 
Parties for use in offline marketing and data appends, including email 
appends.</p>

<p>You should also note that unsubscribing from PayDayFinders.co.uk's 
electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe the subscriber's 
information from any Third Party business associates and licensees of the 
data.&nbsp; Since Third Party associates and licensee partners maintain separate 
databases from PayDayFinders.co.uk, and you will need to unsubscribe from each 
source individually, if desired.&nbsp; This allows you the freedom to pick and 
choose which subscriptions to maintain and which to discontinue.</p>

<h2>Content of Email Messages</h2>
<p>In certain commercial 
email messages sent by PayDayFinders.co.uk, an Advertiser's name will appear in 
the "From:" line but hitting the "Reply" button will cause a reply email to be 
sent to PayDayFinders.co.uk.&nbsp; The "Subject:" line of Company email messages 
will usually contain a line provided from the Advertiser to PayDayFinders.co.uk 
or from PayDayFinders.co.uk in its own promotions.</p>

<h2>Solicited Email</h2>

<p>PayDayFinders.co.uk only sends 
email to individuals who have agreed on the Websites to receive email from 
PayDayFinders.co.uk or to individuals who have agreed on a Third Party website 
to receive email from Third Parties.&nbsp; As such, PayDayFinders.co.uk does not 
send unsolicited email messages.&nbsp; As a result, The United Kingdom's 
statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email may not be 
applicable to Company's email messages.</p>

<h2>Fraud Prevention</h2>

<p>If false or inaccurate 
information is provided, including in relation to a person's identity and fraud 
is identified, details about this information, including customer Personal Data, 
will be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may also 
access and use this information. We and other organizations may also access and 
use this information to prevent fraud.</p>

<p><strong>If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you 
should not use this Site.</strong></p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions, concerns, or comments 
about this Privacy Policy, you can write to us at <a href="mailto:info@PayDayFinders.co.uk">info@PayDayFinders.co.uk</a>.</p>
