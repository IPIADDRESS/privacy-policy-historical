<p>The following policy explains how we gather and use personal  information in detail. This policy may change from time to time and  PayDayFinders reserves the right to change or modify this policy at any  time with or without notice. If you have any questions about this  policy, please feel free to contact us.<br>
  <br>
By using this Site, you agree that you will be registered with  PayDayFinders, and that you accept this Privacy Policy. You will not be  registered merely by visiting the Site; you will only be registered if  you affirmatively click on one of the Site's options to directly match  you with a loan or provide other services. Also, by providing us with  your personal information on our Site or in the course of using our  services, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Data and  Sensitive Personal Data, and any other data we acquire about you from  third-party service providers in the process of evaluating you for a  loan, to companies outside the EU, including but not limited to, the  Network Sites and other consumer credit lenders and their affiliates.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should not  use this Site. If you have already registered and wish to terminate  your registration, follow the instructions in "Opting-Out of Further  Communications," below.<br>
<br>
Registration:<br>
PayDayFinders only collects personally identifiable information ("PII")  that is volunteered during the registration process or in response to  specific information requests. Examples of PII that may be requested  include: first and last name, address, email address, and telephone  number. Anybody completing and submitting any of the forms (including  our newsletter) on the PayDayFinders domain is considered a  "registrant." In addition, PayDayFinders may collect your IP address  and information through use of electronic "cookies."<br>
<br>
When you register with PayDayFinders you automatically consent to  registration in all the other online properties in the PayDayFinders  network (collectively, the "Network Sites"). Accordingly, PayDayFinders  may share registrant PII with the Network Sites.<br>
<br>
Use and Sharing of PII<br>
PayDayFinders reserves the right to use registrant PII: (1) for the  specific purpose for which such information was provided (including  matching registrants with a cash advance loan company or companies);  (2) as disclosed at the time such information is provided; and (3) as  disclosed in this Policy. However, please note that PayDayFinders may  change this Policy at any time and therefore PayDayFinders may in the  future use registrant PII for additional purposes not currently  included in this Policy.<br>
<br>
Also, PayDayFinders may share registrant PII with its partners,  sponsors, advertisers, unaffiliated third-party consumer credit  lenders, service providers and marketers' lookup and reference services  and any other entities that PayDayFinders believes are able to provide  registrants with special offers and opportunities. Note that although  PayDayFinders advises, PayDayFinders has no control over such party's  information handling practices and is not responsible for any failure  of such party to adhere to this Policy.<br>
<br>
As a condition of registration, registrants agree that PayDayFinders  may share their PII with the Network Sites and unaffiliated third  parties. If you do not agree that PayDayFinders may share your PII with  such entities, you may not register on PayDayFinders, and if you are  already registered, you must immediately terminate your account, by  following the instructions in "Opting-Out of Further Communications."<br>
<br>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit  our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your  name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to  this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods  and services of interest to you. If you would like more information  about this practice and to know your choices about not having this  information used by these companies, click here.<br>
<br>
We may use personal information to provide the services you've  requested, including wireless services that display customized content  and advertising. In addition to any fee of which you are notified, your  provider's standard messaging rates apply to our confirmation and all  subsequent SMS correspondence. You may opt-out and remove your SMS  information by sending "STOP", "END", "QUIT" to the SMS text message  you have received. If you remove your SMS information from our database  it will no longer be used by us for secondary purposes, disclosed to  third parties, or used by us or third parties to send promotional  correspondence to you.<br>
<br>
Additionally, PayDayFinders may share Registrant PII in aggregate,  non-personal form, with select companies that wish to reach a  particular target audience. This information will allow these entities  to provide relevant offers to specific registrants.<br>
<br>
Finally, PayDayFinders may disclose registrant PII in order to: (1)  comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries; (3)  comply with valid legal process; and (4) protect the rights or property  of PayDayFinders, the Network Sites or other registrants of this Site.<br>
<br>
Do Not Call Registry Compliance:<br>
By submitting personal contact and/or financial information through  PayDayFinders, the user hereby grants written permission to  PayDayFinders, its affiliated sites, and its business partners for  contact via telephone, mail, and/or e-mail. Further, by registering at  PayDayFinders you are consenting to receive phone calls from  PayDayFinders, its affiliated sites, and its business partners for  contact via telephone, including but not limited to lenders that may  contact you regarding a loan and thereby registrants waive their right  to file a claim with the FTC or any other agency in reference to these  calls or contacts.<br>
<br>
Third Party Offers:<br>
By registering at PayDayFinders you may receive follow-up  contacts/offers from third party companies. We cannot be responsible  for the services or representations of third party advertisers.<br>
<br>

<br>
Security, Fraud, and Abuse:<br>

<br>
Opting-Out of Further Communications:<br>
PayDayFinders registrants may opt-out of receiving further  communications from PayDayFinders. Registrants may, at any time, choose  not to receive promotional emails from PayDayFinders or the Network by  following the "unsubscribe" instructions in any PayDayFinders e-mail  received by registrant.<br>
<br>
Note that unsubscribing from one email list does not automatically  unsubscribe you from any other email list that you may be on. Please  read the email carefully to find out which list you are unsubscribing  from.<br>
<br>
Must Be 18 Years or Older:<br>
PayDayFinders or its Network is neither intended for, nor directed to,  children under the age of 18. If PayDayFinders learns that a person who  registers on the Site is under the age of 18, PayDayFinders will  promptly delete that individual's registration.<br>
<br>
Transfer In Certain Circumstances:<br>
In its sole discretion, PayDayFinders may transfer, sell or assign  information collected on and through this Site, including without  limitation, PII and other registrant-provided information, to one or  more third parties, as a result of the sale, merger, consolidation,  change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or  liquidation of PayDayFinders and/or Network Sites.<br>
<br>
Change in Policy:<br>
PayDayFinders may, from time to time, amend this Policy, in whole or  part, in its sole discretion. Depending on the nature of the change,  PayDayFinders will either announce the change (1) on the privacy policy  page of the site, or (2) provide such notice via e-mail to registrants.  By not unsubscribing, following the announcement of any changes, you  will be deemed to have agreed to such changes. If you do not agree with  the terms of this Policy, as it may be amended from time to time, in  whole or part, you must terminate your registration by unsubscribing.</p>
