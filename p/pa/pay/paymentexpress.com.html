<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
  Direct Payment Solutions (hereinafter referred to as DPS) is committed  to protecting your privacy as an internet user whenever you buy goods  or services from a supplier who uses the DPS payment facilities. Your  supplier will generally be using our facilities in connection with  payment by you using a credit card over the internet. We recognize our  responsibility to keep confidential at all times any information about  you which we acquire in connection with such a transaction, whether  directly from yourself or through the supplier. We protect your  personal information on the Internet to an equivalent high standard to  that of which you would experience through any channels of the bank,  such as bank branches, cash machines or on the telephone. Please note  however that our responsibility is necessarily limited to protection by  us of information which we obtain. We cannot, of course, ourselves  control the use or disclosure by your supplier of any information which  they obtain from you. </p>
<p><strong>Collection of Information:</strong><br>
  To enable us to provide secure  payment facilities we will typically acquire information which may  include your name, your credit card numbers (with the expiry date) and  your billing address.</p>
<p><strong>Use and disclosure of Information:</strong><br>
  We use the information  which you enter onto the payment page to obtain authorization to the  transaction from the issuer of the credit card and our own or the  supplier's bank and to process the payment. Some details from your  transaction (such as your name and email and delivery address, but  never your card details) are made available to the supplier through our  customer management system, which allows them to keep track of what  transactions have been made. Subject to the above, DPS will not  disclose the information to third parties, or make any use of it,  without your permission (unless we are required to do so by statute or  by an authorized body in order to aid the investigation or prevention  of crime).</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong><br>
  DPS is committed to protecting the security of  your data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to  help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or  disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide  in computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled  facilities secured by the latest in surveillance and security  technology. When we transmit sensitive information (such as a credit  card numbers) over the internet, we protect it through the use of  encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Credit card  details stored on site are encrypted using 168bit 3DES encryption. DPS  is also certified AIS compliant: </p>
<p> <em>"Direct Payment Solutions has successfully completed the Visa  Account Information Security (AIS) validation process to demonstrate  compliance with the Visa Global AIS program. The AIS program defines  security standards and industry best practices to protect sensitive  data such as credit card account information and other transaction and  personal details. Adherence to these standards will minimize the  possibility of data compromise."</em> </p>
