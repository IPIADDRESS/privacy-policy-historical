<h2>DPS Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p><b>Introduction:</b><br>
Direct Payment Solutions (hereinafter referred to as DPS) is committed to protecting your privacy as an internet user whenever you buy goods or services from a supplier who uses the DPS payment facilities. Your supplier will generally be using our facilities in connection with payment by you using a credit card over the internet. We recognize our responsibility to keep confidential at all times any information about you which we acquire in connection with such a transaction, whether directly from yourself or through the supplier. We protect your personal information on the Internet to an equivalent high standard to that of which you would experience through any channels of the bank, such as bank branches, cash machines or on the telephone. Please note however that our responsibility is necessarily limited to protection by us of information which we obtain. We cannot, of course, ourselves control the use or disclosure by your supplier of any information which they obtain from you.
</p>
<p><b>Collection of Information:</b><br>
To enable us to provide secure payment facilities we will typically acquire information which may include your name, your credit card numbers (with the expiry date) and your billing address.</p>
                 
<p><b>Use and disclosure of Information:</b><br>We use the information which you enter onto the payment page to obtain authorization to the transaction from the issuer of the credit card and our own or the supplier's bank and to process the payment. Some details from your transaction (such as your name and email and delivery address, but never your card details) are made available to the supplier through our customer management system, which allows them to keep track of what transactions have been made. Subject to the above, DPS will not disclose the information to third parties, or make any use of it, without your permission (unless we are required to do so by statute or by an authorized body in order to aid the investigation or prevention of crime).</p>
<p><b>Security:</b><br>DPS is committed to protecting the security of your data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide in computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities secured by the latest in surveillance and security technology. When we transmit sensitive information (such as a credit card numbers) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Credit card details stored on site are encrypted using 168bit 3DES encryption. DPS is also certified AIS compliant:
