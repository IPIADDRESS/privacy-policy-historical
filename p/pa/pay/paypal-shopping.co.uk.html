Overview</h3> <p>In order to operate the PayPal Services and to reduce the risk of fraud, PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. ("PayPal", “our”, “us” or "we"), the data controller, must ask you to provide us with information about yourself, including your credit or debit card and/or bank account details. By consenting to, and agreeing the terms of, this Privacy Policy, you expressly consent and agree to us processing your data in the manner set out herein. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect and how we use that information. PayPal takes the processing of your personal information very seriously and will use your information only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p> <p>We will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. However, in order for us to offer our services to our users; enhance the quality of our service from time to time; and protect the interests of our users, we will in limited circumstances share some of your personal information with third parties under strict restrictions, as described in more detail in the section "Our Use and Disclosure of Information". It is important for you to review this Privacy Policy as it applies to all the PayPal Services.</p> <p><strong>By accepting the Privacy Policy at registration, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information and direct us to do so in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</strong></p> <p>All future changes to this Privacy Policy set out in the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/upcoming-policies-full">Policy Update</a> &nbsp;already published on the “Legal Agreements” landing page of the PayPal website at the time you register for the Services are incorporated by reference into this Privacy Policy and will take effect as specified in the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/upcoming-policies-full">Policy Update</a>. <strong>“Policy Update”</strong> means a prior notice of changes to any of your agreements with PayPal which PayPal may make available to you in writing. If you disagree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not register for or use the PayPal Services.</p> <p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong></p> <p>This Privacy Policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the PayPal Services or as we incorporate suggestions from our customers. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a revised version on our website. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it. In addition, if we propose to change this Privacy Policy in a substantial manner, we will provide you with at least 30 days' prior notice of such a change. We may post the notice on the "Policy Updates" page of our website(s) and/or send the notice by e-mail. After this 30 days' notice, you will be considered as having expressly consented to all amendments to the Privacy Policy. If you disagree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, you may close your account at any time.</p> <p>Please check the PayPal website at <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/">https://www.paypal.com/uk/</a> at&nbsp;any time for the most current version of our Privacy Policy.</p> <p>Some pages on the PayPal website include links to third-party websites. These sites are governed by their own privacy statements, and PayPal is not responsible for their operations, including but not limited to their information practices. Users submitting information to or through these third-party websites should review the privacy statements of these sites before providing them with personally identifiable information.</p> <p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Policy does not constitute a "framework contract" for the purpose of the EU Payment Services Directive (2007/64/EC) or any implementation of that directive in the European Union or EEA (including, without limitation, the UK Payment Services Regulations 2009).</p> <p><strong>A Special Note about Children</strong></p> <p>Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors (persons under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us or use the PayPal Services.<br> </p> <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p> <a class="catWidget" name="2"></a> <h3>2. Binding Corporate Rules</h3> <p>In addition to the privacy practices set out in this Privacy Policy, eBay Inc., the ultimate parent company of PayPal, has established a set of Corporate Rules (also referred to as Binding Corporate Rules), approved by a number of European Union data protection regulators. These Corporate Rules are a commitment by eBay Inc. to adequately protect your personal information regardless of where the data resides, and depending upon your location, may provide additional rights through your data protection regulator or a court. If you would like additional information regarding our Corporate Rules please <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/ewf/f=ci_prv">contact us</a>.</p> <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <a class="catWidget" name="3"></a> <h3>3. Information We Collect</h3> <p><strong>Required Information</strong></p> <p>To open a PayPal account or use the PayPal Services, you must provide your name, address, phone number, and email address. In order to make payments through the PayPal Services, you must provide credit card, debit card or bank account information. We also ask you to choose two different security questions to answer (such as your city of birth or your pet's name). This required information is necessary for us to process transactions, issue a new password if you forget or lose your existing password, protect you against credit card fraud and current account fraud, and contact you should the need arise in administering your account or the PayPal Services.</p> <p>We will also require other commercial and/or identification information if you send or receive certain high-value transactions or high overall payment volumes through the PayPal Services or as is otherwise required in order for us to comply with our anti-money laundering obligations under European law.</p> <p>When you access PayPal using a mobile device (e.g. a smartphone), we may additionally collect and store device sign-on data (including device ID) and geolocation data in order to provide our services.</p> <p>If you use certain functionalities provided by us (such as the PayPal POS Functionality available in your mobile app) we may ask you to upload a picture of you in order to provide these specific services. If we allow you to link your membership of an eligible loyalty scheme to your Account, we may require you to provide to us your loyalty scheme membership ID.</p> <p><strong>Transaction Information</strong></p> <p>When you use the PayPal Services to send money to someone else or request money from someone else, we ask you to provide information related to that transaction. This information includes the amount and type of the transaction (purchase of goods, purchase of services, or simple money transfer), other purchase details and the email address, Skype ID (if applicable) or phone number of the third party. Also, when you send money to another PayPal customer, you may be asked to provide personal details to that customer to complete the transaction. Those details may also be passed on to us from that customer. We retain this information for each of your transactions through the PayPal Services and may add this information to your account profile to be used for future transactions that you may make with us. We also collect the Internet address (IP address) and other identifying information about the computer or device you use to access your PayPal account or use the PayPal Services, in order to help detect possible instances of unauthorised transactions.</p> <p><strong>Information about You from Third Parties</strong></p> <p>In order to protect all our customers against potential fraud, we verify the information you provide with the "Payment Processors" and/or "Credit Reference and Fraud Agencies" listed in the table under the section "Disclosure to Third Parties other than PayPal Customers" below. In the course of such verification, we receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you register a credit card or debit card or bank account with PayPal, we will use card authorisation and fraud screening services to verify that your bank or card information and address match the information you supplied to PayPal, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.</p> <p>If you send or receive high overall payment volumes through the PayPal Services, or if as a merchant have limited selling history, in some circumstances we will conduct a background check on your business by obtaining information about you and your business, and potentially (if legally permitted) also about your directors, shareholders and partners, from a credit reference or fraud agency such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet, as listed in the table under the section entitled, "Disclosure to Third Parties other than PayPal Customers" below. If you owe us money, we may conduct a credit check on you by obtaining additional information about you from a credit reference or fraud agency, to the extent permitted by law. PayPal, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to periodically retrieve and review a business and/or consumer credit report supplied by such credit reference or fraud agency for any account, and reserves the right to close an account based on information obtained during this credit review process.<br> <br> If you use your PayPal account to sell items, we may also collect public information about your business and your behaviour on social media platforms (such as the e-mail address and the number of “likes” and “followers”), to the extent relevant to confirm an assessment of your transactions and/or your business, including its size and the size of its customer base.<br> <br> We may also collect information from members of the eBay Inc. corporate family or other companies (subject to their privacy policies). If you are sending transaction related communication on PayPal’s or eBay’s conflict resolution platforms to your buyer or seller, we may collect such information in order to assess your transactions and any risk associated with your activities, as well as for fraud detection, prevention, and or remediation of fraud, or other illegal actions or to detect, prevent or remediate violations of policies or the applicable user agreements.</p> <p><strong>Additional Verification</strong></p> <p>If we cannot verify the information that you provide, or if you request a withdrawal by cheque to an address other than your verified credit card billing address, we may ask you to upload or send us additional information by fax (such as your driving licence, credit card statement, and/or a recent utility bill, or other information linking you to the applicable address), or to answer additional questions online to help verify your information.</p> <p><strong>Website Traffic Information</strong></p> <p>Because of the way Internet communication standards work, when you arrive at or leave the PayPal website, we automatically receive the web address of the site that you came from or are going to. We also collect information on which pages of our website you visit, IP addresses, the type of browser you use and the times you access our website. We use this information to try to understand our customers' preferences better and to manage the load on our servers, so as to improve our services and your experience with PayPal.</p> <p><strong>Our Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, Local Storage and Similar Technologies</strong></p> <p>When you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, tools, advertising, and messaging (such as email), we or our authorised service providers may use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies for storing information to help provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience. This page is designed to help you understand more about these technologies and our use of them on our sites and in our services, applications, and tools.</p> <p>Below is a summary of few key things you should know about our policy related to the use of such technologies.

Although this information is stored for a certain period of time, we will not market to the non-registered person in any way at any time. Additionally, these persons have the same rights to access and correct information about themselves (assuming that their details were correct) as anyone else who uses the PayPal Services.</p> <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <a class="catWidget" name="4"></a> <h3>4.

Further, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, you waive your moral rights and promise not to assert such rights against the eBay Group, its sublicensees or assignees. You represent and warrant that none of the following infringe any intellectual property right: your provision of content to us, your posting of content using the PayPal Services, and the eBay Group’s use of such content (including of works derived from it) in connection with the PayPal Services.</p> <p><strong>Marketing</strong></p> <p>We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalise the PayPal Services. If you don't wish to receive marketing communications from us or participate in our ad-customisation programmes, simply log in to your account, select My Account, Profile, then My account settings and update your Communication preferences, or follow the directions provided with the communication or advertisement.</p> <p><strong>Disclosure to Other PayPal Customers</strong></p> <p>If you are a registered PayPal user, your name, email address, Skype ID (if applicable), phone number (if applicable) date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received from verified PayPal users, and whether you have been verified to have control of a bank account are made available to other PayPal customers whom you have paid or senders who are attempting to pay you using the PayPal Services. If you are a Business account holder, we will also display to other PayPal customers the website address (URL) and customer service contact information that you provide us. In addition, this and other information may also be shared with third parties when you use these third parties to access the PayPal Services. However, your credit card number, bank account and other financial information will not be revealed to anyone whom you have paid or who has paid you through the PayPal Services or third parties that use the PayPal Services, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so pursuant to credit card rules, a court order or other legal process.</p> <p>If you are buying goods or services and pay through PayPal, we may provide the seller with the delivery address for the goods and your billing address to complete your transaction. If an attempt to pay your seller fails, or is later invalidated, we may also provide your seller with details of the unsuccessful payment. To facilitate dispute resolutions, we may provide a buyer with the seller's address so that goods can be returned to the seller.</p> <p>If you are using the PayPal POS Functionality on your mobile app, we may share your picture that you have stored with your mobile app with the seller with whom you are attempting to transact in order to verify your identity, as well as the fact that that you are within local reach as a customer.</p> <p>If you use PayPal as means of logging into external websites or mobile apps, we may share your login status with any third party offering this Service as a login method, as well as the personal and other Account information that you consent to being shared so that the third party can recognise you. PayPal will not give such third party access to your PayPal Account and will only make payments from your Account to that third party with your specific authorisation. You can access, view and control the settings for any such data sharing with merchants when logged into your PayPal account.</p> <p>If you link your membership of an eligible loyalty scheme to your Account in our mobile app, we may share your loyalty scheme membership ID with any merchant participating in the relevant loyalty scheme when you pay that merchant using PayPal. If you remove your loyalty scheme membership ID from your Account, we will stop sharing this information.</p> <p>We work with third parties including merchants to enable them to accept or facilitate payments from or to you using the PayPal Services. In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us such as your email address or phone number, when a payment is sent to you or when you are attempting to pay that third party. We use this information to confirm that you are a PayPal customer and that PayPal can be enabled to make a payment, or where a payment is sent to you to send you a notification that you have received a payment. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a PayPal customer with a third party, we will do so. Please note that third parties you buy from and contract with may have their own privacy policies, and PayPal is not responsible for their operations, including but not limited to their information practices.</p> <p>By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree and consent that each time you pay or attempt to pay another PayPal customer(including a merchant) using your PayPal account, PayPal may transfer the aforementioned relevant data to such PayPal customer, who may be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), in order to process, execute or otherwise deal with and provide information about the payment. You also expressly agree and consent to PayPal providing transactional information and other information necessary for the use of a PayPal mobile application (including point of sale products) to a merchant or another PayPal customer who you have explicitly selected or chosen using the PayPal mobile application or point of sale product.<br> <br> If you open a PayPal account directly on a third- party website or via a third party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly through the PayPal Services) will be shared with the owner of such third party website or application and your information may be subject to their privacy policies.</p> <p><strong>Disclosure to Third Parties other than PayPal Customers</strong></p> <p>PayPal will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent, and will only disclose this information in the limited circumstances and for the purposes described in this policy. This includes transfers of data to non-EEA member states.

If false or inaccurate information is provided by you and fraud is identified, details will be passed by us to fraud prevention agencies and law enforcement agencies may access and use that information.

You can choose whether to receive some, all or none of these communications when you complete the registration process, or at any time thereafter, by logging in to your account on the PayPal website, selecting My Account, Profile, then My account settings, and updating your Communication preferences.</p> <p>We may communicate with you as described above by SMS (and SMS will be treated as an email for the purpose of managing your Communication preferences).</p> <p>In connection with independent audits of our financial statements and operations, the auditors may seek to contact a sample of our customers to confirm that our records are accurate.

Information Security</h3> <p>PayPal is committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information security. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorise access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfil their job responsibilities.</p> <p>For more information on PayPal's security practices, please see our <a href="http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_security-center-outside">Safety Advice</a>.</p> <p>The security of your PayPal account also relies on your protection of your PayPal password. You may not share your PayPal password with anyone. PayPal representatives will never ask you for your password, so any email or other communication requesting your password should be treated as unauthorised and suspicious and forwarded to <a href="mailto:spoof@paypal.com">spoof@paypal.com</a>. If you do share your PayPal password with a third party for any reason, including because the third party has promised to provide you additional services such as account aggregation, the third party will have access to your account and your personal information, and you may be responsible for actions taken using your password. If you believe someone else has obtained access to your password, please change it immediately by logging in to your account and changing your Profile settings, and also <a href="https://www.paypal.com/ewf/f=ci_prv">contact us</a> right away.<br> </p> <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <a class="catWidget" name="6"></a> <h3>6.

You can also close your account through the PayPal website. If you close your PayPal account, we will mark your account in our database as "Closed", but will keep your account information in our database. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account. However, if you close your account, your personally identifiable information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, or as required by law.</p> <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <a class="catWidget" name="7"></a> <h3>7.

IMPORTANT DATA PROTECTION INFORMATION FOR USERS RECEIVING PAYMENTS THROUGH WEBSITE PAYMENTS PRO (INCLUDING VIRTUAL TERMINAL) AND/OR PAYPAL HERE*</strong></h3> <p>* PayPal Here is PayPal POS Functionality within the PayPal Mobile App (as defined in our User Agreement) that enables a User to pay another User (typically a merchant) or anybody to make a direct card payment to that merchant, in each case for goods and services at a physical point of sale (for example, in store).&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>A GUIDE TO THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BY PAYPAL (EUROPE) S.À.R.L. ET CIE, S.C.A. AND CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES <br> <br></strong> <strong>SECTION 1: GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR USE OF CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES</strong></p> <p><strong>Q: What is a credit reference agency?</strong></p> <p>A: Credit reference agencies (CRAs) collect and maintain information on consumers' and businesses' credit behaviour, on behalf of financial institutions and lenders in the UK.</p> <p><strong>Q: Why do you use them when I have applied to your organisation?</strong></p> <p>A: Although you have applied to us, PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. and we will check our own records, we may also contact CRAs to get information on your, your financial and/or business associates’ and your business’ credit behaviour with other organisations. This will help us make the best possible assessment of your overall situation before we make a decision.</p> <p><strong>Q: Where do they get the information?</strong></p> <p>A: From publicly available sources, including:</p> <p>- electoral registers maintained by local authorities;<br> - County Court Judgments records operated by Registry Trust Limited;<br> - bankruptcy information held by the Insolvency Service; and<br> -&nbsp;fraud information from fraud prevention agencies.&nbsp;</p> <p>Credit information also comes from information on applications to banks, building societies, credit card companies etc and also from the conduct of those accounts.</p> <p><strong>Q: How will I know if my information is to be sent to a CRA or fraud prevention agency?</strong></p> <p>A: Organisations are only allowed to send information to CRAs and/or fraud prevention agencies with your agreement and knowledge. You will be told when you apply for Website Payments Pro or PayPal Here if your data will be supplied. The next section of this document will tell you how, when and why we search information at CRAs and what we do with the information we obtain from them. We will also tell you if we plan to send information on you or your business, if you have one, to CRAs.</p> <p><strong>Q: Why is my data used in this way?</strong></p> <p>A: We and other organisations want to make the best possible decisions we can, in order to make sure that you, or your business, will be able to carry out your obligations to us. We and other organisations may also use the information to check your identity. In this way we can ensure that we all make responsible decisions. At the same time we also want to make decisions quickly and easily and, by using up-to-date information, provided electronically, we are able to make the most reliable and fair decisions possible.</p> <p><strong>Q: Who controls what credit reference agencies are allowed to do with my data?</strong></p> <p>A: All organisations that collect and process personal data are regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998, overseen by the Office of the Information Commissioner. All credit reference agencies are in regular dialogue with the Commissioner. Use of the Electoral Register is controlled under the Representation of the People Act 2000.</p> <p><strong>Q: Can just anyone look at my data held at credit reference agencies?</strong></p> <p>A: No, access to your information is very strictly controlled and only those that are entitled to do so may see it. Usually that will only be with your agreement or (very occasionally) if there is a legal requirement.</p> <p><strong>SECTION 2: WHAT PAYPAL (EUROPE) S.À.R.L.&nbsp;ET CIE, S.C.A.
