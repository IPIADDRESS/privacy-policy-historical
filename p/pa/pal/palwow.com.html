<p>Palwow ("Palwow" or "we") operates Palwow.com. This Privacy Policy describes palwow’s use and sharing of personally identifiable information ("PII"-- your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, or credit card number) that members<font size="2">&nbsp;voluntarily provide to palwow when they register (also known as "Registration PII"). The Term "User" refers to a&nbsp;vistor</font><font color="#ff0000" size="2"><font color="#ff0000" size="2"> </font></font><font size="2">or a Member. This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by palwow, including any palwow-branded URL (the "palwow Website"), the palwow instant messaging service, the palwow application developer service and other features (for example, music and video embedded players), palwow mobile services, and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by palwow in connection with the palwow Website (collectively, the "palwow Services"). The palwow Services are hosted in the United States.</font><font face="Times New Roman"></font></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The palwow Website is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>General. When palwow collects PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting Registration PII to us in order to register as a Member of palwow. Palwow may also collect PII from you if you choose to participate in palwow Services activities like mobile recharges, sweepstakes, contests, and surveys, because you want us to furnish you with products, mobile recharge, services, newsletters, or information, or in connection with content or suggestions you submit to palwow for review. </p>
<p>　</p>
<p>In addition, palwow collects other non-PII including IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type. This data is used to manage and improve the palwow Services, track usage, and for security purposes. </p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Palwow Members may also choose to provide or store non-PII information in their profiles, including but not limited to date of birth, interests, hobbies, lifestyle choices, groups with whom they are affiliated (schools, companies), videos and/or pictures, private messages, bulletins or personal statements (collectively "Profile Information"). The Profile Information in a Member’s profile is provided at his or her sole discretion.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Palwow Members can change their Registration PII and Profile Information at any time and can control how Visitors, other Members and palwow communicate with them by controlling their account settings, available within the "Edit Profile" portion of their Palwow profile.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Palwow Services may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Palwow Services may also carry advertisements from other companies. Palwow is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or other services operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the palwow Services or for the privacy practices of third party Internet advertising companies. Once you leave palwow Services via such a link, access a third party application (such as widgets) or click on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine, among other things, how they will handle any PII they collect from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Some of the advertisements that appear on palwow Services may also be delivered to you by third party Internet advertising companies. These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect non-PII about your visit to or use of palwow Services, including information about the ads they display, via a cookie placed on your computer that reads your IP address. To opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Palwow will only use the PII you provide under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If palwow obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is also governed by this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>　</p>
<p>In order to locate other palwow Members that you may already know in the physical world, palwow allows Users to search for Members using Registration PII (i.e., full name or email address). palwow also allows Users to browse for certain Profile Information in order to help connect with Members (i.e., schools and/or companies where Users may have attended or worked).</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Palwow may customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on the palwow Website, or may work with outside companies to do so. Your non-PII and/or Profile Information may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. </p>
<p>　</p>
<p>There may be instances when palwow may access or disclose PII, Profile Information or non-PII without providing you a choice in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of palwow, our Affiliated Companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of Users of the palwow Services or members of the public including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if palwow sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of all or a material part of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, Palwow may transfer your PII to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>When a Member who is located in the European Union or any other country chooses to post Profile Information that will be publicly disclosed, that Member is responsible for ensuring that such information conforms to all local data protection laws. Palwow is not responsible under the EU local data protection laws for Member-posted information.</p></td>

On May 27th, 2011, the leaders of Palwow and SMA Alliance agreed to terms which will change the community of Palwow.com and the immediate brick and mortar community of each member in a very positive way. <br>
Mission- We endeavor to transform Palwow.com, built with a solid foundation of its members and change the framework of the community to focus on&nbsp; providing a free place where employers can quickly find support for their growing organizations and members of every community can freely and quickly find employment or pass along great opportunities to friends and family, as they come through the palwow.com platform. It will be built similar to linkedin, Palwow will offer a simplified platform which can be improved to enrich the lives of each person within their communities through increased opportunities which automatically reach qualified persons of each field of employment. <br>
For example: Even if a member is happily employed as an accountant, odds are that they probably know another accountant who would be a better fit. An accounting firm would simply drop an ad looking for an accountant and it would go to everyone listed as an accountant, student of accounting and related fields.&nbsp; This will save each community millions of dollars and weeks of time in finding the right fit.<br>
Money- While we must spend some time working on the new platform and integrating our powerful software into Palwow.com, we hope to be up and running in 90 days or less. We must guard our revenue model and exact business model to protect against competitive forces however we can tell you now that there shall be rewards for every participating community member. Every time a job is placed through the Palwow platform, the member who, through networking helps connect the employer to employee, would be rewarded monetarily and perhaps you could take your newly employed friend to a dinner and a coffee to celebrate their employment.<br>
Proof- To further assure the level of our intentions it is important to note that SMA Alliance is publicly traded (OTC: SMAAD) and has proven extremely successful, operating with EBITDA of 40%, and has Positive Net Earnings per Share of .058 cents and a book value of .35 cents per share. <br>
This endeavor is projected to increase company revenues significantly within the first 18 months and SMA intends to share in those revenues with members.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
~SMA Alliance and Palwow.com Administration<br>
