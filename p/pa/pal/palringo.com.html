                Personal Information: In addition to email and phone details,
                after you register you have the option to provide us with
                personal information which may include (but may not necessarily
                be limited to) your gender, age group, country, your
                likes/dislikes and other personal preferences. We use this
                information to deliver the service and communicate with you
                effectively and to learn about our customer base through
                abstract statistics (e.g. percentage of female users aged

                information is important as it allows us to monitor the

                <p>
            We take many precautions to keep your personal information secure
            from unauthorized access, such as encrypted storage of personal
            information on our servers and internal corporate policies to limit
            access to systems that store your personal information. In addition,
            we keep the most sensitive information, such as your Personal
            Attributes/Interests, encrypted so it can only be accessed when
            authorised. We will periodically destroy old personal information
            when it is no longer required or as required by law. 
        </p>
                <p>
            When using our service you can choose who you share your information
            with, for example through making your information only available in
            a private group. However, when using the Internet no security
            measures can be guaranteed at all times. We have no control over
            others to whom you make your information available. We cannot
            guarantee that your information will not be viewed by unauthorised
            persons. If you remove information it may still remain available to
            others who have previously had access to it and who may have copied
            it.
        </p>
                <p>
            You also need to be aware that your information may become available
            in the third party search engines results (Google, Yahoo, Ask for
            example). This should not ordinarily happen to information that is
            published by you in a private group but any information published in
            a public group may become generally available. We cannot and do not
            guarantee that third party search engine "crawlers" and "spiders"
            will not access and make publicly available your information,
            particularly if posted in a public group. You should also be aware
            that if information is published in a private group and the
            administrator of that private group changes the profile to a public
            group then all information previously posted in the private group
            will become generally available for anyone to see.
