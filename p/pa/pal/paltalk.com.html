                                If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend&rsquo;s name and email address.

                            <p><strong><u>Uses of Information</u></strong><br>Paltalk's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on Paltalk and through our partners. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements and encourage your participation. By knowing a little about you, Paltalk is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.</p>
                            <p>In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, Paltalk plays the middleman. Advertisers give us advertisements and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). Paltalk displays the advertisement to users meeting the specified criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual user information. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional email through Paltalk and its affiliates.</p>
                            <strong><u>Personally identifiable information:</u></strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><u>Agents</u><br>We use outside credit card processing companies to bill you for Paltalk services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.<br> We use outside email delivery systems to contact you and provide you with pertinent information via email. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</li>            
                                <li><u>Advertising</u><br>We use third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads to you on our behalf when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including personal information such as your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</li>            
                                <li><u>Legal Disclaimer</u><br>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</li>
                            </ul>            
                        	<u><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong></u><br>We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable 
                        information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information.<br><br>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or visiting <a href="http://register.paltalk.com/reg/ControllerServlet?RequestId=Register.ShowOptout&amp;src=paltalk" class="bodylink">http://register.paltalk.com/reg/ControllerServlet?RequestId=Register.ShowOptout&amp;src=paltalk</a>.

                        <strong><u>Log Files</u></strong><br>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This  information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.<br><br>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to administer the site and to track users' movements around the site.<br><br>We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information except during special promotions such as free trials when subscription IP addresses are temporarily tied to personally identifiable information.<br><br><strong><u>Cookies</u></strong><br>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use session ID cookies on this site to maintain your subscription and maintain your account. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.<br><br><strong><u>Clear Gifs</u></strong><br>We employ a software technology called clear gifs that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to  cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.<br><br>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”<br><br><strong><u>Third Party Advertisers</u></strong><br>The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by a Paltalk proprietary ad serving system. We share Web site usage information about users with reputable third party ad networks for the purpose of targeting our 
                        banner advertisements on Paltalk software.
                        <br><br>
                        We use third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads to you on our behalf when you visit our Web site.  These companies may use information (not including personal information such as your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

                        If you use a discussion room on Paltalk, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit

                        The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive

                        practices. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.

                        <strong><u>Business Transitions</u></strong><br>
                        In the event Paltalk goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another

                        likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership 
                        or control of your personal information.
