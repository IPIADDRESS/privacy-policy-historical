					<h2>Palm Privacy Policy</h2>
					<h4>Your privacy</h4>
					<p>At Palm, Inc. ("Palm"), we are committed to respecting your privacy. We recognize that when you provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. That's why we have put a policy in place to explain how we collect, use, and in some circumstances share, personal information we collect when you visit this website ("Website"), purchase products and services from us, or contact our sales or support associates. When more detailed information is required to explain our privacy practices with respect to a particular website, product, or service, we will provide separate notices that relate to those offerings.</p>

					<h4>What information do we collect and how do we use it?</h4>
					<p>At times, we may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable to you, such as your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number, as well as other non-public information associated with such information. Generally, this information is requested when you register for or use an online service or when you provide information in connection with a transaction or service.</p>
					<ul class="bulleted">
						<li>When you order, we will collect your name, e-mail address, shipping and billing addresses, telephone number, and credit card information.</li>
						<li>When you enter a contest or other promotional event, we will collect your name, e-mail address, address, or telephone number, so we can administer the contest and notify winners.</li>
						<li>When you register for an account or service, we will collect your name and e-mail address, and in some cases, your telephone number, address, the serial number of your product, credit card information, and approximate age.</li>
						<li>When you provide us feedback (for example, through our feedback forms) or other correspondence, we may collect the information you submit.</li>
						<li>When you use online services that we may provide, including those provided through your Palm device, we will collect data relevant to the service and as you designate.</li>
						<li>We may occasionally supplement the personal information you submitted to us with information from third party sources.</li>
						<li>Your IP address, browser, reference site domain name, and the pages you visit on the Website are logged when you visit the Website. This data is used to improve the content and functionality of the Website.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>We use the personal information we maintain about you to provide you with the services you request; measure consumer interest in our products and services; inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize your experience; resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; collect fees owed; detect and protect us against error, fraud and criminal activity; enforce our terms of use and for other legitimate business purposes; and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.</p>
					<p>We will occasionally send you information on special deals or promotions. If you wish to subscribe to our newsletters, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. We provide you with the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the <a href="http://pref.news.palmnewsletters.com/palm/palm_prefctr.asp?c=us&amp;b=generic">newsletter sign-up</a> section of the Website.</p>
					<p>We may create aggregate information records from personal information by excluding information that makes the information personally identifiable to you. Generally, we use this aggregate information in statistical analysis to help us analyze patterns in the use of our services. We reserve the right to use and disclose aggregate information at our discretion.</p>

					<h4>Regarding children</h4><p>Our Website is not designed for children under the age of 13. We do not intentionally gather personal information about visitors in that age group.</p>

					<h4>Contests and sweepstakes</h4>
					<p>If we run a contest or sweepstakes, please refer to the rules that we provide in connection with such contests or sweepstakes. The rules for each contest or sweepstakes will also detail how the information gathered from you for entry into the contest or sweepstakes will be used. We will share your personal information with third parties sponsoring the contest or sweepstakes. In addition, we will inform you in the contest or sweepstakes rules whether your personal information will be disclosed to any categories of companies not described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

					<h4>Links to other sites</h4>
					<p>The Website may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware of when you leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of each site that collects personal information.</p>

					<h4>How does Palm protect consumer information?</h4>
					<p>We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your sensitive personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of an encrypted communication with our servers.</p>
					<p>Although we have taken steps to ensure that your sensitive personal information is not intercepted, accessed, collected, used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons, you should know that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information and technical mistakes are possible. We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of electronically stored sensitive personal information via email or by conspicuous posting on the Website as soon as possible to the extent consistent with (a) the legitimate needs of law enforcement and (b) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>

					<h4>What about "cookies"?</h4>
					<p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies enable us to provide you with more personal service by helping us to identify our account holders and optimize their shopping experience. They do not include any data that will identify you personally. They will, however, allow you to use some specialized features. Cookies help us keep track of the preferences you specify. For example, when you tell us what in country you live, cookies enable us to provide the applicable content for you. Cookies also allow us to hold selections in your shopping cart when you leave a store on the Website without checking out. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that if you would rather not store the information for future use. You can configure your browser to accept or reject cookies, or notify you when a cookie is downloaded. If you reject all cookies on the Website, your experience will not be as optimal as it could be by accepting cookies. Each browser is different, so please check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your preferences.</p>

					<h4>Will Palm disclose the information it collects to outside parties?</h4>
					<p>Palm may store and disclose personal information as allowed or required by applicable law, including making disclosures that are necessary or advisable to: (a) protect the rights, safety or property of users of our Website, the public, Palm or its third party service providers and suppliers; and (b) conform to legal or regulatory requirements.</p>
					<p>Some parts of the Website and some product or service offerings are provided by third party service providers and suppliers. These third party service providers and suppliers collect or have access to your personal information to perform such services or fulfill a request from you. We may also provide your personal information to vendors to help us with different aspects of our business, including order fulfillment, order processing, shipping, credit card processing, dissemination of marketing and promotional offers, or understanding the use of our Website and services.</p>
					<p>If we merge with, or are acquired by another company, or sell all or substantially all of our relevant assets, or file for bankruptcy, we may disclose personal information to the acquirer.</p>
					<p>Under certain circumstances, Palm may choose to trade, sell or rent your personal information with trustworthy third parties, but you can tell us not to by going to our <a href="/us/company/legal/info_options.html">information sharing options</a> page and by unsubscribing at the <a href="http://pref.news.palmnewsletters.com/palm/palm_prefctr.asp?c=us&amp;b=generic">newsletter sign-up</a> section of the Website.</p>

					<h4>Choice and opt-out</h4>
					<p>If you set up an account with us to receive free newsletters and related communications, you may access the account and modify that information by logging in to your account and making the modifications. To do so, please go to the <a href="http://pref.news.palmnewsletters.com/palm/palm_prefctr.asp?c=us&amp;b=generic">newsletter sign-up</a> section of the Website. If you request that we deactivate your account: (1) we may retain aggregate information developed from your personal information, and (2) we may retain your personal information in our backup files.</p>

					<h4>Your consent</h4>
					<p>The provision of your personal information to Palm means that you agree and consent that we may collect, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy. In addition, from time to time and where appropriate, we may request your specific authorization or consent.</p>
					<p>If we decide to change our privacy practices, we will post those changes on this page so that you are kept informed of what data we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Please check this page for changes from time to time to make sure you are aware of our latest privacy practices.</p>
					<p>Because Palm operates globally, we make information we gather available to our worldwide business units. For those of you visiting us from the European Economic Area, please note that the personal data you enter will be transferred outside the European Economic Area for use by Palm and its affiliates for any of the purposes described above. By using our web site and providing us with your personal data, you consent to this transfer of your personal data.</p>

					<h4>Tell us what you think</h4>
					<p>Our goal is to respect your privacy. To help us improve our privacy policies, please give us your feedback. We welcome your <a href="mailto:privacy@palm.com">comments and questions</a>.</p>
