    <p>
      <strong>GENERAL PROVISIONS</strong><br>

      numbers) and access control mechanisms to control unauthorized access to systems
      and data.
    </p>
    <p>

      except as described in this Privacy Policy. Third-party disclosures may include
      sharing such information with Non-Affiliated Partners of the Company that perform
      technical support services for Client accounts or facilitate Client deals with the
      Company, including those that provide professional, legal, or accounting advice
      to the Company. Non-affiliated Partners that assist the Company in providing services
      to the Clients are required to maintain the confidentiality of such information
      to the extent that they receive it, and to use this personal information only in
      the course of providing such services, and only for the purposes that the Company
      dictates.
    </p>
    <p>

      to third parties as permitted by, or to comply with, applicable laws and regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Company may disclose personal information to cooperate with regulatory authorities
      and law enforcement agencies in complying with subpoenas or other official requests,
      and as necessary to protect Company rights or property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except as described in the present Privacy Policy, the Company will not use the
      Client's personal information for any other purpose unless the Company describes
      how such information will be used at the time the Client discloses it, or if the
      Company obtains the Client's express permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Company has the right to use the Client's Personal information in cases other
      than described in the present Privacy Policy if clearly stated at the time the information
      is disclosed by the Client or when the Company receives the Client's express permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>OPT OUT</strong><br>
      The Client may refuse to supply any of the Personal information that the Company
      may request. However, failure to do so may result in the Company being unable to
      open or maintain an account or to provide other services to the Client.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Company makes every effort to ensure that services, provided to its Clients
      are based on accurate, complete and up-to-date information about them, the Client

      are changes to his/her personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Client does not wish to have his/her Personal information disclosed to third
      parties as described in the present Privacy Policy, s/he should contact the Company
      via specific contact form.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>AMENDMENTS</strong><br>
      The Company reserves the right to make amendments to the present Privacy Policy.
      In particular, this may take place in cases that are not described directly or indirectly
      in the current edition of the Privacy Policy, or if a rule or law passes that requires
      such an amendment or addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>AMENDATORY PROCEDURE</strong><br>
      Should amendments be made, the Company shall inform the Clients of this by posting
      the relevant notice on the official Company Web site and by sending the relevant
      message to Clients via the internal mail system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Posting the relevant notice on the Company Website and sending messages via internal
      mail are considered to be adequate Client Privacy Policy of the amendments, whether
      the Client reads and understands a corresponding text or ignores it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amended document becomes effective after 5 (five) full astronomical days (120
      hours) following publication of the notice on the Company Web site, before this
      time the notice has only an informative nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amended document immediately applies to any accounts registered after its publication
      (irrespective of other accounts registered earlier, which its holder may possess).
    </p>
    <p>
      The amended document applies to trading accounts that were registered previous to
      the date the document in question went into effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case that a rule of law is introduced, which requires a corresponding amendment
      and/or addition to the present Privacy Policy, then the rule of law shall be applied
      immediately after the effective date of the relevant statutory act, whether the
      required amendment is made or not. Regulations of the present Privacy Policy that
      contradict the newly introduced rule or law become void once the corresponding amendments
      to the aforementioned document go into effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>ACCEPTANCE BY THE CLIENT</strong><br>
    </p>
    <p>

      documents for using the Company services and will immediately cease using such Company
