<p>This Privacy Policy applies:</p> 	
<ul>
<li><p>Regardless of whether you are accessing the Site via a personal computer, a mobile device 
or any other technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered (each, a "<u>Device</u>");</p></li>

<li><p>To all Information (as that term is defined below) collected by the Site (as defined above);</p></li>
<li><p>To our use of combined information if we combine Information (as that term is defined below) 
collected by the Site with other information we collect from other sources, such as information 
received from VII (for example, information collected at a physical location), marketing companies or 
Advertisers; and</p></li>
<li><p>Will remain in full force and effect even if your use of or participation in the Site or any 
particular service, feature, function or promotional activity offered through the Site terminates,

</ul>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not, unless specifically stated, apply to any Information (as that term is defined below) collected by any other company or collected in any other manner or by any other website, application or other interactive service offered by Viacom and/or its Affiliates.  Such information collection may be governed by separate privacy policies or notices.  In particular, see our <a href="“http://www.viacom.com/privacypolicy/Documents/Privacy_Shield_Privacy_Policy_Viacom.pdf”" target="_blank">Privacy Shield Privacy Policy</a> for information on our privacy policy and practices with respect to personal information transferred to the U.S.</p>

<p>By participating in this Site or any features, activities or services offered through the Site, 
you consent to our privacy practices as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Certain products or services offered by this Site may be subject to additional privacy practices, 
such as practices on how Information is collected, used, shared and/or disclosed by such products 
or services and/or how you may exercise choice with regard to such Information ("<u>Additional Privacy 
Statements</u>"). These Additional Privacy Statements, if any, shall be provided to you in conjunction 
with those products and services and are hereby incorporated in this Privacy Policy by reference. 
To the extent that there is a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Additional Privacy Statement 
for the activity in which you choose to participate, the Additional Privacy Statement shall govern.</p>

<a id="two" name="two"></a>
<h2 class="title2">2. U.S. Governing Law.</h2> 

<p>The Site is designed and targeted to U.S. audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance 
with the laws of the U.S. We make no representation that this Site is operated in accordance with the 
laws or regulations of, or governed by, other nations.</p>

<p>If you are located outside of the U.S., you use this Site at your own risk 
and initiative and you, not us, are responsible for compliance with any applicable local and national 
laws. Please be aware that any Personal Information and Other Information you provide to us or we 
obtain as a result of your use of this Site shall be collected in the U.S. and/or transferred to the 
U.S. and subject to U.S. law.</p>
<p>By using this Site, participating in any Site activities and/or providing us with your Personal 
Information and Other Information, you (a) consent to the transfer and/or processing of any Information 
to and in the U.S., (b) acknowledge that U.S. law may provide a lower standard of protection for 
personal data than the laws of your location and (c) understand that we shall collect, transfer, store, 
process and/or deal with your Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and U.S. law. 
Consequently, to the full extent permitted by law, you hereby waive any claims relating to the 
processing of your Personal Information or Other Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy 
that may arise under the laws and regulations that apply to you in or of any other country or 
jurisdiction.</p>
<a id="three" name="three"></a>
<h2 class="title2">3.	What Information Is Collected.</h2>
<p>When we use the term "<u>Personal Information</u>" we mean information that you provide us that 
identifies you or would allow someone to contact you, such as your full name, postal address, 
email address or telephone number. When we use the term "<u>Other Information</u>", we mean any 
information other than Personal Information that may be collected about you, including, but not 
limited to, Device and advertising identifiers and information collected through cookies or other 
Tracking Technologies or Identifiers (as those terms are defined below). Any Personal Information 
that is modified to remove your contact information and other information that identifies you or 
that is replaced with information that no longer identifies you or allows someone to contact you (for example, hashed email addresses or usernames)
shall not be treated as Personal Information but shall be treated as Other Information after such 
modification. (Personal Information and Other Information shall be referred to, together, as 
"<u>Information</u>".)</p>

<p><strong>3.1 Information We Collect that You Provide Us.</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>3.1.1	User Registration; Third Party Social Media Network Sign-On; Single VII Sign-On.</strong>
If we offer user registration on the Site, to register as a member of the Site, there may be a few 
options for you to register: Site Registration (as described below), Third Party Social Media Network 
Sign-On (as described below) and, if you have previously registered on another VII website, application 
or other interactive service using one of those methods, Single VII Sign-On (as defined and described below) 
if offered by this Site. In each case, you are required to either use a pre-existing user name and 
password (together, your "<u>User ID</u>") or select a new User ID. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.1.1.1 Site Registration.</strong>
For Site registration, you are required to select a User ID and may be required to also provide other

and/or required during the registration process. After you have registered for the Site under Site 
Registration, we may recognize you when you visit certain other VII websites, applications or other 
interactive services across Devices (such as when you login) and permit you to use Single VII Sign-On 
(as described below) to register for and login on such other websites, applications or other 
interactive services, but please note that other VII websites, applications or other interactive 
services may set additional or different requirements for membership, such as minimum age. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.1.1.2	Third Party Social Media Network Sign-On.</strong>
We may provide you with the ability to sign on to the Site by using third party social media network 
credentials ("<u>SMN</u>"). If you choose to sign-in through an SMN, you may be required to provide us with 
all or some of the Information required in the Site's registration form and your use of the Site shall 
be governed by the applicable SMN's privacy policy and user agreements as well as this Privacy Policy 
and the Site's <a href="/legal/terms-of-use">Terms of Use Agreement</a>. Please note that the 
SMN may set additional or different requirements for membership than those set for the Site, such as 
minimum age. We, and VII, are not responsible for the use of any such SMN, or for the accuracy, use 
or misuse of any information that you may disclose to or receive from an SMN or other third party in 
connection with such use. If you use an SMN to sign-in, we may receive certain information from such 
SMN and our use of your Information we receive from any SMN is governed by the relevant policies of 
any such SMN and any permissions you give us regarding your Information, including, but not limited to, 
those set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you have questions about whether a particular feature, 
function or service of the Site is powered by a third party, you may contact us with your question as 
provided in <u>Section 12.2</u> (Questions) below. 
</p>
<p>
After you have registered for the Site through SMN, we may recognize you when you visit certain other 
VII websites, applications or other interactive services and permit you to use Single VII Sign-On 
(as described below) to register for and login on such other websites, applications or other 
interactive services.

this Site ("<u>Single VII Sign-On</u>"), but please note that this Site may set additional or different 
requirements for membership, such as minimum age, than those requirements set by other VII websites, 
applications or other interactive services. 
</p>
<p>
Also note that, for your online privacy and security, if other people have access to your Device, 
we recommend you log out of your account after visiting any of the websites, applications or other 
interactive services that are associated with your account.

<a id="threetwo" name="threetwo"></a>
<strong>3.1.2 In Connection with Certain Features and Functions.</strong> 
We may also provide you with access to certain features or functions that we may offer on the Site, 
such as the option to participate in commenting, shopping and member profile pages. To sign up for 
or participate in these features or functions, you may be required to provide us with certain 
Information about you in order for us to personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions. 
For example, if we offer e-Commerce services on this Site, if you order any of our goods or services 
through such services, in addition to your name and contact information, we (or our operational service 
providers that we use to provide the e-Commerce service) may also collect and/or maintain your billing 
address, shipping address, selections, credit card or other payment instrument information, order number 
and information about your computer's internet address and website which may have referred or directed 
you to the Site (e.g., the referring URL). 
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Site may also provide features, functions and/or services powered by an SMN or other third 
party. For example, Information may be disclosed to an SMN through plug-ins offered by such SMN (such 
as Likes, Shares or commenting). Please take care when using any SMN or other third party service and 
familiarize yourself with the SMN's or other third party's policies and agreements, if any, that govern 
such use. </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.1.3	In Connection with Promotions such as Contests and Sweepstakes.</strong>
There may be a separate registration process to enter Promotions (as defined in the Site's 
<a href="/legal/terms-of-use">Terms of Use Agreement</a>) such as contests and sweepstakes 
which may require the submission of all or some of the following: your first and last name, street 
address, city, state and zip code, email address, telephone number and date of birth. Additional 
Information may be requested depending on the specific Promotion. The Promotion's entry page and/or 
Rules shall provide the specific requirements. You may also have the opportunity to opt-in to 
receive special Promotions or offers from our third party advertisers, sponsors or promotional 
partners ("<u>Advertisers</u>") as a result of your use of the Site in connection with these Promotions. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.2 Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Site and/or third parties may use "cookies", "web beacons", Flash local shared objects and other 
similar tracking technologies (collectively, "<u>Tracking Technologies</u>") to collect Other Information 
automatically as you browse the Site and the web. "<u>Cookies</u>" are typically html or browser-based text 
or other files (and often referred to as browser cookies) that help store information, user preferences 
and/or user activity. "<u>Web beacons</u>" (also known as image tags, gif, tracking pixels or web bugs) are 
small pieces of code used to collect data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising 
responses. Flash local shared objects ("<u>LSOs</u>") (sometimes known as Flash cookies and used if Adobe 
Flash is used) are text or other files that help store user preferences and/or activity.
</p>
<p>
These Tracking Technologies collect "click stream" data and additional Other Information regarding 
your visits to the Site (such as your visits to the Site's webpages, type of browser use, type of 
operating system used, date and time of viewing, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences) 
or other websites, applications or interactive services. Through these Tracking Technologies, we may 
collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on this Site and other websites, applications or 
other interactive services and may also collect or access your IP address (which is automatically assigned 
to any Device(s) and/or Device and Internet browser combination you use to access the Site) and/or set or 
access some other identifier unique to the Device(s), Device platform and/or Device-Internet browser 
combination you use to access the Site ("<u>Identifier</u>"). For example, we may set a unique alphanumeric 
Identifier unique to your home computer on Firefox, or access an Identifier provided by a mobile platform, 
such as the application or advertising Identifiers offered by Apple. Your Personal Information is not 
collected as part of this process but we may combine any or all of the Other Information we collect using 
Tracking Technologies and associate it and/or Identifiers with your Personal Information (such as your 
Single VII Sign-On ID) and/or with other non-personally identifiable unique identifiers assigned by VII or 
third parties. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.2.1	The Site's Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information.</strong>
</p>
<p>
By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge and understand that you 
are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site and other websites, 
applications or interactive services through these Tracking Technologies and that we may use Tracking 
Technologies in the emails we send to you. See <strong><u>Your Choices</u></strong> section below for more information on how 
you can withdraw your consent for certain purposes. 
</p>
<p>
We use Tracking Technologies to enable us to collect and then use Information as described in 
<a href="#fourtwo"> Section 4.2 "Other Information Collected by Us"</a> under <strong>"<u>How Is Collected Information 
Used</u>"</strong> below. For example, we use Tracking Technologies to enable Single VII Sign-On, to prevent you 
from seeing the same advertisements too many times or seeing advertisements too frequently, to tailor your 
experience on the Site by delivering relevant personalized advertising, email marketing and other content 
and to record if you have opted out of receiving personalized advertising from us. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.2.2	Third Parties' Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information.</strong> 
</p>
<p>
This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, data management 
platforms, supply side platforms, ad exchanges, traffic or audience measurement service providers, marketing 
analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, "<u>Third Party Service Providers</u>") to, for 
example, facilitate personalized advertisements ("<u>Customized Advertising</u>") and/or other content, serve 
advertisements on the Site and/or measure and analyze advertising or content effectiveness and/or traffic on 
the Site. Customized Advertising enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you for 
products and services that you might be interested in based on your visits to the Site and other websites, 
applications or other interactive services you have visited.
</p>
<p>
Third Party Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and other third parties, may themselves set and access 
their own Tracking Technologies on your Device subject to your choices about those Tracking Technologies (see 
<strong>"<u>Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers</u>"</strong> section below and <strong>"<u>More 
Information on Managing Tracking Technologies</u>"</strong> section below) and/or they may otherwise collect or have 
access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites when you 
use the Site.
</p>
<p>
We may also enlist the assistance of Third Party Service Providers so that the Site may set Tracking Technologies. 
For example, to the extent necessary to provide basic advertising serving services such as controlling how often 
you see advertisements or ensuring you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, we may enlist the assistance 
of such Third Party Service Providers to create, customize or modify Tracking Technologies set by the Site. See 
also Section 5.2.1 for more information on this Site's use of Nielsen's proprietary measurement software to collect 
and use video viewing metrics and other information.
</p>
<p>
Except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site, Third Party Service Providers do not have access to 
Tracking Technologies set by the Site, but we may provide to Third Party Service Providers certain Other 
Information collected by Tracking Technologies set by the Site in order for the Site to provide Customized 
Advertising or in order for the Third Party Service Providers to provide other services to the Site, such as 
measuring or analyzing advertising or content effectiveness or traffic on the Site. For example, in order to 
analyze traffic on the Site, we may provide to our Third Party Service Providers certain information we collect 
about your interaction with the Site along with an Identifier so that the Third Party Service Provider may provide 
analytics services to the Site.

<a id="moreinfotracking" name="moreinfotracking"></a><strong>5.2.3	More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies. </strong> 
With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Site, Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, please 
note the following with respect to the above opt-out options: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><u>Your Choices Regarding the Site's Use of Information for Customized Advertising</u>.</strong> 
You can prevent the Site's use of Information collected through Tracking Technologies for Customized Advertising by 
exercising the opt-outs offered by Third Party Service Providers we use as described in

</p></li>
<li><p><a id="moreinfocookie" name="moreinfocookie"></a><strong><u>More Information About Cookie Controls</u>.</strong> 

</p><p>For the following Internet browsers, you may prevent or exercise choices regarding browser cookies for a particular 
Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls described in the following:
</p>

<p>

<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/delete-manage-cookies#ie=ie-11" target="_blank">Internet Explorer 11</a><br>
<a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95647" target="_blank">Chrome</a><br>
<a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy/use-of-cookies" target="_blank">Safari</a><br>
<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer" target="_blank">Firefox</a><br>
</p>

<p>
If your Internet browser is not listed above or you otherwise are having difficulties with the links, you may be 
able to access controls to:
</p>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Delete <u>existing browser cookies</u> through the "Internet Options", "Settings", Preferences", "Options" or 
	similar menu selection in your browser's menu or otherwise as directed by your browser's support feature, which 
	means that all pre-existing browser cookies are deleted but does not prevent browser cookies from being used in 
	the future.</p></li>
	<li><p>Disable <u>browser cookies</u> through the same browser controls which means that browser cookies shall not 
	be used in the future but pre-existing browser cookies may not be deleted. Additional information on enabling 
	or disabling browser cookies and other Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser's support 
	feature. (See the "help" section of your browser for more information.) Disabling may sometimes be referred 
	to as blocking or opting out of browser cookies and relies on browser cookies to remember your choices. If you 
	delete browser cookies using the controls in your Web browser (as described above) after disabling browser 
	cookies, you may have to disable browser cookies again to re-establish your preferences.</p></li>
	<li><p>Choose to have the Device you use to access the Site warn you each time a browser cookie or certain other 
	non-Flash LSO Tracking Technology is being set. (You can later choose to turn-off such warnings.) This may be 
	available through your Internet browser on the Device you use to access the Site. Additional information on 
	warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser's support feature.</p></li>
	<li><p>Seek additional information from the provider of your Internet browser through your browser's support 
	features.</p></li>
	</ul>
<p>The above options may cover browser cookies set by the Site, browser cookies not set by the Site 
(sometimes called third party cookies) and/or both types of browser cookies. <strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT 
CONTROL AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPERATION OF THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS. ALSO, PLEASE NOTE THAT 
THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS ARE DIFFERENT FROM DO NOT TRACK OPTIONS THAT MAY ALSO BE OFFERED BY CERTAIN BROWSERS.
</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong><u>Many tools discussed above are "Internet browser cookie based"</u>.</strong> This means that such 
tools rely on cookies to remember your choices. For example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the 
controls in your Web browser after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking 
Technologies again to re-establish your preferences and, if you exercise opt-outs through the mechanisms described 
in our Ad Choices link, and then delete or block browser cookies, you may need to exercise your opt-outs through 
these mechanisms again.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><u>The tools are "Internet browser and Device-specific" or "Device-specific"</u>.</strong> Note that when 
you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific 
Internet browser on that Device and not across Devices. This means, for example, that if you block or disable 
browser cookies for Internet Explorer 9 on one Device, this choice shall not block or disable browser cookies 
when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device or on a different Device using Internet Explorer 9. Further, 
you may need to separately exercise your options for other platforms, such as mobile platform (as described below). 
See <a href="http://srp.viacom.com/sitefaq.html" target="_blank">our Ad Choices link here</a> for more information about this Site 
and other options you may have regarding Customized Advertising across Devices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><u>Automatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs</u>.</strong> 
Some Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable 
browser cookies from websites, applications or other interactive services other than those you visit directly 
(sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, <strong>if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to 
third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices 
to function.</strong> For example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the 
Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network 
Advertising Initiative site may not function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><u>You shall still receive advertisements</u>.</strong> Deleting or disabling Third Party Service 
Providers', Advertisers' or the Site's Tracking Technologies does not mean that you shall no longer receive online 
ads. If you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are 
automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no 
longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you shall continue to see ads on this Site 
and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable 
Tracking Technologies set by third parties or unless we offer alternative means such as enlisting the assistance 
of Third Party Service Providers in order for the Site to set Tracking Technologies for frequency capping purposes 
as described in the <strong>"<u><a href="#threetwo">Information Collected Through the Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</a></u>"</strong> 
section.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limitations Regarding Web Beacons.</strong> Web beacons cannot be deleted or disabled using the above 
opt-out options, but may be affected if such web beacons rely on browser cookies or other deleted or disabled 
Tracking Technologies to track your activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How to Manage Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies). Control of Flash LSOs (sometimes known as 
Flash Cookies) Must Be Handled Separately. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH LSOs TYPICALLY CANNOT BE 
CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR INTERNET BROWSER.</strong> Deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Tracking 
Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and set by this Site through the above options 
shall not remove Flash LSOs. For more information about Flash LSOs and how to remove them from your computer, 
please visit <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html" target="_blank">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html</a>. 
If you remove Flash LSOs, you may not have access to certain features of the Site and some of our other services 
may not function properly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Effects of Managing Tracking Technologies.</strong> In addition to the above, if you delete or 
disable Tracking Technologies set by the Site, the Site may no longer be able to offer certain features or 
functionality to you, such as remembering your preferences, remembering your username, enabling Single VII 
Sign-On, saving your player settings or other purposes described in <a href="#fourtwo">"Other Information 
Collected By Us"</a> above, and some of our other services may not function properly. In addition to the above, 
if you disable or delete Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers (or if such 
Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled on your Device or browser), the Site may no longer be able to 
offer certain functionality to you, such as enabling SMN login or saving your player settings and certain services 
or advertisements may not work for such Devices or browsers.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mobile Platforms.</strong> Certain mobile platforms, such as Apple or Google, may offer users choice 
regarding the Identifiers we, Third Party Service Providers or Advertisers may access and use, which may not be 
browser cookie based. We encourage you to review and understand the choices that such mobile platforms may provide 
to you regarding these Identifiers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Certain Identifiers.</strong> Certain Identifiers we set may not be deleted, blocked or disabled using 
the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such Identifiers rely on, or are associated with, browser cookies 
or other Tracking Technologies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.</strong> Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" 
signals to the websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers 
incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be 
transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among 
participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should 
do when they receive such signals. 
</p>
<p>
We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and 
accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals. Instead, as described above, please see the link to the 
Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice 
regarding Information collected for Customized Advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other 
mechanisms described in this Section 5.2.3 and in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.</p></li>

the child or Ineligible Teenager (the "<u>Parent</u>"), may unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text 
messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is 
available to a Parent of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state). 

In addition, Parents who wish to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership must either (i) use

Ineligible Teenager's User ID, the URL of the Site and request to terminate your child's or Ineligible Teenager's 
account and registration or (iii), if a Parent does not have his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID, 
send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@viacom.com?subject=ParamountNetwork.com%20Deactivating%20Ineligible%20Account">privacy@viacom.com</a> (or, if available, contact us by using 
the Site's ContactUs tool) that includes the Parent's name, 
address, telephone and email address, the child's or Ineligible Teenager's name and/or email address as registered 
on the Site, and the URL of the Site. If a Parent sends an email under subsections (ii) or (iii), the Site may 
send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate 
his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration and may provide or request additional 
information (for example, requesting that the Parent provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or 
legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager) before terminating the child's or Ineligible Teenager's 
account and, upon or prior to termination, may notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request 
via email and identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.
