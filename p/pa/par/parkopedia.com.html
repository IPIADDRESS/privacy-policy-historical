            <div class="content">
                <p>Parkopedia Limited (including its affiliates) (<strong>Parkopedia</strong>, <strong>we</strong>, <strong>our</strong>, <strong>us</strong> or the <strong>Company</strong>) is the controller of your personal data and is committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of its Users. We believe that you have a right to know our practices regarding the information we may collect and use when you use the Service.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy (<strong>Policy</strong>) relates to services provided through our website and application (<strong>Services</strong>) and sets out the basis on which the personal data collected from you, or that you provide to Us will be processed by Us. This Policy also describes Our practices for collecting, using, maintaining and processing information.</p>
<p>Parkopedia is a cloud-based web platform that enables Users to find the closest parking to their destination, tells them how much it will cost and whether the space is available, and where possible allows for the Reservation of a parking space globally (the <strong>Service</strong>).</p>
<p>A User may be either an entity, for example a car park operator who maintains facility data in the Parkopedia Service (<strong>Operator(s)</strong>) or a member of the public who uses the Parkopedia Service to search or reserve parking (<strong>End User(s)</strong>) (Operator and End User shall collectively be referred to as <strong>Users</strong> or <strong>you</strong>).</p>
<p>Users who wish to use the Service may be asked to provide Parkopedia, with certain information including Personal Information as further detailed in this Privacy Policy (“Data”). Our use of this Data in connection with the Services will be undertaken in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</p>
<p>By using our Services, you acknowledge you have read and understood this privacy policy.</p>
<h1>Information we may collect</h1>
<p>There are two categories of data that we collect from our Users.</p>
<p>Data we collect when using the Service;</p>
<p>The first type of Data is non-identifiable and anonymous information (<strong>Non-personal Information</strong>). We are not aware of the identity of the User from which we have collected Non- Personal Information. Non-Personal Information is any unconcealed information which is available to us while Users are using the Service. Non-personal Information which is being gathered consists of technical information and behavioural information which may include</p>
<ul>
<li>a User’s anonymised Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet</li>
<li>the uniform resource locators (URL)</li>
<li>operating system</li>
<li>type of browser</li>
<li>browser plug-in types and versions</li>
<li>Flash version</li>
<li>the period of time the User visited the website</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-Personal Information is collected through your use of our Service</strong>. This means that then you are using our Service we are aware of it and may gather, collect and record the information relating to such usage, either independently or through the help of third-party services such as Google Analytics.
Data you give us;</p>
<p>The second category of data is individually identifiable information (<strong>Personal information</strong>);</p>
<p>Personal information of a User which is being gathered can consist of; username, password, email, facebook ID, IP address, first name , last name, postcode, vehicle registration mark, and Credit card details.</p>
<p><strong>We will never sell your Personal Information to third parties. (for more information see the Section titled: “Who we share your data with”).</strong></p>
<p>You do not have any legal obligation to provide any information to Parkopedia and can use our Services without providing Personal Information.  However, we require certain information in order to provide additional Services to you.  Login credentials (email and username) are required to access Service such as; application premium subscriptions, to participate in gamification of reporting parking coverage, and to book a parking reservation. We may keep such Personal Information in a database which will be owned and maintained by Us (the <strong>Data Controller</strong>) in accordance with this policy (for more information see the Section titled: How long we keep your personal data).</p>
<p>Parkopedia may also collect the email addresses and retain communication from users who contact Us via email or messenger services.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information is collected because you provide it to Us voluntarily</strong>. We collect Personal Information from you when you would like to operate the elements of our additional Service which are described below.</p>

<h1>Who we share your data with</h1>
<p><strong>Third parties who we may share your data with:</strong></p>
<p>Although Parkopedia processes transactions when You make a parking reservation, the credit card details are never known to us.  Through the signup process credit card details are provided by You direct to our payment authorisation partner, Stripe (<a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy/">https://stripe.com/us/privacy/</a>) who securely manage the details and provide Us with a token key which we store against your details for future transactions.</p>
<p>Email and vehicle registration details are shared with reservation partners to enable the booking of parking reservations to fulfil our contractual obligations with You.  By default we do not ask you for your first and last name, however if this is required in order to make a parking reservation we will prompt you to make that decision to provide the additional details.</p>
<p>Non-Personal anonymised data is shared with ‘Google Analytics’ to allow Parkopedia to analyse the usage and performance of its Services.</p>
<p>We may also <strong>disclose your personal information to third parties:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in our corporate group who may act as joint controllers or processors and who may be based inside or outside the EU;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Parkopedia’s assets are acquired by a third party, including by way of a merger, share acquisition, asset purchase or any similar transaction, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Including service providers who may act as processors based inside or outside the EU and who provide IT, system administration and other services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Including professional advisers who may act as processors including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based inside or outside the EU who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Parkopedia has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, enforce applicable Terms and Conditions, including investigation of potential violations thereof. Such parties may include HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities who may act as processors based inside or outside the EU who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Parkopedia, including Users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to enforce or apply our terms of supply terms and other agreements with you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For avoidance of doubt, Parkopedia may transfer and disclose Non-Personal Information to third parties at its own discretion, which does not serve to identify individuals for example number of Users who searched for a particular area, or how many Users clicked on a advertisement or sponsored link.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<h1>Where we store you personal data</h1>
<p>The Data we collect from you (<strong>personal</strong> and <strong>non-personal</strong>) is hosted on the Amazon AWS Cloud data centre in the European Economic Area (EEA) and is compliant with the ISO 27001 security standard (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/">https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/</a>).  Advanced security features are not only inherently built into the Amazon AWS cloud, but also into the Parkopedia Services.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the Data we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in order to fulfil our Service commitment with You.</p>
<p>Where your Data is transferred outside of the EEA, in particular with Parkopedia’s reservation service partners (‘Data Processors’) we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Data is subject to appropriate safeguards and that at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your data may also be accessible to Parkopedia customer support staff who are based outside of the EU.  Where customer support is required, your data will remain in the EEA in order to safeguard your privacy rights.</p>
<p>We may transfer your personal data outside of the EEA, in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enable us to provide you with the Services (via Data Processors) and fulfil our contract with you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fulfil any legal obligations which require us to make that transfer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitate the operation of our group business, where it is in our legitimate interests and we have concluded these are not overridden by your rights.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>How we store your personal data</h1>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Parkopedia takes great care in implementing, enforcing and maintaining the security of our Service, and of the personal data that our Users provide us.  We take appropriate measures to ensure that all personal data is kept secure including security measures to prevent personal data from being accidentally lost, used/modified/destroyed or accessed in an unauthorised way, for the duration of your use of our Services. We limit access to your personal data to those who have a genuine business need to know it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorised manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>Parkopedia will act in accordance with the <strong>Guidance from the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) on personal data security breaches under the General Data Protection Regulation</strong>. We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We shall act in accordance with these policies to notify you and any applicable regulator, in the event of a suspected data security breach where We are legally required to do so.  In the event of a security breach Parkopedia will promptly take remedial measures to restore the security of personal data, and to limit the unauthorised access or illegal transfer of personal data.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping your personal data up to date</strong></p>
<p>If your personal details change you may update them by contacting Us using the contact details below.</p>
<p>We will endeavour to update your personal data within thirty (30) days of any new or updated personal data being provided to Us, in order to ensure that the personal data We hold about you is as accurate and up to date as possible.</p>
<p><strong>How long we keep your personal data</strong></p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for at least six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
<p>Details of other retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are contained in our retention policy which you can request from us by contacting <a href="mailto://privacy@parkopedia.com">privacy@parkopedia.com</a>.</p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data and in some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<p>Some metadata and statistical information concerning the use of the Service will not be deleted and shall be kept in an anonymized manner.  This data is not subject to the personal information procedures in this policy and may be retained by Us. We will not be able to identify you from this data. Some data may also be retained on our third-party service providers’ servers until deleted in accordance with their privacy policy and their retention policy.</p>
