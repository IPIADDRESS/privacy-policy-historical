            Welcome to Parsely, Inc. (“Parse.ly,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), the
            operator of the Parse.ly Analytics Service that allows customers to
            track usage and activity on websites and applications on a
            non-personal basis; to perform analytics related to the tracking;
            and, to store, query, aggregate, and export data related to the
            tracking (the “Analytics Service”). The Analytics Service powers
            several Parse.ly products that may go by names such as Parse.ly
            Dashboard, Parse.ly Data Pipeline, Parse.ly API, Parse.ly Insights,
            and other such names, as detailed on Parse.ly's public website.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have created this privacy statement (“Privacy Statement”) in
            order to demonstrate our commitment to you (“you” or “your”), our
            user, regarding your privacy with respect to information that you
            submit to Parse.ly through http://parsely.com or http://parse.ly
            (the “Site” as further defined below) or via the Analytics Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a general rule, there are two categories of users of the Site
            and Analytics Service: "Customers" who are operators or publishers
            of websites and applications that integrate the Parse.ly Analytics
            Service (“Customer Sites”), and "Visitors" who are individual
            visitors of a Site or Application operated by the Customer, and
            which makes use of the Analytics Service.
    	</p>
    	<p>
            Because we gather important information from users of the Site and
            Customer Sites, as well as related services provided by Parse.ly
            (collectively, the “Services”), we have established this Privacy
            Statement as a means to communicate our information collection,
            use, and dissemination practices. In order to access and use the
            Analytics Service, you must agree to our Terms of Service and any
            other applicable terms. Capitalized terms not defined in this
            Privacy Statement will have the meaning ascribed to them in the
            Terms of Service.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		So we are clear on the terminology: “Personal Information” means
            contact information (e.g., your name, address, email address, and/or
            telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used
            or intended to be used to personally identify an individual, and any
            other non-public information that is associated with that information.
            “Anonymous Information” means information that is not used or
            intended to be used to personally identify an individual.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		BY USING OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION
            THROUGH OUR SITE OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY
            STATEMENT AND YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
            PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT. YOUR
            PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US OR ON OUR BEHALF IN THE
            COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING
            THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL
            INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.
    	</p>
    	<h2>
            Collection and Use of Information Through the Site
        </h2>
    	<p>
    		Visitors and Customers: We collect Personal Information about
            Visitors only when it is submitted voluntarily. This may occur when
            you send us an email or otherwise communicate with us. If you are
            accessing the Site or Services on behalf of a Customer, you may
            provide certain information when you register, for example, your
            organization’s name, email address, and password. We also collect
            certain Personal Information from Customers in order to process
            subscriptions, including credit card numbers and associated billing
            information. We refer to this information as “Billing Information”.
            Whether you are a Visitor or a Customer, we use your Personal
            Information to respond to your requests, resolve problems, improve
            the quality of the Site and Services, and market our products or
            services and those of third parties to you through the Site or other
            means of communication. Having said that, we use your Billing
            Information only for purposes of authentication and to process your
            payments.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Whether you are a Visitor or acting on behalf of a Customer as
            part of the registration process, we may collect and store Anonymous
            Information including your Internet protocol address, domain names,
            browser, device type, access times, the web pages you view, and other
            tracked user actions. When doing so, we may use Cookies (as
            defined below), web bugs, device information, and navigational data
            like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information
            regarding the date and time of your visit, as well as your geo-location
            (from your IP address). “Cookies” are small pieces of information
            that a website sends to your browser. Standing alone, Cookies do
            not personally identify you but merely recognize your web browser.
            Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet
            browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, you
            may experience session errors and may need to log-in again each
            time you use the Services. We may also anonymize your Personal
            Information by removing identifying characteristics and aggregating
            it with the information of others so that it becomes Anonymous
            Information. We may use Anonymous Information without restriction.

    	<h2>
            Collection and Use of Information Through the Analytics Service
        </h2>
    	<p>
            Visitors: If you are a Visitor on a Customer Site, we will not
            collect any Personal Information about you without your express
            authorization. We may, however, collect and store Anonymous
            Information including your Internet protocol address, domain names,
            browser, device type, access times, the web pages you view, and
