<p>Welcome to Parsely, Inc. (“ Parse.ly ,” “ we ,” “ us ,” or “ our ”), the operator of the Parse.ly Analytics Service that allows publishers to track usage and activity on their own website on a non-personal basis and perform analytics related to the tracking (the “ Analytics Service ”). We have created this privacy statement (“ Privacy Statement ”) in order to demonstrate our commitment to you (“ you ” or “ your ”), our user, regarding your privacy with respect to information that you submit to Parse.ly through parsely.com  (the “Site” as further defined below) or the Analytics Service. As a general rule, there are two categories of users of the Site and Analytics Service: " Publishers " who are operators or publishers of websites that make the Parse.ly Analytics Service available on their website (“ Publisher Sites ”), and " Visitors " who are individual visitors of the Site or a Publisher Site.</p>
<p>Because we gather important information from users of the Site and Publisher Sites, as well as related services provided by Parse.ly (collectively, the “ Services ”), we have established this Privacy Statement as a means to communicate our information collection, use and dissemination practices.  In order to access and use the Analytics Service, you must agree to our Terms of Service and any other applicable terms.  Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Statement will have the meaning ascribed to them in the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>So we are clear on the terminology: “ Personal Information ” means contact information (e.g., your name, address, email address, and/or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual, and any other non-public information that is associated with that information.  “ Anonymous Information ” means information that is not used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual.</p>
<p>BY USING OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SITE OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT AND YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US OR ON OUR BEHALF IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.</p>

If you choose to disable Cookies, you may experience session errors and may need to log-in again each time you use the Services.  We may also anonymize your Personal Information by removing identifying characteristics and aggregating it with the information of others so that it becomes Anonymous Information.  We may use Anonymous Information without restriction.</p>
