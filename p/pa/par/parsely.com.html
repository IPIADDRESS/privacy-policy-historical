            <h1>Parse.ly Privacy Policy.</h1>
<p>Welcome to Parsely, Inc. (“ Parse.ly ,” “ we ,” “ us ,” or “ our ”), the operator of the Parse.ly Dash Service analytics service that allows publishers to track usage and activity on their own website on a non-personal basis and perform analytics related to the tracking (the “ Dash Service ”). We have created this privacy statement (“ Privacy Statement ”) in order to demonstrate our commitment to you (“ you ” or “ your ”), our user, regarding your privacy with respect to information that you submit to Parse.ly through parsely.com  (the “Site” as further defined below) or the Dash Service. As a general rule, there are two categories of users of the Site and Dash Service: " Publishers " who are operators or publishers of websites that make the Parse.ly Dash Service available on their website (“ Publisher Sites ”), and " Visitors " who are individual visitors of the Site or a Publisher Site.</p>
<p>Because we gather important information from users of the Site and Publisher Sites, as well as related services provided by Parse.ly (collectively, the “ Services ”), we have established this Privacy Statement as a means to communicate our information collection, use and dissemination practices.  In order to access and use the Dash Service, you must agree to our Terms of Service and any other applicable terms.  Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Statement will have the meaning ascribed to them in the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>So we are clear on the terminology: “ Personal Information ” means contact information (e.g., your name, address, email address, and/or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual, and any other non-public information that is associated with that information.  “ Anonymous Information ” means information that is not used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual.</p>
<p>BY USING OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SITE OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT AND YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US OR ON OUR BEHALF IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.</p>
<h2>Collection and use of Information</h2>
<h2>Through the Site</h2>
<p>Visito rs and   Publishers : We collect Personal Information about Visitors only when it is submitted voluntarily.  This may occur when you send us an email or otherwise communicate with us.  If you are accessing the Site or Services on behalf of a Publisher, you may provide certain information when you register, for example, your organization’s name, email address and password. We also collect certain Personal Information from Publishers in order to process subscriptions, including credit card numbers and associated billing information. We refer to this information as “ Billing Information ”. Whether you are a Visitor or a Publisher, we use your Personal Information to respond to your requests, resolve problems, improve the quality of the Site and Services, and market our products or services and those of third parties to you through the Site or other means of communication.  Having said that, we use your Billing Information, only for purposes of authentication and to process your payments.</p>
<p>Whether you are a Visitor or acting on behalf of a Publisher as part of the registration process, we may collect and store Anonymous Information including your Internet protocol address, domain names, browser, device type, access times, and the web pages you view.  When doing so, we may use Cookies (as defined below), web bugs and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, and your geo-location (from your IP address). “ Cookies ” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your browser. Standing alone, Cookies do not personally identify you but merely recognize your web browser. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions.  If you choose to disable Cookies, you may experience session errors and may need to log-in again each time you use the Services.  We may also anonymize your Personal Information by removing identifying characteristics and aggregating it with the information of others so that it becomes Anonymous Information.  We may use Anonymous Information without restriction.</p>
<h2>Through the Dash Service</h2>
<p>Visitors : If you are a Visitor on a Publisher Site, we will not collect any Personal Information about you without your express authorization.  We may, however, collect and store Anonymous Information including your Internet protocol address, domain names, browser, device type, access times, and the web pages you view.  When doing so, we may also use Cookies (as defined below), web bugs and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, your geo-location (from your IP address). “ Cookies ” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your browser. Standing alone, Cookies do not personally identify you but merely recognize your web browser. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions.  If you choose to disable Cookies, you may experience session errors and may need to log-in again each time you use the Services.  We use your Anonymous information to: provide the Dash Services to the Publisher, to improve the quality of the Site and the Services, to create compilations of aggregated data and/or statistics .  If you prefer that we do not collect even Anonymous Information about you on Publisher Sites, please click here:  <a href="http://srv.config.parsely.com/optout">OPT OUT OF PARSE.LY TRACKING</a></p>
<p>Publishers : In providing the Dash Service, we will be collecting information on the Publisher Sites (e.g., tracking Visitors to the Publisher Site on a non-personal basis), you will use our analytics engine through a password protected section of the Site and you will, generally, be interacting with the Dash Service.  Any information we collect through the Publisher’s use of the Dash Service will be called the “ Dash Data ”.  We use the Dash Data in accordance with the subscription agreement that we have with you.</p>
<p>Usage of Third Party Cookies
We may use third party tracking services to track and analyze Anonymous Information from Visitors of our Site and Services. Such third parties may use Cookies to help track Visitor behavior. Such Cookies will not be used to associate individual Visitors of a Site to any Personal Information.</p>

<h2>Accessing and Controlling your Information</h2>

You authorize us to use and disclose any new or modified information that you provide in accordance with this Privacy Statement, and you agree that we are under no obligation to delete or modify information that you have previously chosen to provide us. Please remember, however, if we have already disclosed some of your Personal Information to third parties, we cannot access that Personal Information any longer and cannot force the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to whom we have made those disclosures.</p>
<p>Upon your request, we will close your Account as soon as reasonably possible, in accordance with applicable law.
