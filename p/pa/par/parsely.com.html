    <p>Parsely, Inc.
    ("<b>Parse.ly</b>", "<b>we</b>," "<b>us</b>," or "<b>our</b>"), is committed
    to protecting and respecting your privacy. Our Parse.ly Analytics Service
    allows customers to track usage and activity on websites and applications on a
    non-personal basis; to perform analytics related to the tracking; and, to
    store, query, aggregate, and export data related to the tracking (the
    "<b>Analytics Service</b>"). The Analytics Service powers several Parse.ly
    products that go by names such as Parse.ly Analytics, Parse.ly Dashboard,
    Parse.ly Video Analytics, Parse.ly Mobile App, Parse.ly Overlay, Parse.ly SDK,
    Parse.ly Data Pipeline, Parse.ly API, and other such names, as detailed on our
    website at http://parse.ly (the "<b>Site</b>").</p>

    <p>We have
    created this Privacy Policy ("<b>Privacy Policy</b>") in order to demonstrate
    our commitment to you ("<b>you</b>" or "<b>your</b>"), our users, regarding
    your privacy with respect to information that you submit to Parse.ly or that
    we collect about you through the Site or via the Analytics Service.</p>

    <p>As a general
    rule, there are two categories of users of the Site and Analytics Service: Our
    "<b>Customers</b>", who are operators or publishers of websites and
    applications that integrate the Parse.ly Analytics Service ("<b>Customer
    Sites</b>"), and "<b>Visitors</b>", who are visitors to our Site or who are
    visitors to Customer Sites integrating the Parse.ly Analytics Service and
    about whom we may receive Personal Information from our Customers.</p>

    <p>This Privacy
    Policy does not apply to information of any kind that we collect by means
    (including offline means) or from sources other than those specified
    herein.</p>

    <p>Because we
    gather important information from Customers and Visitors of the Site and
    Customer Sites, as well as related services provided by Parse.ly
    (collectively, the "<b>Services</b>"), we have established this Privacy Policy
    as a means to communicate our information collection, use, and dissemination
    practices.

    </p><p>In order to access and use the Services, you must agree to our Site
    Terms of Service at <a href="https://parse.ly/site-terms">https://parse.ly/site-terms</a>
    (applicable to all Visitors) and our Product Terms of Service at <a href="https://parse.ly/product-terms">https://parse.ly/product-terms</a>
    (applicable only to Customers) (the "<b>Terms</b>"). Capitalized terms
    not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in the
    Terms.</p>

    <p>As used in
    this Privacy Policy, "<b>Personal Information</b>" means any information or
    set of information about an identified or identifiable natural person, where
    an <i>identifiable</i> natural person is one who can be identified by all
    means reasonably likely to be used by any person to identify the natural
    person directly or indirectly. "<b>Personal Information</b>" does not include
    information that is <i>not</i> associated with an identified or identifiable
    individual or information that is reported in the aggregate (provided that
    such aggregated information is not identifiable to a natural person), and does
    not include information as to which identifying characteristics have been
    removed without means reasonably likely to be used by any person to
    re-identify the natural person directly or indirectly.</p>

    <h2>NOTICE</h2>

    <p>Where
    Parse.ly collects or receives Personal Information about Visitors directly
    from Visitors, we will explain the purposes for which we collect and use such
    Personal Information, the types of third parties to which we disclose that
    information, and the choices and means, if any, we offer you for limiting the
    use and disclosure of Personal Information about you. This explanation will be
    provided as soon as practicable and, in any event, before we disclose your
    Personal Information or use such information for a purpose materially
    different than that for which it was originally collected or processed.</p>

    <p>Where
    Parse.ly collects or receives Personal Information about Visitors from our
    Customers, which occurs when we are acting as a provider of Services to our
    Customers on Customer Sites, we do so as a processor of Personal Information
    on behalf of our Customers. We will use such information in accordance with
    the notices provided to Visitors by our Customers and in accordance with the
    choices Visitors made with respect to such Personal Information, as
    communicated to us by our Customers.&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>Collection and Use of Information Through Our Site</h3>

    <p><u>Visitor-
    and Customer-Provided Information</u>: When Visitors visit our Site, we may
    collect certain types of information about you that you submit voluntarily.
    This information is "Personal Information" since it identifies you, and may
    include your name, address, email address, and telephone number. This may
    occur when you send us an email, submit a website form requesting information
    about Parse.ly or our Services, use an on-site live chat service, or otherwise
    communicate with us. Our legal basis for processing this information is your
    consent, the performance of a contract between you and us and our legitimate
    interests, namely the proper administration of our Site and communications
    with Visitors.</p>

    <p>

    <p>
    <u>Registration and Billing Information Through the Analytics Service</u>:
    When Visitors access the Services on behalf of a Customer, we may process
    information about you that was provided by you when you registered, for
    example, the Customer's name, email address, and password ("<b>Registration
    Information</b>"). We also collect certain information from Visitors accessing
    the Services on behalf of a Customer, including credit card numbers and
    associated billing information ("<b>Billing Information</b>") in order to
    process subscriptions. Our legal basis for processing this information is the
    performance of a contract between our Customer and us.</p>

    that we collect through the Analytics Service to provide our Services to our

    Customers only to process Customer payments. We may also anonymize such
    information by removing identifying characteristics (if any) and aggregating
    it with the information of others. We may use such information to create

    <h2>CHOICE<br>
        (Disclosing Personal Information to Third Parties)</h2>

    <p>Parse.ly will
    offer you the opportunity to choose whether your Personal Information is to be
    used for a purpose materially different from the purpose for which it was
    originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.</p>

    <p>Parse.ly does
    not request or knowingly receive or collect Sensitive Personal Information.
    Nonetheless, if at any point in the future Parse.ly receives or collects
    Sensitive Personal Information about you, Parse.ly will not process such
    information about you for purposes other than those for which the information
    was originally obtained or subsequently authorized by you unless you
    explicitly consent to the processing, or as required or permitted, or where
    not prohibited by law or regulation. "<b>Sensitive Personal Information</b>"
    means Personal Information that reveals race, ethnic origin, political
    opinion, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic
    data, biometric data where processed to uniquely identify a person, any
    information that concerns medical or health conditions or sex life, or
    information relating to the commission of a criminal offense.</p>

    <p>Parse.ly may
    disclose your Personal Information: To third party vendors or service
    providers who help us provide the Services or the Site, including database
    hosting and data processing services, and assist us in responding to requests
    by you for information that you request (including your rights covered by the
    provisions in this Privacy Policy under Accessing and Controlling Your
    Personal Information); To third parties to whom you ask us to send your
    information; To a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other
    companies under a common control (collectively, "<b>Affiliates</b>"), provided
    that we require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy; To a company that
    merges with us, acquires us, or purchases our assets, in which case such
    company may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this
    Privacy Policy; or If we believe in good faith that such disclosure is
    necessary to (a) resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our Terms;
    (b) comply with relevant laws or to respond to requests from law enforcement
    or other government officials relating to investigations or alleged illegal
    activity or in connection with our own investigation of suspected or actual
    illegal activity, in which case we may (and you hereby authorize us to)
    disclose Personal Information without subpoenas or warrants served on us; or
    (c) protect and defend our rights or property or the rights and property of
    you or third parties; or (d) to prevent physical harm to an individual or
    financial loss.</p>

    <h3>Opting Out of Collecting Information About You on Customer Sites<br>
        (For Visitors to Customer Sites)</h3>

    <p>When Visitors
    visit our Customer Sites, we may process information about you that is
    provided to us by our Clients. If you prefer that we do not process Personal
    Information about you on Customer Sites provided to us by our Clients, please
    visit http://srv.config.parsely.com/optout, or

    </p><p><a href="http://srv.config.parsely.com/optout">CLICK HERE TO OPT OUT OF
        PARSE.LY TRACKING.</a></p>

    <p>Please note that this opt-out link sets a persistent cross-site cookie (also called a
    "third-party cookie") that instructs our standard integration module for the
    Analytics Service not to store information related to your usage. However, you
    may find it more convenient to leverage a tracking protection service to
    opt-out of our Analytics Service tracking. This is because, for technical
    reasons related to the default configuration of the software of third parties
    that we cannot control, our opt-out link does not work in every browser,
    operating system and device environment. To more effectively opt-out of
    Parse.ly tracking, you may use a "tracking script blocking tool", such as the
    "Tracking Protection" feature provided by the open source Mozilla Firefox web
    browser. Similar tools exist for mobile applications and other browsers. To
    block Parse.ly tracking using these tools, you may blacklist this domain:
    pixel.parsely.com.</p>

    <h3>Opting Out of Marketing Communications</h3>

    <p>If you
    receive marketing or promotional emails from us, you may unsubscribe at any
    time by following the instructions contained within the email or by sending an
    email to the address provided in the "Contact Us" section.</p>


    <h2>ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ONWARD TRANSFER</h2>

    <p>In the
    performance of our Services and business operations, Personal Information we
    collect or receive may be stored or transferred internationally throughout our
    organization and to our service providers or agents, in accordance with
    applicable data privacy laws. Transfers to third parties are covered by the
    provisions in this Privacy Policy under Notice and Choice.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Parse.ly will
    endeavor to obtain assurances that any such service provider or agent will
    provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this
    Privacy Policy and, with respect to any Personal Information of EU citizens,
    the Privacy Shield Principles (see below), and will notify Parse.ly if it
    makes a determination it can no longer meet this obligation.</p>

    <p>Parse.ly is a
    participant in the U.S. Department of Commerce's EU-U.S. and Swiss-US Privacy
    Shield Frameworks, and has certified that we adhere to the Privacy Shield
    Principles. Parse.ly is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of
    the Federal Trade Commission. We also use model contractual clauses and other
    mechanisms approved by the European Union and Switzerland, respectively, for
    transfers of Personal Information from the European Economic Area
    ("<b>EEA</b>") and Switzerland.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>For more
    information about the EU-U.S. and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks, visit
    the U.S. Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield website at
    https://www.privacyshield.gov/
    (or <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">click here</a>).

    </p><p>Where
    Parse.ly knows that any third party to whom it has provided Personal
    Information is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner contrary
    to this Privacy Policy, Parse.ly will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop
    the use or disclosure. With respect to such onward transfers to agents, and to
    the extent Parse.ly is responsible for the event, Parse.ly will remain liable
    should its agents process Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with
    the Privacy Shield Principles (where applicable) and this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>DATA SECURITY</h2>

    <p>We follow
    generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to
    us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Taking into account the
    risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information we
    process, Parse.ly maintains appropriate administrative, technical, and
    physical safeguards to protect Personal Information in our possession against
    accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration,
    unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of
    processing. This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection,
    encryption, and other access and authentication controls.</p>

    <p>However, no
    method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is
    100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you
    transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk. We
    also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed,
    altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or
    managerial safeguards. If you believe your Personal Information has been
    compromised, please contact us as set forth in the "Contact Us" section.</p>

    <p>We have a
    security incident response program designed to promptly respond to and
    escalate any potential privacy or security incident. If we learn of a security
    incident, we will inform you and the authorities of the occurrence of the
    breach in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>DATA INTEGRITY AND PURPOSE LIMITATION</h2>

    <p>Parse.ly
    endeavors to use Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with
    the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the
    Individual. Parse.ly will take reasonable steps designed to ensure that only
    Personal Information that is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete,
    current, and otherwise reliable in relation to the purposes for which the
    information was obtained is used by Parse.ly for as long as Parse.ly retains
    possession of such information. Parse.ly's Personnel have a responsibility to
    assist Parse.ly in maintaining accurate, complete, and current Personal
    Information. When acting as a provider of Services to its Customers on
    Customer Sites, Parse.ly endeavors only to process Personal Information that
    is relevant to its Services, and for purposes compatible with those for which
    the Personal Information was collected; wherever possible, such Personal
    Information is non-identified.</p>

    <h2>ACCESSING AND CONTROLLING YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

    <p>EU data protection law (notably, <a href="https://www.privacytrust.com/gdpr/">GDPR</a>) makes a distinction
    between organizations that process Personal Information for their own
    purposes (known as "controllers") and organizations that process personal
    data on behalf of other organizations (known as "processors"). If you have
    a question or complaint about how your Personal Information is handled,
    these should always be directed to the relevant controller, since the
    controller has primary responsibility for your Personal Information.</p>

    <p>(For Visitors
    to Customer Sites) When Parse.ly acts as a provider of Services to its
    Customers on Customer Sites, we are a processor in respect of Personal
    Information about Visitors to Customer Sites that Customers provide us. We
    have no direct relationship with Visitors to Customer Sites, and any such
    Visitors who seek access, or who seek to correct, amend, or delete their
    Personal Information should direct their inquiries to the relevant Customer
    which has transferred such Personal Information to Parse.ly for processing. We
    will assist our Customers in fulfilling their obligations under applicable law
    to respond to such requests by individuals to access or correct, amend, or
    delete their Personal Information.
    </p>

    <p>(For Visitors
    to Our Site) We are a data controller in respect of Personal Information that
    Customers provide us as part of their accounts and Visitors provide us when
    visiting our Site. Under laws in certain countries in which Parse.ly operates,
    Customers who manage their accounts through our Service and Visitors to our
    Site from those countries have a right to access Personal Information about
    themselves, and to amend, correct, or delete Personal Information that is
    inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated. Parse.ly will, upon request, provide you
    with confirmation regarding whether Parse.ly is processing Personal
    Information about you, consistent with applicable law. In addition, upon your
    request, Parse.ly will take reasonable steps to correct, amend, or delete your
    Personal Information that is found to be inaccurate, incomplete or processed
    in a manner non-compliant with this Privacy Policy or applicable law, except
    where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to
    the risks to your privacy, where the rights of persons other than you would be
    violated or where doing so is otherwise consistent with applicable law. Unless
    prohibited by applicable law, Parse.ly reserves the right to charge a
    reasonable fee to cover costs for providing copies of Personal Information
    that you request.</p>

    <p>Please note
    that while any amendments, corrections, or deletions will be reflected in
    active user databases (as updated within a reasonable period of time),
    Parse.ly may retain all Personal Information for backups, archiving,
    prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, and satisfaction of other legal
    obligations we reasonably believe applicable.</p>

    <p>If you are
    accessing the Services on behalf of a Customer, you may review and/or change
    certain of your Personal Information by logging into the Site and accessing
    the Customer's Account. We may limit the Personal Information you can change
    on the Site. You authorize us to use and disclose any new or modified
    information that you provide in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and you
    agree that we are under no obligation to delete or modify information that you
    have previously chosen to provide us as to which you have not instructed us to
    take such action. Please remember, however, if we have already disclosed some
    of your Personal Information to third parties, we cannot access that Personal
    Information any longer and cannot force the deletion or modification of any
    such information by the parties to whom we have made those disclosures.</p>

    <p>Upon your
    request, we will close your Account as soon as reasonably possible, in
    accordance with applicable law. We may continue to use your Personal
    Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy even after we have closed
    your account, except that we will not display it on the Site or through the
    Services in a manner that personally identifies you. In addition, we may
    retain your Personal Information to comply with laws, prevent fraud, resolve
    disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our
    Terms, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.</p>

    <h3>Complaint Resolution</h3>

    <p>If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of
    your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, you can
    also submit your comments, complaints, or questions to Privacy Trust, an
    independent third party.
    Visit https://www.privacytrust.com/drs/parsely
    (or <a href="https://www.privacytrust.com/drs/parsely">click here</a>) to
    file a complaint. Finally, as a
    last resort and in limited situations, EU individuals may seek redress from
    the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism. If you are unhappy
    with how we deal with your complaint, or the outcome, you may invoke binding
    arbitration or refer your complaint to a data panel.</p>

    <h2>RECOURSE, ENFORCEMENT, AND LIABILITY</h2>

    <p>Parse.ly
    encourages you to raise questions about our processing or disclosure of your
    Personal Information by contacting us, as set forth in the "Contact Us"
    section below.</p>

    <p>Parse.ly will
    undertake reasonable efforts to investigate and attempt to resolve complaints
    and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Information in
    accordance with the principles contained in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>In addition,
    Parse.ly has agreed to cooperate with the American Arbitration Association
    ("<b>AAA</b>") with respect to complaints regarding use and disclosure of
    Personal Information and with the local data protection authorities with
    respect to personnel and human resources related information consistent with
    applicable law. For more information and to submit a complaint to AAA,
    visit http://go.adr.org/privacyshieldannex.html (or,
    <a href="http://go.adr.org/privacyshieldannex.html">click here</a>). Such
    independent dispute
    resolution mechanisms are available to Individuals free of charge.</p>

    <p>Any of our
    personnel that we determine are in violation of this Privacy Policy will be
    subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment,
    where applicable.</p>

    <h2>USE OF THIRD PARTY ANALYTICS</h2>

    <p>Parse.ly also
    uses analytics services provided by third parties, including, but not limited
    to, Google Analytics, Marketo, MixPanel, NewRelic, Intercom, and Wistia. These
    services use cookies to collect non-personally identifying information about
    details from Visitors of our Site and Services, including IP addresses, domain
    names, browser, device type, access times, the web pages you view, and other
    tracked user actions. These third party analytics services provide us with
    reports based on this information in order to help us improve the quality of
    the Site and Services.</p>

    <h2>FEEDBACK</h2>

    <p>If you
    provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any purpose,
    provided we do not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. We
    will collect any information contained in such feedback and will treat
    Personal Information therein in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>THIRD PARTIES NOT GOVERNED BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

    <p>This Privacy
    Policy addresses only Parse.ly's use and disclosure of information we collect
    from or about Visitors to our Site or to Customer Sites integrating the
    Parse.ly Analytics Service, or acting on behalf of a Customer as part of the
    registration process. The use and disclosure restrictions contained in this
    Privacy Policy do not apply to any third party and we do not control the
    privacy policies of third parties. If you disclose information to others,
    including to Visitors, you are subject to the privacy policies of those third
    parties where applicable.</p>

    <p>The Site may
    contain links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us. When
    you click on such a link, you will leave our Site and go to another site.
    During this process, another entity may collect Personal Information from you.
    We have no control over, do not review, and are not responsible for the
    privacy policies of or content displayed on such other websites.</p>

    Policy is subject to revision from time to time on a going-forward basis. We
    will post any revised version of the Privacy Policy on this page. If we make
    any material changes to it, we may also send you notice thereof to the last
    email address you have provided to us. Continued use of our Services following

    agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.</p>
