      <h1>Paramount Communication Group, Inc. <br> 
        <strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
      <p>This statement is effective as of 1/2/03. For the most current version of the Paramount Communication Group, Inc. Privacy Statement, please visit <a href="www.ParamountCommunication.com">www.ParamountCommunication.com</a></p>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p> At Paramount, we respect the privacy needs of our valued customers and members. This Privacy Policy outlines what specific information is gathered on the Paramount site and how that information is used.</p>
      <p>Paramount works to ensure highest degree of protection for consumers and businesses. In fact, our standards meet (and exceed) the U.S. Department of Commerce's "Safe Harbors" standards. We will continue to work to ensure that our website complies with strict standards for online privacy, security, business practices, transaction integrity and availability. If you have any specific questions about the Paramount Privacy Statement, please contact us via email at <a href="mailto:privacy@ParamountCommunication.com">privacy@ParamountCommunication.com</a></p>
      <h2>Collection and Use of Information by Paramount Communication Group</h2>
      <p> Paramount explicitly asks when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Your personal information is used to create your personal access to products on the site, and to contact you in the course of using the products. Financial information that is collected is used to verify identity, and to bill either you or your company for products and services, as applicable. Demographic and profile data collected by Paramount may be used to tailor the Website or any requested email communications, and to display information that is more relevant to you. Paramount also compiles demographic and product use information, but in the aggregate only. <strong>Under no circumstances will Paramount make any personal information about an individual user available to anyone.</strong></p>
      <p>Your email address is used to only send you information that you have requested. As part of your use of any Paramount product, Paramount allows you to elect to receive, or not receive, certain information from Paramount. Paramount adheres strictly to permission-based email policy. <strong>Paramount will not send you unsolicited email information, commercial offers or advertisements. Paramount will not sell, rent, or loan our contact lists or our customer's contact lists (including customer data) to any outside firms nor will Paramount use customer contact lists for our own marketing purposes.</strong> All emails that you have requested will have an option to unsubscribe. Unsubscribe requests are fulfilled within minutes and no further communications will be sent to users who have stated that they do not wish to receive the specified information. All Paramount partners who offer you information via email from our Website must adhere to this unsubscribe policy.</p>
      <p>While IP addresses (address of a computer) are logged to track a user's session, the user's identity is anonymous. Tracking IP addresses gives Paramount information about which parts of our site are used most often and what information is viewed. IP addresses are not linked to anything that can personally identify a visitor. Thus, session details are tracked, but the user is anonymous.</p>
      <h2>Information Use by Third Parties</h2>
      <p> It is Paramount policy to never provide your personal information to third parties without your express permission or only in instances where such disclosure is necessary to process payment transactions or provide services that you have requested. We do not release personal information about you as an individual. There are two exceptions to this policy. One - if Paramount is compelled to do so by an appropriately empowered governmental authority. Two - if Paramount makes the Paramount technology or services available to you through its business partners. Paramount will not share with them any more information than is necessary to perform the transaction you have requested. Where you have purchased our services through a Paramount partner, we may provide customer name and business volume information to the partner. Such partners have agreed to use the information only in regard to analyzing the success of the partnership arrangement. Paramount only does business with partners who agree to respect our Privacy Policy.</p>
      <h2>Contact Lists, Campaign Content and Campaign Reports</h2>
      <p> Paramount ensures that all contact lists, email content and reports remain private and confidential. Any use of Paramount systems must be in compliance with our Acceptable Use Policy - to protect against inappropriate use (illegal, abusive, obscene, threatening, etc.).</p>
      <p><strong>Paramount will not sell, rent, loan or allow external access to a customer's contact lists. </strong>Nor will Paramount themselves use customer's contact lists for any purpose.</p>
      <h2>Information Exchanges and Transactions</h2>
      <p> Privacy, anti-hacking and other security technology has been implemented throughout our application system. Information exchanges and transactions, passwords, contact lists (uploading and storing online) and billing related data between you and our application system are protected using various technologies (multiple PIX firewalls, etc.). This ensures a very high degree of security.</p>
      <h2>Credit Card Information</h2>
      <p> Paramount allows you to purchase email marketing services in a variety of ways. When credit card billing is chosen, information is transferred to Paramount Clearing House Partner using industry-leading, secure transmission technology including SSL and HTTPS (the transmission standard used for transactions by major financial institutions). The information is then encrypted using Data Encryption and stored securely so that it is ready to handle your transactions.</p>
      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p> Maintaining the privacy of your information is of paramount importance to us as it helps foster confidence, goodwill and stronger relationships with you, our customers. If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please feel free contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ParamountCommunication.com">privacy@ParamountCommunication.com</a>.</p>
