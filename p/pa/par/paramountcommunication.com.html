          by Paramount may be used to tailor the Website or any requested email

          not linked to anything that can personally identify a visitor. Thus,

          have requested. We do not release personal information about you as 
          an individual. There are two exceptions to this policy. One - if Paramount 
          is compelled to do so by an appropriately empowered governmental authority. 
          Two - if Paramount makes the Paramount technology or services available 
          to you through its business partners. Paramount will not share with 
          them any more information than is necessary to perform the transaction 
          you have requested. Where you have purchased our services through a 
          Paramount partner, we may provide customer name and business volume 
          information to the partner. Such partners have agreed to use the information 
          only in regard to analyzing the success of the partnership arrangement. 
          Paramount only does business with partners who agree to respect our 
          Privacy Policy. </font></p>
