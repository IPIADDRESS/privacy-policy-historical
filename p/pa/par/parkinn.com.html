<h1>Mobile Applications</h1>

<p>In order to assist our guests in booking, planning and enjoying their stay, we offer mobile applications for our different hotel brands including but not limited to Radisson Blu, Radisson RED, Radisson Rewards, and Park Inn. These mobile apps can be downloaded through online app stores, including the Apple App Store or the Google Play store.</p>

<p>Depending on how you use our mobile applications, your Personal Data may be processed for the purposes of (i) enabling you to reserve a room in the hotel of your choice (see also <a href="#booking" title="Hotel booking process">Hotel Booking Process</a>); (ii) processing your online check-in; (iii) managing your room service order; (iv) booking reservations at your request at a local restaurant; (v) performing special services at your request such as wake up calls, late check-out, or turn down service; (vi) enabling you to book meetings and events in our hotels; (vii) processing your online check-out and your feedback on your stay; (viii) addressing the requests you have made through the mobile app, including through the chat; and (ix) view how many loyalty points you have collected.</p>

<p>To avoid having us receive or use your real-time location, do not opt in to location services. If you did opt in and have changed your mind, you may opt out of location services through your device settings or by deleting the application. Equally, if you would like to no longer receive push notifications via one of our mobile applications, you can revoke push notification permission for the mobile application(s) in your device’s operating system settings.</p>

<p>The information below describes the types of data we process in the context of our mobile applications, where we get your data from, the ground we rely on to carry out the processing, and who we may share your data with. For the Radisson Rewards mobile application, please consult the dedicated section on <a href="#rewards" title="Radisson Rewards">Radisson Rewards</a><em>.</em></p>

<p><strong>iBeacon </strong>iBeacons are electronic devices that broadcast signals that can be received by mobile devices on which one of our mobile apps is installed. If you have voluntarily installed one of our apps on your device, and if you have granted permission for the app to track your location, then iBeacons installed in our hotels may send a signal to the app on your device about the precise, real-time location of the device. The app may use this information to deliver special offers and promotions to you, at a time and place when the information is most relevant. For example, if you are in one of our hotels late in the afternoon, your mobile device may receive a signal from an iBeacon that causes the app to notify you about drink or dinner specials. As a convenience to you, receipt of the iBeacons signal and delivery of the special offer or promotion may occur even if you are not currently using the app. To make our mobile apps and services operate better, we may also collect other information based on iBeacon signals, for example, the strength of the signal between the iBeacon and your device, the duration your device is near the iBeacon, or the battery level of the iBeacon itself. To avoid having us receive or use your precise, real-time location, do not opt in to location services. If you did opt in and have changed your mind, you may opt out of location services through your device settings or by deleting the app.</p>
