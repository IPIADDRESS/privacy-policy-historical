information. We have created this Privacy Policy to let you know what
information we collect when you use our services at our online sites
(collectively, the “Service”), why we collect this information and how we use
the collected information.</p>
                <p>We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy and will notify you
of these changes by posting the modified terms on our online site. We recommend
that you revisit this Privacy Policy regularly.</p>

as: contact information (including telephone number), shipping information,
billing information, transaction history, website usage preferences, and
feedback regarding the Service. This information is held by us on servers based
in Gibraltar and Canada and elsewhere from time to time. In addition, when you
interact with the Service, our servers keep an activity log unique to you that
collects certain administrative and traffic information including: source IP
address, time of access, date of access, web page(s) visited, language use,
software crash reports and type of browser used. This information is essential
for the provision of and the quality of the Service. We do not collect Personal
Information about you on the Service without your knowledge.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>2. Means of Collecting and Processing Data</strong>. We may
automatically collect certain data as discussed above and receive Personal
Information about you where you provide such information through the Service or
other communications and interactions with PartyGaming. We may also receive
Personal Information from online vendors and service providers that refer you
to the PartyGaming site, and from customer lists lawfully acquired from
third-party vendors. In addition, we may engage the services of third-party
service providers to provide technical support, process your online
transactions and maintain your online account. We will have access to any
information you provide to such vendors, service providers and third-party
e-commerce services, and we will use the Personal Information as set out in
section 3 below. This information may be disclosed only to our staff and to
third parties involved in the completion of your transactions or in support of
your use of the Service as set out in section 3 below. We take steps to ensure
that our arrangements with third-party service providers and online vendors
protect your privacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>3. Information Use</strong>. We use the Personal Information we
collect from you to deliver our Service, to provide customer support, to

other purpose related to the operation of the Service. Your Personal
Information may also be shared with our affiliates, subsidiaries, agents and
suppliers in order to provide the Service and provide you with promotional
offers and information regarding Group products and services and in order for
the Group to better provide a range of products and services and improved
customer service. From time-to-time, we may request information from you via

online poker, casino and bingo services) and relevant products and services
from selected third parties. We will not sell, lease or share your Personal
Information except as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>4. Certain Excluded Disclosures</strong>. We may disclose your
Personal Information if required to do so by law, or if we believe in good
faith that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with any legal process
served on us, any PartyGaming sites or the Service; (2) protect and defend our
rights or property; or (3) act to protect the personal safety of users of the
Service or the public. If, in our sole determination, you are found to have

communications either by choosing to opt out where such option is made
available on the PartyGaming sites or the Service or in an email you receive
from us, or at any time by sending an <a href="mailto:privacy@partygaming.com" onclick="s_objectID=&quot;www.partycasino.commailto:privacy@partygaming.com_1&quot;;if(this.s_oc)return this.s_oc(e);return true">email</a>, or by writing to us at

                    <strong>7. Consent to Use of Electronic Service Providers</strong>. In order
to play real money games on the Service, you will be required to send money to
and receive money from us. We may use third party electronic payment processors
and/or financial institutions ("ESPs") to process such financial
transactions. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you consent to Personal
Information necessary for the processing of transactions being shared with
ESPs, including where necessary the transfer of information outside of your
country. We take steps to ensure that our arrangements with ESPs protect your
privacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>8. Consent to Security Review</strong>. We reserve the right to
conduct a security review at any time to validate your identity, age, the
registration data provided by you and to verify your use of the Service and
your financial transactions for potential breach of our <a href="/about_us/legal.html" onclick="s_objectID=&quot;www.partycasino.com/about_us/legal.html_1&quot;;if(this.s_oc)return this.s_oc(e);return true">Terms and Conditions of Use</a> and of applicable
law. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you authorise us, our staff, affiliates,
subsidiaries, agents and suppliers to use your Personal Information and to
disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purposes of
validating the information you provide to us in the course of using the
Services, including, where necessary, the transfer of information outside of
your country. Security reviews may include but are not limited to ordering a
credit report and/or otherwise verifying the information you provide against
third-party databases. In addition, to facilitate these security reviews, you
agree to provide such information or documentation as we may request.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>9. Consent to Use of Anti-Cheating Software</strong>. Our software
package - used to access and use the Service - contains certain features
designed to detect use of automated programs that enable artificial (non-human)
intelligence to play on our site. Use of such 'bot' software programs violates
our <a href="/about_us/legal.html" onclick="s_objectID=&quot;www.partycasino.com/about_us/legal.html_2&quot;;if(this.s_oc)return this.s_oc(e);return true">Terms and Conditions</a>, where we deem it
detrimental to other players. By installing our software and using the Service,
you consent to our software performing the functions described in this section.
Our software may perform any or all of the following functions in order to
detect the use of illicit automated programs and ensure that we maintain a
'cheat free' environment for all users: (1) scan your list of active software
applications while you are using the Service; (2) scan your list of active
processes while you are using the service; and (3) scan the files in your
PartyGaming site-related program folders to ensure that only 'non-hacked'
versions of our software are being used. If any of the foregoing processes
reveals a suspect application or process, our software may scan the files
associated with the suspect application or process and compile a composite mesh
(i.e., a profile that characterizes the files associated with the application
or process) to be matched against profiles for known illicit automated
programs. Our software will not perform any random search of large portions of
your hard drive, equipment or files, and it will not transmit any information
to us or to any third party other than the information necessary to identify
use of illicit automated programs as described above. Our software will not
alter any files or information on your computer or other equipment and will not
interfere with the operation of any of your applications. You may terminate use
of our software at any time by uninstalling the PartyGaming software
package.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>10. Security</strong>. We understand the importance of information
security and the techniques needed to secure information. We store all of the
Personal Information we receive directly from you in a password-protected
database residing within our secure network behind active state-of-the-art
firewall software. PartyGaming online sites and the Service support SSL Version
3 with 128-bit encryption. We take steps to ensure our subsidiaries, agents,
affiliates and suppliers also employ adequate levels of security.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>11. Protection of Children</strong>. The Service is not intended for
or directed at persons under the age of 18 (or the lawful age in their
respective jurisdiction). Any person who provides their information to us
through any part of the Service represents to us that they are 18 years of age
(or the lawful age in their respective jurisdiction) or older. It is our policy
to endorse the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and to use our
best efforts to comply with that Act. This may involve us having to access and
verify your Personal Information. If we become aware that a minor has attempted
to or has submitted personal information via the online site, we will not
accept this information and will take steps to remove such information from our
records.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>12. International Transfers</strong>. Personal Information collected
on the Service may be stored and processed in any country in which we or our
affiliates, suppliers, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities. By using the
Service, you consent to any transfer of information outside of your country
(including to third countries that may not have been assessed as having
adequate privacy laws). Nevertheless, we take steps to ensure that our
subsidiaries, agents, affiliates and suppliers comply with our standards of
privacy regardless of their location.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>13. Third-Party Practices</strong>. We cannot ensure the protection
of any information or images that you provide to a third-party online site that
links to or from the PartyGaming sites or any information collected by any
third party administering our affiliate program or any other program, since
these third-party online sites are owned and operated independently of us. Any
information collected by these third parties is not governed by this Privacy
Policy but by the privacy policy, if any, of such third party. If you have
questions about a third party’s information practices, please read its privacy
policy. We assume no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the practices,
actions or policies of such third parties, and we are not responsible for the
content or privacy practices of such online sites.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>14. Legal Disclaimer</strong>. The Service operates 'AS-IS' and
'AS-AVAILABLE,' without liability of any kind. We are not responsible for
events beyond our direct control. Because of the complex and constantly
changing nature of our technology and business, we cannot guarantee nor do we
represent that there will be error-free performance regarding the privacy of
your Personal Information, and we will not be liable for any indirect,
incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to the use or release of
Personal Information.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>15. Merger</strong>. If we should ever file for bankruptcy or be
acquired by a third party, merge with a third party, sell all or part of our
assets, or otherwise transfer substantially all of our relevant assets to a
third party, we are entitled to share the Personal Information and all other
information you have provided through the Service to potential and subsequent
business and merger partners.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>16. Consent to Privacy Policy</strong>. By clicking ‘Submit’ or ‘I
agree’ during the registration process or by your continued use of the Service
following the posting of this Privacy Policy (as applicable), you agree to this
Privacy Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it
supersedes any earlier version. This Privacy Policy should be read in
