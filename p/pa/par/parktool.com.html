<p><strong>The Data We Collect</strong>
  </p>
<p>In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. However, we collect your computer’s or mobile device’s IP address, which you necessarily disclose when you visit the Site, so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to your computer or device. The Site utilizes "cookies," which are text files placed on your computer that web pages on the Site may use to store data on your computer or send data to our web server. We may use cookie data to "recognize" you when you visit the Site in the future, to troubleshoot how the Site operates, and for internal analysis of how people use the Site. Should you decide not to accept cookies from the Site, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit and use the Site. We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of the Site.   </p>
<p>When you engage in certain activities on the Site, such as signing up to receive our newsletter, purchasing products on the Site (where permitted under our policies), or providing feedback on the Site or in connection with the receipt of our newsletter or in relation to the purchase or use of our products and services, we may ask you to provide personal and other information. In order to engage in such activities you will be required to provide information that lets us know the specifics of who you are, such as your first name, last name, mailing address, zip or postal code, e-mail address, credit card, and other information. If such information is required to provide services to you or where it is optional for you to engage in these activities, if you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you may not be able to engage in that activity, we may not be able to assist you in connection with our products or services or fulfill the purpose for which you contacted us, or you may limit your ability to use all or a portion of the Site.   </p>
<p><strong>Use of the Data We Collect</strong>
  </p>
<p>We use personal information to provide and improve our products and services, including the Site, for purposes in our legitimate interests and for compliance with applicable laws.
  </p>
<p>We process personal information on the basis that it is: (a) necessary for the performance of a contract we have with you; (b) in our or a third parties’ legitimate interests such as a contract with your employer under which we are required to deliver products or services; (c) where you give us your consent; or (d) for compliance with a legal obligation.
  </p>
<p>We may use your IP address to: (a) help diagnose problems with the Site, administer and improve the Site, and measure the use of the Site; (b) identify the type of web browsers used, the pages viewed, the web sites from which a visitor found this Site, and the search terms and search engines used to find this Site; and (c) gather other web analytics information relating to visitors’ use and navigation of the Site. This information does not identify you personally. On occasion we may aggregate this data with data on the pages visited by other users to track overall visitor traffic patterns and provide this aggregate information to vendors, business partners, or affiliates.
  </p>
<p>The information we obtain using standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, enables us to customize the services we offer visitors to our Site, to deliver targeted content and advertisements, and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online content, advertising, or programming.
  </p>
<p>We may use your personal information for particular activities, including, without limitation, customer service, credit card processing, processing your order, collections, marketing and research, developing and displaying content and advertising tailored to your interests, providing product, promotional and other information to you, and to contact you regarding administrative notices. We may share this information with distributors, marketing partners, and advertisers, with whom we collaborate. We must release your credit card information to credit card authorization service providers and associated banks to process your payments for products or services purchased on this Site. In addition, if we use service providers, these service providers may have access to your personal information to perform contractually specified services on our behalf.
  </p>
<p>We may always use the information you provide in an anonymous or aggregated format that does not identify you personally, which uses might include, without limitation, to evaluate existing products, services, and systems; to assist in the development of new products or services; research; advertising; and to identify trends and changes.
  </p>
<p>We may disclose personal information in any of the following circumstances: (a) in response to a subpoena, search warrant, court order, or other legal process or request, or as may otherwise be required by law, rule, or regulation; (b) to protect and defend our rights or property or those of its affiliates or business partners, or others; or (c) as we, in our sole discretion, believe is appropriate under exigent circumstances in response to a perceived threat to the personal safety, property, or rights of any person or organization.
  </p>
<p>In addition, since our database is a business asset, in the event we are reorganized or become part of another organization, you consent to the sale, assignment, or transfer of your personal information to a successor that acquires substantially all of our business assets, or to an affiliate, as applicable.
  </p>

<p>The easiest way to stop receiving our newsletter is to click “unsubscribe” on the bottom of the newsletter email.
