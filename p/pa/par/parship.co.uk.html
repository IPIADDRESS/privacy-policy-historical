<p class="ps_standardText">
<b>1. Security and Anonymity</b>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
Security is of the highest importance to PARSHIP and TÜV SÜD has confirmed that we meet high standards when it comes to security. PARSHIP undertakes all efforts to protect the data that is entrusted to it by its customers from unauthorised access. With the help of sophisticated systems of authorised access and technical protective measures like SSL-encryption and firewalls, the maximum data security is sought. The data in your PARSHIP profile visible to other users is only linked to your anonymous cipher. Establishing contact with others is done via an internal mailbox. The names and email addresses of the customers are kept secret at all times. Accordingly, the customer’s identity remains protected and the customers themselves decide if and when they disclose their identity to other members.

For this targeted advertising PARSHIP uses parts of the customer data in order to decide whether a particular advertisement should be displayed. The choice of target groups takes place anonymously. When advertisers choose the target groups of their advertising based on demographic data, PARSHIP automatically uses the advertisements relevant to the corresponding audience. PARSHIP’s advertisers will only receive anonymous reports from which reference to an individual cannot be made.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">

</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
<b>3.6 Use of Cookies</b>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
PARSHIP uses so-called cookies in order to design and optimise the individual experience and time spent online. A cookie is a text file that is stored on the hard disk of the computer either temporarily ("session" cookie) or for a longer pre-defined period of time ("persistent" cookie). Cookies contain, for example, information about the previous hits of the user on the relevant server and which offers have been accessed up to now. Cookies are not used to run programs or load viruses to your computer. The main purpose of cookies is to provide specially tailored offers to the customers and make using the service as convenient as possible.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
PARSHIP uses session cookies, partner and affiliate cookies, and persistent cookies.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
(1) Session cookies
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
PARSHIP primarily uses "session cookies", which are temporarily stored on the customer’s hard disk and automatically deleted when the browser is closed. Session cookies are used for login authentication and load balancing (balancing the system load).
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
(2) Partner and affiliate cookies
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
PARSHIP continues to use cookies where a customer accesses external advertising space from the PARSHIP service. These cookies are used to settle accounts with commercial partners and contain no personal data of the customer. They are automatically deleted when the customer logs on to a website or after the expiry of four weeks.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
(3) Persistent cookies
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
PARSHIP uses so-called "persistent" cookies to store the personal usage settings entered by a customer when using PARSHIP services for the purpose of personalising and improving the PARSHIP services. Persistent cookies are used to ensure that the customer’s personal settings can be applied each time the customer visits the website. Persistent cookies are also used to automatically distinguish which membership status the customer has, whether they have already seen particular information and advertisements or participated in a survey. In addition, the service providers that PARSHIP has engaged to analyse user behaviour use persistent cookies for the purpose of identifying repeat users. These services only store the data transferred from the cookies anonymously. References to the IP address of a customer are not kept.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
(4) Partner sites / Advertisers
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">

PARSHIP has no control over and is not responsible for the actions of these partners. PARSHIP recommends that you read the privacy policy of the respective commercial partner.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
(5) Preventing Cookies

<p class="ps_standardText">
The customer may at any time disable cookies. This is usually done by selecting the appropriate option in the browser settings or through other programs. For more information see the browser’s help faction. If the customer decides to disable the cookies, this can reduce the scope of services available and have a negative impact on the use of the PARSHIP service. To the opt-out procedure.

The plugins are identifiable by a Facebook logo (white letter f on blue background or a thumb up icon) or the notice “Facebook Social Plugin”. For a full list of all social Plugins please see http://developers.facebook.com/plugins.
</p>

<b>3.8 Information about stored data</b>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
The customer may at any time request information about the data that has been stored about his or her person, its origin, the purpose for which it is stored and the recipient to whom the data will be given. This information is free and will be given in writing.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
The request shall be in writing and signed by the customer. The request shall be addressed to PARSHIP GmbH, – Customer Service United Kingdom –, Speersort 10, 20095 Hamburg, Germany. The request must also contain the following information:
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
(1.) the email address provided to PARSHIP, username or cipher<br>
(2.) Service password
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
<b>3.9 Deleting and correcting data</b>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
The customer has the statutory right to request at any time that data stored by PARSHIP about him or her be deleted or corrected.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
The customer may send such a request in an email containing the following information:
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
(1.) the email address provided to PARSHIP, username or cipher <br>
(2.) service password
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
The email shall be sent to support@parship.co.uk. The customer may also send the request via Fax to 040 - 46 00 26 - 596 or in writing to PARSHIP GmbH, - Customer Service United Kingdom -, Speersort 10, 20095 Hamburg, Germany.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
<b>3.10 Verifying personal data</b>
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
To prevent people from misusing the PARSHIP service (sometimes with fraudulent intent), PARSHIP, without having a legal duty to do so, uses different automated monitoring tools to analyse the random activities on the platform and check the plausibility of customer input.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
Further, PARSHIP carries out – also without any legal obligation to do so – automated, random filtering of messages. Accordingly, customers’ written texts can be checked against word lists to make sure they comply with applicable laws and the general terms and conditions. For example, words of a pornographic or clearly offensive nature can be automatically matched to a customer’s text. As part of the so-called anti-scamming scans, customers are sought to be protected from scams.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
Should a random / automated audit result in suspected abuse of the PARSHIP service, the legal consequences with respect to the membership are set out in paragraph 7 of the general terms and conditions. PARSHIP may also refuse to accept or deliver incoming and outgoing messages where the automated screening process suggests there is a high probability that the relevant message is unlawful and / or violates the general terms and conditions. Messages already sent will be placed in a separate "spam folder" and deleted after 90 days. The customer will not receive any notification that the message was deleted or not delivered.
</p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
<b>4. Current state of technology</b></p>
<p class="ps_standardText">
The customer is aware that, based on the current state of technology, data security cannot be guaranteed during the transfer of data over the internet. In particular, emails do not provide secure communication, because "eavesdropping" cannot technically be prevented. The customer is responsible for the security of their own data transmitted by them over the internet.</p>
