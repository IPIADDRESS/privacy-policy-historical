We have created this Privacy Policy to let you know what information We collect when you use Our services at Our online sites (collectively, the '<strong>Service</strong>'), why We collect this information and how We use the collected information.</p>
        <p><p>Please note that this Privacy Policy will be agreed between you and the PartyGaming Group being PartyGaming PLC together with any subsidiaries of PartyGaming PLC from time to time including, but not limited to those companies forming party of the Group as defined in the <a href="https://secure.partyaccount.com/about/legal_information_s.htm">Terms and Conditions of Use</a> ('<strong>PartyGaming</strong>','<strong>We</strong>', '<strong>Us</strong>' or '<strong>Our</strong>', as appropriate).</p></p>
        <p>We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy and will notify you of these changes by posting the modified terms on Our online site. We recommend that you revisit this Privacy Policy regularly.</p>
        <p><strong>2. INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong><br /><br /> We consider information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, first and last name, date of birth, credit card information, home or other physical address, email address, phone number or other contact information to be Personal Information ('<strong>Personal Information</strong>'). You may be asked to provide Personal Information when you use Our website, register for an account or to use the Service. The Personal Information that We collect may include information such as: contact information (including telephone number), shipping information, billing information, transaction history, website usage preferences, and feedback regarding the Service. This information is held by Us on servers based in Gibraltar, Alderney and Kahnawake and elsewhere from time to time. In addition, when you interact with the Service, Our servers keep an activity log unique to you that collects certain administrative and traffic information including: source IP address, time of access, date of access, web page(s) visited, language use, software crash reports and type of browser used. This information is essential for the provision and quality of the Service. We do not collect Personal Information about you on the Service without your knowledge. </p>
        <p><strong>3. MEANS OF COLLECTING AND PROCESSING DATA</strong><br /><br /> We may automatically collect certain data as discussed above and receive Personal Information about you where you provide such information through the Service or other communications and interactions with Us. We may also receive Personal Information from online vendors and service providers that refer you to the PartyGaming sites, and from customer lists lawfully acquired from third-party vendors. In addition, We may engage the services of third-party service providers to provide technical support, process your online transactions and maintain your online account. We will have access to any information you provide to such vendors, service providers and third-party e-commerce services, and We will use the Personal Information as set out in this Privacy Policy below. This information will only be disclosed to third parties outside the PartyGaming group in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We take steps to ensure that Our arrangements with third-party service providers and online vendors protect your privacy.</p>
        <p><strong>4. INFORMATION USE</strong><br /><br /> We use the Personal Information We collect from you to deliver Our Service, to provide customer support, to undertake necessary security and identify verification checks, to process any of your online transactions, meet certain business requirements and for any other purpose related to the operation of the Service. Your Personal Information may also be shared with Our affiliates, agents and suppliers in order to provide the Service and provide you with promotional offers and information regarding PartyGaming products and services and in order for PartyGaming to better provide a range of products and services and improved customer service. From time-to-time, We may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and, therefore, you have the choice of whether or not to disclose such information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name, correspondence address and telephone number), and demographic information (such as zip or postal code or age). If you choose to participate in a survey or contest and win, by accepting any contest prize or winnings from Us, you consent to use of your name and likeness for advertising and promotional purposes without additional compensation, except where prohibited by law. Unless you have elected not to receive promotional information, We may also use your Personal Information (including your email address and phone number) to provide you with information regarding PartyGaming's products, services and promotions, including other gaming products (including online poker, casino and bingo services) and products and services from third parties carefully selected by Us. </p>
        <p><strong>5.

        <p><strong>10. CONSENT TO USE OF ANTI-CHEATING SOFTWARE</strong><br /><br /> Our software package - used to access and use the Service - contains certain features designed to detect use of automated programs that enable artificial (non-human) intelligence to play on Our site. Use of such 'bot' software programs violates Our <a href="/about/legal_information_s.htm">Terms and Conditions</a>, where We deem it detrimental to other players. By installing Our software and using the Service, you consent to Our software performing the functions described in this section.

Our software will not perform any random search of large portions of your hard drive, equipment or files, and it will not transmit any information to Us or to any third party other than the information necessary to identify use of illicit automated programs as described above. Our software will not alter any files or information on your computer or other equipment and will not interfere with the operation of any of your applications.

We take steps to ensure Our subsidiaries, agents, affiliates and suppliers also employ adequate levels of security. </p>
        <p><strong>12. PROTECTION OF CHILDREN</strong><br /><br /> The Service is not intended for or directed at persons under the age of 18 (or the lawful age in their respective jurisdiction).

We may also receive Personal Information from online vendors and service providers that refer you to the PartyGaming sites, and from customer lists lawfully acquired from third-party vendors.
