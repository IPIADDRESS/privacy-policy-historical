<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p class="first">ParetoLogic, Inc. ("ParetoLogic") is committed to protecting the privacy of personal information you may provide to us when using any of our online services. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat information we receive when you transmit data to ParetoLogic.

We also give users the option of receiving useful product information (such as updates, pest alerts and associated product offerings), via opt-in permission based email.
