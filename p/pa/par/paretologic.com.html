<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p class="first">ParetoLogic, Inc. ("ParetoLogic") is committed to protecting the privacy of personal information you may provide to us when using any of our online services. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat information we receive when you transmit data to ParetoLogic.
</p>

<h2>Information Collection</h2>
When you purchase, download trial or evaluation versions, or register ParetoLogic software, we may collect personal information including your name, address, email address, etc. for the purpose of recording the transaction when you engage in activities on our web site or within the Paretologic software. When we use a payment processing merchant we ensure that the same strict privacy criteria are in place. We do not (knowingly) collect personal information from persons under the age of eighteen. We also give users the option of receiving useful product information (such as updates, pest alerts and associated product offerings), via opt-in permission based email. We fully ensure your privacy and value your trust. We will never sell, rent, lease or trade your personal information to any third party. Likewise, your information will not be shared with a third party in any other way unless ParetoLogic is required to do so by law. ParetoLogic may engage the services of a third party from time to time and may provide certain information that includes personal information in order for the third party to perform such services. Any third parties who provide services to ParetoLogic have agreed not to disclose your information or use it for any other purpose, and are required to implement or adopt a Privacy Policy that is no less stringent than ParetoLogic's Privacy Policy. You may opt out of receiving emails from us at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email or by visiting our website at <a href="/" alt="www.paretologic.com" title="www.paretologic.com">www.paretologic.com</a>.

<br><br>
Any information that you post to a chat room, public bulletin or forum is available to all users of that site. Paretologic cannot control, nor is it responsible for the use, disclosure, or dissemination of such information by any third parties.
<p></p>

We may automatically collect IP addresses and Web site usage information when you access our online services. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors navigate our sites on an aggregate basis, including but not limited to the number and frequency of visitors, length of visits, etc. 
<p></p>

This information enables us to deliver faster service capabilities to our customers or to our affiliates and/or other sales partners, prevent denial of service attacks on our systems, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions, and assist with awarding proper sales credit to our partners. All ParetoLogic cookies are 1) of limited duration, 2) less than 5KB in length, 3) only visible to ParetoLogic, and 4) devoid of any personally identifiable information.
