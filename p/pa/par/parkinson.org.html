  <p align="center"><b>NATIONAL PARKINSON FOUNDATION, INC. PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
  <p> National Parkinson Foundation, Inc, thanks you for visiting its Web site. 
    Because we are committed to respecting the privacy of our Web site visitors, 
    this Web site privacy policy statement and safeguarding describes the information 
    we collect from you during your visit to our site, how we may use it, and 
    how we will protect the information which you may opt to provide. </p>
  <p><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b> <br>
    Personally identifiable information includes your name, address, zip code 
    and telephone number, e-mail address or any other information which might 
    reasonably be used to identify you individually. NPF collects personally identifiable 
    information from Web site visitors only when it is voluntarily provided. NPF 
    will not otherwise collect this information from you on our Web site. NPF 
    offers the option of making tax deductible contribution to NPF and with a 
    credit card and will collect the information needed to make such transactions.</p>
  <p>At those portions of our Web site where we provide you with the option to 
    input personally identifiable information, we notify you of the uses we intend 
    to make of that information in any given instance. When NPF receives personally 
    identifiable information we may use it for reasonable purposes. For example 
    we may use this information to contact you, via e-mail or regular mail, to 
    provide you with information we believe may be of interest. It may also be 
    used for compiling data and analyses to understand and serve your needs. Data 
    is also compiled to evaluate the use and utility of the services we provide 
    on line. <b>Personally identifiable information will not be sold, rented or 
    exchanged outside of NPF unless the user is first notified and expressly consents 
    to such transfer.</b> </p>
  <p><b>Collective/Aggregate Data</b><br>
    NPF Web sites may also collect information from you that is not personally 
    identifiable. For example, we might track information about the date and time 
    visitors access our site, the type of web browser they used, and the Web sites 
    from which they connected to our site. Our Web sites collect this information 
    by depositing certain bits of information called "cookies" in a visitor's 
    computer. This technology does not collect an individual visitor's personally 
    identifiable information, rather this information is collected in an aggregate 
    form. The "cookies" can tell us how and when pages in a Web site were visited 
    and by how many people. This aggregate information will enable us to improve 
    our Web sites to serve and inform you better. It also may allow you to shortcut 
    accesses to point of interest on our Web sites when you reenter our system. 
    Attaching this device to your system has no effect on how it performs.</p>
  <p><b>Links To Other Sites</b><br>
    As a resource to our visitors NPF may provide links to other Web sites. We 
    try to carefully choose Web sites which we believe are useful and meet our 
    high standards for the accuracy and utility of information. However, because 
    Web site design and content can change so quickly we cannot guarantee the 
    standards of every Web site to which we link. Likewise, we are not responsible 
    for the content of any non NPF site. We also cannot guarantee the privacy 
    policies of these other sites and suggest you check the privacy policies of 
    those sites directly. </p>
  <p><b>Choice</b><br>
    If you wish to stop receiving any e-mail or other communications from NPF 
    which might be sent to you in the future based on your request for this information 
    or if you have submitted personally identifiable information through a NPF 
    Web site and would like to have that information deleted please notify us 
    and it will be done promptly.</p>
  <p> <b>Accuracy</b><br>
    NPF will make every effort to maintain the accuracy and confidentiality of 
    any personal information you supply to us. If you wish to make additions or 
    other corrections to the information you have sent in please transmit it to 
    the National Parkinson Foundation Inc.'s data processing department.</p>
  <p> <b>Security</b> <br>
    All information transmitted to this NPF Web site is secure to the extent possible 
    using existing technology. Unauthorized third parties should not be able to 
    access it during transmission. We will store the information that you share 
    with us securely and will take appropriate steps to protect it from unauthorized 
    access or disclosure. While no security steps can offer 100 percent protection 
    we utilize state-of-the-art technology and systems to prevent unauthorized 
    access to the information we hold. We will limit access to this information 
    to those NPF personnel with a need to know. We educate our staff about their 
    duty to protect your privacy and provide training regarding the policy described 
    herein. </p>
  <p><b>Changes</b><br>
    Any changes to this privacy policy will be communicated promptly at this location. 
    Please check our privacy page periodically to review any changes that may 
    have been made. </p>
  <p><b>Thank you for visiting the NPF Web site. WE value your interest and ideas. 
    If you have any comments or concerns regarding the use of information provided 
    by NPF via an Internet site please <a href="contact.htm">contact us</a>.</b>
