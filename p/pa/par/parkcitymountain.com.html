    <h2>
      Our Commitment To Privacy

    <p>
      Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and we will update it immediately if our policies change.
    </p>
    <h2>
      The Information We Collect:
    </h2>
    <p>
      This notice applies to information you supply to Park City Mountain Resort. The information may be provided via the Resort's websites or at various other locations including points of sale at the Resort. The types of personal information collected may include:

      Credit/Debit Card Information
      <br>
      (etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
      On some webpages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are:
    </p>
    <p>
      Name
      <br>
      Address
      <br>

      <br>
      (etc.)
    </p>
    <h2>
      The Way We Use Information:
    </h2>
    <p>
      We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product you order for another person. Information you provide to us to create a gift-card is only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving the gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can register on our website if you would like to receive marketing collateral as well as updates regarding resort events, news, snow conditions or terrain park information. Information you submit on other pages of our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose personally identifiable information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Park City Mountain Resort will never use, sell, rent or share the personally identifiable information provided to us to any third party for any reason, except for in certain special cases in which we may disclose your personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to you, or otherwise injuring or interfering with Park City Mountain Resort's rights, property or operations, other Park City Mountain Resort's site users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe the law requires it, or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case, administrative investigation or investigation conducted by Park City Mountain Resort. We shall have no obligation to inform you of our compliance with the law, including without limitation a response to a law enforcement request or a valid subpoena.
