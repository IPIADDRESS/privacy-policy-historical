Biracial and multiracial individuals are slowly becoming the majority, yet there are few resources addressing how to educate and parent them. We like to say that everyone is the same, however ignoring our differences rather than embracing them, doesn't allow children to grow up with a strong sense of self. In an effort to create this strong sense of self in my own children, I've compiled a list of things I've learned about raising biracial children:   1. Immediately people will question whether or not you are the mother. In some cases, biracial children carry more features from the father than the mother. In my case, both of my children are light skinned, so people assumed because I had brown skin that I couldn't possibly be the mother.   2. Your baby is like a box of chocolates, thanks to genes, you never know what you're going to get. When my oldest daughter was born, this shocked me. I expected that she would have a little bit of brown in her skin. I also forgot that I have some family members that are white, so the genes pulled from all directions.   3. Some government forms still don't have a place to mark for more than one race. Fortunately since the boxes are there, I check them anyway!   4. At some point, your child may identify with one race over another. This may not be yours and you may feel hurt. Biracial children build healthy self-concepts when they are taught that they are both, not 50/50. However, during adolescence, they may relate to one group over another due to common interests, or the fact that one group is nicer to them than another.   5. Finding hair care products may pose a challenge. Not only do the genes collide to form facial features and skin color, but also hair texture. Thankfully there are so many products to choose from, but it can feel overwhelming at times finding the right one. Several bloggers (including me) do product reviews on products that they love.  6. You will have to explain race to your child before the world starts to question them. This goes back to my point in #4. The earlier you can discuss with your child about how unique and special they are, the better. They will grow up with a healthy self-concept and realize that they don't have to choose one race over the other, but they are lucky enough to be a combination of two races/cultures/ethnicities.   7. You will love your child regardless. Regardless of how much of your gene pool is noticeable through physical characteristics or mannerisms, you will love your child. Biracial children need love and support just like any other child. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

At least, that's how it works in our family.    We didn't plan it that way... That's just how it worked out.  People are curious when it comes to adoption -- I get that. We're naturally curious about families that look different or are put together a little bit differently.  I've made my peace with the curiosity, although I don't do very well with the complete stranger asking me personal questions in the frozen food aisle (because shit always goes down in the frozen food aisle... who knows why, really?).  My family has learned to handle staring, assumptions, stereotypes and prejudice. We adopted our boys because we wanted to be parents. However, we have had to make an uneasy peace with our new role as the poster family for adoption.  I can handle the most intrusive questions with a fair amount of grace, but I am way nicer when I've had some chocolate or when I've been drinking. Aren't we all?  I have heard it all:  &quot;Why China and not an American kid?&quot;  &quot;Bless you, you're such a saint.&quot;  &quot;How much did your adoption cost?&quot;  Oh, and if you're that person who asked, &quot;How much did they cost?&quot;, like my kids are some sort of good deal at the farmers' market... best to take cover. You were warned.  That said, there is one word that raises my blood pressure and causes my inner crazy b*tch to skyrocket to the surface: REAL.  &quot;Are they real brothers?&quot;  &quot;What happened to their real parents?&quot;  I try not to get wrapped up in semantics. I know when people say &quot;real,&quot; they mean biological.  And the simple answers are:  No, my boys are not biologically related, and we have no idea what happened to their biological parents or why they chose not to parent these children. That knowledge isn't part of our adoption story, and even if it were, we wouldn't be sharing.  But think about what it means for my kids to hear you ask if they're &quot;real brothers.&quot; Stop and consider what they might think when people ask casual questions about their place in our family.  My kids share a room. They share toys.  They share parental attention.  Sometimes, they share punishment.  They are real brothers.  I comfort my children when they're scared. I sit up all night and worry when they're sick.  I laugh at them and with them.  They piss me off, make me feel old and keep me young.  I am their real mother.  You might think your questions are innocent. You probably don't think at all.  Maybe you thought my kids were cute and I accidentally smiled at you and opened the door for conversation and the &quot;real brothers&quot; question was the first thing that popped into your head.  My children love each other fiercely. Sometimes, this love is shown by teasing, punching, hair-pulling and messing with the other kid's stuff, but the love is there.  I don't love my adopted kids less or more than my kid that came into this world via my own hooha. You don't need to be connected by DNA to love, people.  And while I &quot;know what you mean&quot; when someone asks if my sons are real brothers, it's something I wish people wouldn't say because the after-effects can hurt my children.  My kids are usually standing right next to me, and they hear the questions people ask. Not a week goes by when we don't get asked a question about &quot;real brothers&quot; and &quot;real parents.&quot;  Constantly having my family's authenticity questioned, even in a benign and well-meaning way, wears on me and opens the door to questions at home that I'd rather let happen organically.  I hate that our adoption talks are usually sparked by something said by a stranger.  My kids are real.  My family is real.  And the &quot;you're a saint&quot; comment never ceases to make me laugh. I'll bet my Friday night wine-swilling cuss-fests would probably change a person's mind about that real quick.  I'll end with a tip: Use a boob job as a good frame of reference for nosy adoption questions, or any nosy questions. If you wouldn't walk up to me and ask me if my tatas were real, then maybe you shouldn't ask a similarly inappropriate question about my kids. I think that's pretty good advice.  You're welcome.

Around 6.3 million children under the age of 5 die every year, mostly of preventable causes, and mostly in underdeveloped countries. This is more than twice the total number of deaths in the United States annually. Eight hundred women die due to pregnancy and childbirth complications every day, according to facts released by the World Health Organization in 2014 -- and the developing world suffers 99 percent of these fatalities. But now, thanks to a number of innovative, elegantly low-tech solutions coupled with aggressive development goals coming out of the most recent United Nations General Assembly, the next few years could look radically different for families around the world.   The recent case of a 10-month-old Bangladeshi child afflicted with severe pneumonia offers one of many signals of change. A racing heartbeat, rapid breathing and a telltale gasping sound that often accompanies collapsing lungs are among pneumonia’s symptoms. In much of the developed world, this illness would be treated with the most advanced medical care. And luckily for this child, his parents were also able to obtain life-saving treatment -- by no means a guarantee in their region. They happened to arrive at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICDDR) in Dhaka, where a groundbreaking, low-cost oxygen therapy is being developed. Thanks to this deceptively simple device, the child made a full recovery from the type of severe pneumonia that claims 900,000 infants each year.   Chief among the U.N.’s 17 latest Sustainable Development Goals are health and well-being targets specifically aimed at improving outcomes for mothers and children: reducing maternal mortality rates around the world by over 60 percent and mortality rates for children under 5 by almost 50 percent. Getting there will require great cooperation, participation and technological assistance. Innovative solutions like the ICDDR’s oxygen therapy are already making an impact in saving developing-world families facing serious yet treatable health and medical issues. We’ve partnered with Johnson &amp; Johnson to bring you five of the most inspiring tools and techniques that are improving the lives of children, and their mothers, around the world.   The Q-Mat A Simple Method for Preventing the No. 1 Cause of Maternal Mortality  Photo credit: Shahidul Alam  Accounting for 27 percent of all maternal deaths at birth, postpartum hemorrhage is a leading cause of maternal mortality. But a simple product aims to change that.   When birth takes place outside a clinical setting, the difficulty in judging the amount of blood loss can delay the intervention necessary to prevent death. Q-Mat, a biodegradable birthing mat developed by Dr. Md. Abdul Quaiyum at the ICDDR, warns of dangerous blood loss so that attendants can seek professional help quickly. The size of the mat is standardized to absorb about 400 milliliters of blood; if it becomes saturated, immediate medical help is required.  A Grand Challenges Grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has aided in the development of the Q-Mat. A new validation study is underway, and the results have been promising. Quaiyum estimates that in trials, the mat has already saved 37 lives. After the testing phases, the Q-Mat should be available for wide use.  Jaundice Sunlight Canopy Using the Sun to Prevent Death and Disability  Photo credit: Courtesy of Dr. Tina Slusher, University of Minnesota  Jaundice is incredibly common among -- and deadly for -- newborns in the developing world, but now there's a low-tech solution that uses the sun to treat the disease.   Caused by an infant's initial inability to keep pace with excess bilirubin, a byproduct of the normal breakdown of red blood cells in the body, hyperbilirubinemia produces the telltale yellow cast of jaundice. Most healthy babies are able to overcome hyperbilirubinemia on their own as their livers mature, but for an estimated half a million babies, the condition is severe, leading to 114,000 deaths each year and leaving 63,000 infants with serious brain damage.  Exposing babies to sunshine has been known for centuries to improve jaundice. Light, specifically in the blue wavelength range, changes the bilirubin molecules, making them easier for the body to excrete. However, simply exposing babies to direct sunlight has obvious inherent risks. In hospital settings, phototherapy using lamps or blankets that emit blue light is the common course of action. But in low-resource areas, where electricity is unreliable and blue light technologies unaffordable, other methods are needed.  A study by researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in September, has proven that sunshine filtered by commercially available plastic films -- which can be stretched over canopies -- is both safe and as effective a treatment as conventional blue light therapy.   &quot;The trouble with sunlight is that it comes with other rays -- UVA, UVB, UVC and so on,&quot; notes Dr. David Stevenson, senior associate dean for maternal and child health at Stanford and the study’s senior author. By filtering out these harmful rays, the risks of sunburn and overheating are significantly reduced. “[It] makes sunlight safe,” Stevenson says.  The canopies were developed and tested over a 10-month period in Lagos, Nigeria. There, 224 babies received filtered sunlight therapy, while 223 babies received conventional phototherapy. The results were positive with the filtered sunlight, effective on 93 percent of treatment days.  As Stevenson sums up, “Effective, low-cost solutions are possible without having to reproduce everything we have in Western settings.”  Telemedicine  Clinical Expertise That Crosses Continents  Photo credit: White Ribbon Alliance India  At its simplest, telemedicine transports medical knowledge and support using telecommunications systems to areas where facilities and personnel aren't always readily available. It has been one of this century’s most important developments in health care. From smartphone apps to surgeons assisted by Google Glass, telemedicine lowers costs and saves lives.  MomConnect, an initiative launched by South Africa’s National Department of Health (NDoH) and supported by a group of maternal-health–focused NGOs, uses SMS technology to communicate with the country’s pregnant and postnatal moms via their mobile phones. Now in its second year, the program sends women who have registered with MomConnect messages that are tailored to their stage of pregnancy and, later, early parenthood. The information offers advice on good maternal health, safe labor practices, newborn care and more. MomConnect users can also provide feedback about their maternal-care experiences to a confidential help desk, bringing the NDoH’s attention to issues and complaints in real time. The program is off to a promising start: More than a half million women have already received MomConnect messages, and one in three pregnancies in South Africa were recorded during its first year.   Even in environments where access to smartphones and the Internet is limited, telemedicine can still make a huge impact. In India, the White Ribbon Alliance deployed an interactive voice response system using a toll-free number and basic cell phone technology that, similarly to MomConnect, provides assistance to expectant mothers. Perhaps more importantly, the system also allows them to provide feedback on the health care services they've received.   The so-called MoM-QC program aims to improve health care for mothers and infants by not only educating patients on what to expect, but also by creating a feedback loop where their actual experiences encourage facilities to improve. “MoM-QC helps empower women to know their rights and make informed choices and decisions about where they wanted to have their children,” explains Andrea Miles, director of partnerships at the White Ribbon Alliance.  After the five-month pilot, which ended in 2014, nearly all participants had improved their knowledge of quality of care, and 87 percent said the information received and quality of care feedback provided had empowered them to make better choices for themselves and their family members.  “When my first child died, I didn’t even ask the doctor why it happened,&quot; says Sunita Devi, 22, who participated in MoM-QC’s pilot program during her second pregnancy. &quot;Now I would ask more questions.”  In a country that's home to 17 percent of all maternal deaths worldwide, the importance of giving women in India a voice in controlling and regulating the quality of their health care cannot be overstated.  FoneAstra Milk Pasteurization Monitor Smartphones Are Helping Provide Safe, Pasteurized Breast Milk to Infants in Need  photo credit: PATH/Christopher Nelson  While breast milk is widely considered the preferred for source of nourishment for babies, many infants in the developing world cannot get breast milk from their biological mothers or milk banks, which have long been hindered by fears over HIV transmission. Smartphones are changing that.   Working with the University of Washington’s department of computer science and engineering, and supported in part by a Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Grant, PATH, an international health organization, developed the FoneAstra system. It’s a smartphone-based monitoring system that offers a low-cost way to monitor and regulate the flash-heat pasteurization of human milk. The system is especially critical for many milk banks that either don't require or can't yet afford commercial-grade milk pasteurization units.   “People are afraid of [milk banks]. HIV was found in breast milk in the 1980s, and milk banks just never recovered from that,” says Kiersten Israel-Ballard, senior program officer and technical officer at PATH. “People have a fear of the quality and the safety.”  Helping people to overcome those fears has been one of the most significant -- and rewarding -- benefits of the FoneAstra system. “To watch [the staff of the South African clinics] go from being afraid of donor human milk, afraid of what a milk bank is, to learning the system and learning the benefits, becoming completely converted and supportive and advocates, is amazing,” remarks Israel-Ballard. &quot;That message carries. It carries not only to the mothers they care for, but to other nurses and their colleagues. That fire has started there.&quot;  Bubble CPAP A Low-Cost Oxygen Therapy Seeking to Help the Nearly 1 Million Children Who Die from Pneumonia Each Year   Dr. Md. Jobayer Chisti has devoted the past several years to perfecting a system of delivering bubble continuous positive airway pressure, or &quot;bubble CPAP,&quot; to children in low-resource settings. Bubble CPAP has been available in higher income countries for decades and is the accepted treatment for newborns experiencing respiratory distress, thanks to its ability to help keep neonate lungs from collapsing. The high cost of equipment, however, has prevented its use in low-resource environments.  Chisti's low-cost system -- initially designed using a sterile shampoo bottle and standard hospital tubing -- has shown promising results in early testing; children who received Chisti’s bubble CPAP oxygen therapy had a significantly lower risk of death than children who received standard low-flow oxygen therapy. Based on these results, it has become the standard of care at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, where Chisti is based.  While he hopes his system becomes the standard throughout Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, &quot;The low-cost bubble CPAP technology requires further clinical testing,” Chisti says, “and [ICDDR] is working with international colleagues to develop further research plans to scale-up bubble CPAP in district hospitals in Bangladesh and other developing countries.&quot;   Many more inspired, sustainable solutions to the world’s most urgent health concerns continue to see success as they scale up. For instance, a recent nominee in the Saving Lives at Birth: A Grand Challenge for Development initiative was the NIFTY cup, a pioneering silicone cup that promises to help 9 million children who struggle to breastfeed due to craniofacial anomalies and other reasons. In order to save the lives of millions of children and hundreds of thousands of mothers, it’s imperative that we support these types of lifesaving innovations on a global scale.

Google announced Tuesday that its Inbox email service will be able to compose simple replies for its users beginning this Thursday. The &quot;Smart Reply&quot; function will predict which of your emails can be answered with a &quot;short reply&quot; and then write and present a few possible responses for you to choose from. Yes, this is real, and it'll look like this.  Pretty wild, right? A spokeswoman for Google told The Huffington Post that Inbox will get better at predicting the replies you need based on which ones you select. &quot;For example, when Smart Reply was tested at Google, a common suggestion in the workplace was 'I love you.' Thanks to their feedback, Smart Reply is SFW,&quot; Bálint Miklós, a software engineer at Google, wrote in a blog post. &nbsp;  If the whole thing feels a little icky to you -- perhaps because a machine is co-opting a major source of communication that previously required effort and emotion from your squishy human brain -- note that the update is only for Inbox, not Gmail. If you're a Gmail user, you can sign up for Inbox, but you certainly don't have to.&nbsp; &nbsp; A spokeswoman for Google also confirmed to HuffPost that it'll only work on Inbox's iOS and Android apps -- not the desktop version. &nbsp; Inbox, which was first introduced last year,&nbsp;is intended to sort through your email and present everything to you in a more convenient way. For example, it can recognize which of your emails are promotions from companies, which are reminders you sent to yourself and so on. Its ability to automatically compose replies is thus something of a natural evolution for a service that's already adept at digesting your messages. If you use Google services and you're concerned about what the company knows about you, don't forget that the tech giant recently introduced streamlined privacy controls.

The &quot;Avengers&quot; actor probably wishes he did really have Hulk powers after participating in Jimmy Kimmel's Halloween YouTube Challenge this year. You know, just for survival. Ruffalo dropped by Kimmel's show on Monday to talk about his new movie, &quot;Spotlight,&quot; and also brought a video of his kids' reactions after he told them he ate all of their Halloween candy. Spoiler alert:&nbsp;They completely freak out. Good luck,&nbsp;Hulk.&nbsp;The other Avengers are probably staying out of this one. &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET on ABC.

Rowling revealed that she's partway done with a new children's book -- her first since the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. Rowling has, of course, written since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows debuted in 2007. She penned the adult novel The Casual Vacancy under her own name, and the Cormoran Strike series of crime novels under a pseudonym, Robert Galbraith.&nbsp; But she won't try to fool us again with another pen name.&nbsp;Rowling said she has plans to write under &quot;J.K. Rowling&quot;&nbsp;in the future,&nbsp;before hinting, &quot;Novels in the plural.&quot;&nbsp;The first one just might be another book for young readers. &quot;I have written part of a children's book that I really love, so I'm definitely going to finish that. There will will be another children's book,&quot; the author said. She didn't give any other details about it or whether it might relate in any way to the Harry Potter universe. But, since she's already written a play to cover the years after our last glimpse of young Harry, Ron and Hermione -- &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,&quot; which debuts in London next summer&nbsp;-- and stated she doesn't want to tell that story in novel-form, it seems unlikely.&nbsp; Rowling, though, admitted she'll never be short on story ideas. &quot;I sometimes worry I'll die before I've written them all out,&quot; she said. &quot;That's my mid-life crisis.&quot; &nbsp; Also on HuffPost:  -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

That's because obesity is increasingly linked to the disease: &quot;It's on track to overtake tobacco as the leading preventable cause of cancer,&quot; says Therese Bevers, MD, medical director of the Cancer Prevention Center at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston. Experts still don't know a lot about the link -- including whether being overweight, rather than obese, carries equal risk, and if there's a better measure out there than the oft-maligned BMI scale. But in a landmark 2003 New England Journal of Medicine study, researchers found that the heaviest women (in this case, those with a BMI of 40 or higher) had death rates from cancer that were 62 percent higher than women with BMIs in the healthy range. In fact, one-third of all cancer deaths in the U.S. each year are linked to poor diet and too-little physical activity, which includes obesity. Higher levels of insulin, growth factors, inflammation, sex hormones -- all are more common in obese patients and are possible explanations for how having a heavier body increases your odds of developing cancer, says Jennifer Ligibel, MD, senior physician at the Susan F. Smith Center for Women's Cancers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, in Boston. It's important to remember that obesity isn't linked to increased risk of every kind of cancer though, says Steven Clinton, MD, PhD, cancer researcher at the Ohio State University, in Columbus. &quot;Endometrial, ovarian, esophageal adenocarcinoma, postmenopausal breast cancer, colon -- those are the ones that are most strikingly related to weight,&quot; he says. If you have more questions about the relationship between obesity and cancer, or you're wondering if your weight puts you at higher risk, bring it up with your doctor at your next checkup.
