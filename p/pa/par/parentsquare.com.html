	<p>The privacy policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use, and safeguard the personal information you or your school provides and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site. The school refers to the staff personnel and PTA/ PTO executives including but not limited to the principal, teachers and the school administrative staff and the PTA/ PTO members at your children's school(s). </p>

	<p>This statement will be continuously assessed against new technologies, ethical practices, and the needs of our users.</p>

	<p>We do not sell or exchange your information with any organization, public, private, or nonprofit other than your school.</p>

	<h3>No Information from Children Under Age 13</h3>
	<p>If you are under age 13, please do not attempt to register for ParentSquare or provide any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.</p>

	<h3>What Information Do We Collect</h3>
	<p>You or your school may provide us with two types of information: personal information you or your school knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and website use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our website.</p>

	<h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
	<p>When your school chooses to use ParentSquare, the school provides us with your name and email address and the name of the class you child is in and this information is available to registered ParentSquare users in your school. During the registration process you provide us with your child(ren)’s name(s) and class(es). Once you register you can provide other information about yourself such as your phone numbers, address, profession, talent, interests and abilities. All information you provide to us is made accessible to other users in your school. This information is not shared with users outside of your school, but may be made available to your school's district office should they request it.</p>

	<h3>Information We Collect when You Interact With ParentSquare</h3>
	<h4>Site Activity Information</h4> <p>We keep track of some of the actions you take on ParentSquare. For example, if you add a comment, in addition to storing the actual comment, we log the fact that you added a comment.</p>

	<h4>Access Device and Browser Information</h4> <p>When you access ParentSquare from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, the pages you visit, the date and time of visits, time spent at our website, and the sites visited just before and just after ours. This information is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with you as an individual.</p>


	<h4>Cookie Information</h4> <p>We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer) to make ParentSquare easier to use and to protect both you and ParentSquare. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to ParentSquare. We also use them to confirm that you are logged into ParentSquare. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use ParentSquare.</p>

	<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
	<p>We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of the details on how we do that.</p>

	<h4>To Manage the Service</h4> <p>We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support.</p>

	<h4>To Contact You</h4> <p>We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time. This includes contacting you for any school related activities. We may include content you see on ParentSquare in the emails we send to you. We may also contact you to notify you about important changes to our website.</p>

	<h4>How We Protect Information</h4><p>We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction.</p>

	<h3>Deactivating or Deleting Your Account</h3>
	<p>If your child leaves the school and you are no longer associated with the school, the school will deactivate your account. When you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be deleted. When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from ParentSquare. If you wish to delete your account, please send an email to your school representative or contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@parentsquare.com">webmaster@parentsquare.com</a> Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 90 days, but will not be available to others.</p>
