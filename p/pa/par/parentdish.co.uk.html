<strong>AOL's Commitment to protecting your privacy</strong>
</p>
<p class="article_body ">
A key part of AOL's commitment to protecting your privacy is to explain how we may use the personal information we collect, the choices you have about its use, and the steps we take to help protect your privacy whilst you interact with AOL.
  
In the provision of the web based sites, pages, services and software (collectively the "AOL Web Services") and other content and offerings from AOL (UK) Limited, our subsidiaries and/or affiliated companies (together the "AOL Network") ("AOL" or "we" or "our") and other data processors acting under our control may collect, process, store and use aggregate information, and any information which may identify you or your web services account (your "Personal Information") in various ways and for different purposes. AOL collects this information when you give this to us or when you interact with the AOL Network.
