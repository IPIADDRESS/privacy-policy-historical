              information ("PII") you may disclose publicly in user forums (such 
              as chat rooms, message boards, or similar web pages). PII is information

              <br>
              Protecting children's privacy is important to us. For that reason, 
              we do not collect or maintain information at our Web Site from those 
              we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Web Site is targeted 
              to attract anyone under 13. We request that all visitors under 13 
              to our Web Site not disclose or provide any PII. If we discover 
              that a child under 13 has provided us with PII, we will delete the 
              child's PII from our records. <br>

              <a name="oiw"></a>OTHER INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b><br>
              <br>
              <b>Log Data:</b> When you visit this Web Site, our web servers automatically 
              collect anonymous information that describes how our visitors use 
              and navigate our Web Site, and which includes the number and frequency 
              of visitors to each web page and the length of their stays, as well 
              as the anonymous information automatically sent to us by your web 
              browser, such as browser type, referrer data that identifies the 
              web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Web Site, 
              and IP addresses. We also may determine what technology is available 
              through your browser in order to serve you the most appropriate 
              version of a web page. For example, we may determine that you have 
              installed a version of Flash, and we will then send you the appropriate 
              Flash version of the web page rather than an HTML page. <br>
              <br>
              <b>IP Addresses:</b> An IP address is a number that is assigned 
              to your computer or network when you are on the Internet. When visitors 
              request pages from our Web Site, our servers log the visitor's IP 
              address. We may collect IP addresses for a variety of internal purposes, 
              such as system administration, to report aggregate information to 
              our advertisers, and to audit the number of visits to different 
              pages on our Web Site.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Cookies</b>: Cookies are information files that our Web Site 
              may place on your computer to provide extended functionality. We 
              may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as tracking usage 
              patterns on the Web Site, measuring the effectiveness of advertising, 
              or limiting multiple responses and registrations when we conduct 
              polls and sweepstakes. We do not store any PII in cookies, and we 
              do not link the cookies to any PII we collect. We will not use cookies 
              to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally 
              sent by us to you in a cookie. Advertisers or other third parties 
              that are serving content on some of our pages may set and access 
              their own cookies on your computer. Such third parties' use of cookies 
              is subject to their own privacy policies, which may differ from 
              this one. Such third parties do not have access to our cookies. 
              <br>
              <br>
              You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating 
              this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, 
              it is possible that some parts of our Web Site will not operate 
              correctly if you disable cookies. You should consult with your browser's 
              provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling 
              cookies.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Web Beacons:</b> While you are on our Web Site, or while you 
              are otherwise viewing our content, you may encounter Web beacons, 
              which may come from PDE or from third parties, such as advertisers 
              or content providers. A Web beacon, which is sometimes also called 
              a Web bug or "clear gif", is a small graphic image in a Web page, 
              a Web-based document or an e-mail message, which generally allows 
              the party that set the Web beacon to monitor certain information 
              about the viewer of the Web page, Web-based document or e-mail message, 
              and it may allow access to certain cookies. Web beacons are usually 
              invisible to the user, because they are very small (generally 1-by-1 
              pixel). However, in general, any electronic image viewed as part 
              of a Web page, including an advertisement, can act as a Web beacon. 
              Web beacons typically collect the URL of the page the Web beacon 
              comes from, the type of browser requesting the Web beacon, the IP 
              address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to and the time 
              the Web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can also be linked to PII, 
              but PDE does not link information gathered through Web beacons to 
              PII. PDE may use Web beacons to count visitors to our Web pages 
              and we may include Web beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters 
              in order to count how many newsletters (or particular articles, 
              links, etc.) we sent were actually opened. We aggregate all information 
              we collect through Web beacons and we do not use Web beacons to 
              track any individuals' use of the Web Site. PDE does not have control 
              over Web beacons used by third parties and does not have access 
              to whatever information they may collect.<br>
              <br>
              <b><a name="hwu"></a>HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION WE 
              COLLECT </b><br>
              <br>
              We use the PII you provide about yourself to provide the information 
              or content you have requested, to contact you about our programs, 
              products, features or services or for other purposes disclosed at 
              the time of collection. For instance, we may notify you that you 
              have won a sweepstakes, send you an email newsletter or send you 
              information about an upcoming television program or movie. If you 
              e-mail someone else an electronic greeting card or other special 
              feature from our Web Site, we will use the information you provide 
              about someone else to send that person the requested e-mail. If 
              you do not wish to receive information about our programs, products, 
              features or services, you may update your preferences at any time 
              by returning to the registration area of the Web Site or Web Sites 
              for which you registered.<br>
              <br>
              We may send you information from our corporate affiliates, including 
              our parent company, Viacom, Inc. and its subsidiaries. If you do 
              not wish to receive this information, you may opt out of such use 
              at any time by returning to the registration area of the Web Site 
              or Web Sites for which you registered.<br>
              <br>
              We use non-identifying information collected on our Web Site in 
              the aggregate to better understand your use of the Web Site and 
              to enhance your enjoyment and experience. For example, we may use 
              the information to improve the design and content of our Web Site 
              or to analyze the programs and services we offer. We may also share 
              non-identifying aggregate information with third parties. For example, 
              we may tell advertisers how many individuals visit certain areas 
              of our Web Site, or how many men or women receive our newsletter. 
              <br>
              <br>
              We may share your PII with PPC and outside parties who sponsor sweepstakes 
              or other promotions on our Web Site. However, we will not share 
              your PII with outside parties unless you specifically agree to a 
              governing set of rules that allow such disclosure or otherwise give 
              us permission to do so.<br>
              <br>
              We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions 
              on our behalf. For instance, we may use third parties to host message 
              boards or other user forums, to develop software applications and 
              databases or to send communications on our behalf. Our employees, 
              agents and contractors who have access to PII are required to protect 
              the information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy 
              Policy.<br>
              <br>
              We may provide access to your PII when legally required to do so, 
              to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, 
              to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web Site, to 
              limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the 
              rights, property or safety of visitors of this Web Site or the public. 
              In those instances, the information is provided only for that purpose.<br>
              <br>
              PDE may also sell, transfer or otherwise disclose user information, 
              including PII, in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, 
              the sale of substantially all assets, or other fundamental corporate 
              change. <br>
              <br>
              We will not share your PII in ways unrelated to those described 
              above without providing you with an opportunity to opt out of such 
              use or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. <br>
