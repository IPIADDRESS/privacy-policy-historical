                  Privacy Policy
               </h1>
               <p>We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.</p>
<h3>(1) What information do we collect?</h3>
<p>We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:</p>
<p>(a) information about your visits to and use of this website;</p>
<p>(b) information about any transactions carried out between you and us on or in relation to this website, including information relating to any purchases you make of our goods or services;</p>
<p>(c) information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering with us and/or subscribing to our website services and/or email notifications.</p>
<h3>(2) Information about website visits</h3>
<p>We may collect information about you computer and your visits to this website such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of page views. We may use this information in the administration of this website, to improve the website's usability, and for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>We use cookies on this website. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.</p>
<p>We may send a cookie which may be stored on by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of this website, to improve the website's usability and for marketing purposes. We may also use that information to recognize your computer when you visit our website, and to personalize our website for you. Our advertisers may also send you cookies.</p>
<p>Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookie by clicking "Tools", "Internet Options", "Privacy", and selecting "Block all cookies" using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.</p>
<h3>(3) Using your personal data</h3>
<p>Personal data submitted on this website will be used for the purposes specified in this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the website.</p>
<p>In addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may use your personal information to:</p>
<p>(a) improve your browsing experience by personalizing the website;</p>
<p>(b) send information (other than marketing communications) to you which we think may be of interest to you by post or by email or similar technology;</p>
<p>(c) send to you marketing communications relating to our business or the businesses of carefully-selected third parties which we think may be of interest to you by post or, where you have specifically agreed to this, by email or similar technology.</p>
<p>(d) provide other companies with statistical information about our users - but this information will not be used to identify any individual user.</p>
<h3>(4) Products and Clients&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Pardot is the maker of Prospect Insight, a web marketing automation suite. Pardot sells and distributes Prospect Insight to third party clients who may use it to gather information about their own visitors and clients, including IP address, operating system, web browser, and pages visited. While Pardot sells only to ethical clients, it cannot be held responsible if its clients engage in unethical use of the information gathered through Prospect Insight.</p>
<h3>(5) Other disclosures</h3>
<p>In addition to the disclosures reasonably necessary for the purposes identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may disclose information about you:</p>
<p>(a) to the extent that we are required to do so by law;</p>
<p>(b) in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings;</p>
<p>(c) in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk).</p>
<h3>(6) Security of your personal data</h3>
<p>We will take reasonable precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. Of course, data transmission over the Internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the Internet.</p>
<p>We will store all the personal information you provide on our secure servers. Pardot may also store Your login or password information for any third party applications You denote as a connector. These may include, but are not limited to, salesforce.com, SugarCRM and Google AdWords. This information is encrypted for security and is used solely to provide a connection between Prospect Insight and the third party application and will not be shared with any entity other than the third party in question.</p>
<p>You are responsible for keeping your passwords confidential. We will not ask you for your passwords.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>(7) Policy amendments</h3>
<p>We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time by posting a new version on our website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy with any changes.</p>
<h3>(8) Third party websites</h3>
<p>The website contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of third party websites.</p>
<h3>(9) Contact</h3>
<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our treatment of your personal data, please write to us by email to info (at) pardot.com or by post to Pardot LLC, 950 East Paces Ferry Rd, Suite 2440, Atlanta, GA 30326.</p>
