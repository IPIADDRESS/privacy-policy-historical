    at the same time, respect your privacy. We’ve crafted the policy below to be as clear and straightforward as
    possible. Please feel free to contact us with any questions or feedback at

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) covers how Paribus Co. (“we,” “us,” “our,” and “Paribus”) treats
    Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") and other information that Paribus collects in connection
    with its websites, mobile applications, platforms, premium services, or any content or information
    provided as part of the Paribus services (collectively, “Paribus” or the “Services”). </p>

<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your registration or use of any part of the Services will
    constitute your notice about and agreement to our collection and use of your information in accordance
    with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to us collecting or using your information in accordance
    with this Privacy Policy, do not use the Services and close your account.</p>

<p>We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, and if we make material changes to it, we will
    provide notice through our Services, or by other means so that you may review the changes before you
    continue to use the Services. If you object to any changes, you may close your account. Continuing to
    use the Services after we publish or communicate a notice about any changes to this Privacy Policy means
    that you are consenting to the changes.</p>

<h2>2. Scope of Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected through the Services. It does not apply to
    information collected elsewhere, including, without limitation, offline or on sites linked to through
    the Services. It does not apply to any third-party activities, such as third-party websites linked from
    our Services, third-party social networking platforms, or third-party ads displayed on our Services. We
    are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of third parties. We encourage you to read the
    privacy statements of those third parties.</p>

<p>We consider PII to be information that can be traced directly back to and identifies a specific
    individual or household, such as name, physical address, email address, phone number, or billing
    information. We do not consider PII to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not
    allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual or household. Paribus does not share PII
    with non-affiliated third parties except as specified in Section 4.5, Section 4.7, and Section 4.8 </p>

<h2>3. The Information We Collect From You</h2>

<h3>3.1. Registration and connecting your Accounts</h3>

    account (collectively, “Accounts”) with the Services. This information generally includes, but is not
    limited to, your name, and email address. It may also include, but is not limited to, your login
    credentials, website ID, public profile with the service, and demographic information. </p>

<p>Upon connecting your Accounts with the Services, Paribus may scan your emails and collect information
    from your Accounts relating to your online purchases, offline purchases, shopping history, and any

    <a href="/terms/">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<h3>3.3 Using the Services</h3>

    not logged into the Services, we may collect your IP address, device identifier, browser type, device
    type, mobile phone carrier, domain name, access times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform, new
    and repeat information, time stamp, exit page information, geolocation, and other information about how
    you use the Services.</p>

<p>Paribus also collects information from your Accounts as long as your Accounts are connected to the
    Services. Paribus may scan your emails and collect information from your Accounts relating to your
    online purchases, offline purchases, shopping history, and any information necessary to further the
    Services.</p>

<p>Paribus also collects information when you submit a claim for a partial refund/credit to a third party.

<h3>3.4 Customer Service</h3>

<p>When you contact our customer support services, we collect information that helps us categorize your
    question, respond to it, and, if applicable, investigate any breach of our <a href="/terms/">Terms of Service</a> or this
    Privacy Policy. We also use this information to track potential problems and trends and customize our
    support responses to better serve you.</p>

<h3>3.5. Cookies, Advertising Technologies, and Web Beacons</h3>

<p>We may use cookies and similar technologies to help us recognize you across the Services, improve your
    Paribus experience, increase security, measure use and effectiveness of our Services, and serve
    advertising. You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools. By using the
    Services, you consent to the placement of cookies and beacons in your browser and HTML-based emails in
    accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>

<h3>3.6 Other</h3>

<p>Paribus seeks to improve the services we offer you. We often introduce new features, some of which may result in

    features, and we may potentially collect new types of information.</p>

<h2>4. How we use your Personal Information</h2>

<h3>4.1 Consent to Paribus Processing Information About You</h3>

<p>By registering with or using the Services, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions
    of the <a href="/terms/">Terms of Service</a> and freely accepting and agreeing to our
    processing of your information in ways set out
    by this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p>Supplying to us any information is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw or
    modify your consent to Paribus’ collection and processing of the PII you provide at any time, in

<h3>4.2 Paribus Communications</h3>

<p>The information you provide us allows us to communicate with you. We may communicate with you through
    email, notices posted on the Services, and other means available through the Services. Examples of these
    communications include: (1) welcome and engagement communications; (2) service communications covering
    service availability, security, and other issues about the functioning of the Services; and (3)
    promotional communications that may contain promotional information from us or third parties. You can
    opt out of promotional messages by sending a request to <a href="mailto:support@paribus.co">support@paribus.co<script cf-hash="f9e31" type="text/javascript">
/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t="currentScript"in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName("script"),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute("cf-hash"))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute("data-cfemail");if(a){for(e="",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]> */</script></a>.
    Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from Paribus.</p>

<h3>4.3 Customized Content and Improved Experience</h3>

<p>We use the information that you provide to us to customize content and improve your user experience. For
    example, information regarding your online purchases, offline purchases, and shopping history allows us
    monitor price changes for products you purchased and file claims on your behalf. </p>

<p>We also use the information that you provide us to improve our products and services for all users,
    conduct research, and develop and maintain anonymous and aggregated data and analytics. For example,
    information regarding your online purchases, aggregated with the information of other users, allows us
    to decipher industry wide trends.</p>

<h3>4.4. Sharing Information with Affiliates</h3>

<p>We may share your PII with our Paribus affiliates (meaning entities controlled by, controlling or under
    common control with Paribus) as necessary to provide the Services. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy,
    you are consenting to this sharing. </p>

<p>Any Paribus affiliate will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you
    provide to us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy and the <a href="/terms/">Terms
        of Service</a>.</p>

<h3>4.5. Sharing Information with Service Providers</h3>

<p>We may employ third parties and individuals to develop, improve, and/or facilitate our Services (e.g.
    maintenance, analysis, audit, marketing and development). These third parties have limited access to
    your PII only to perform these tasks on our behalf.</p>

<p>You recognize and agree that these third parties may combine the information collected with other
    information they have independently collected from other services or products relating to your
    activities. Paribus is not responsible for any information these companies have independently collected
    and used under their own privacy policies.</p>

<h3>4.6. Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3>

<p>Paribus does not share PII with non-affiliated third parties except as specified in Section 4.5, Section
    4.7, and Section 4.8 </p>

<p>We may share anonymous and aggregated information and analytics relating to you with third parties. Such information
    may be of value to third parties in the performance of marketing
    services, including evaluating market trends and/or under a joint marketing agreement to provide services that will
    be of particular interest and relevance to you.
    When you deactivate your Paribus account, your PII is permanently disassociated with your
    purchase information. We may continue to use and share any anonymous and aggregated
    information and analytics relating to you.</p>

<p>When you deactivate your Paribus account, your PII is permanently disassociated with your purchase data.
    The anonymized purchase data itself may continue to be incorporated in market analyses.</p>

<h3>4.7 Compliance with Legal Process and Other Disclosures</h3>

<p>It is possible that we may need to disclose your PII to third parties when required by law, subpoena, or
    other legal process, or if Paribus has a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to
    (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist
    government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce the <a href="/terms/">Terms of
        Service</a>, investigate and defend ourselves
    against any third-party claims or allegations, or protect the security or integrity of our Services; or
    (3) exercise or protect the rights, property, or safety of Paribus, our users, personnel, or others. We
    attempt to notify users about legal demands for their data when appropriate in our judgment, unless
    prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. In light of our principles, we may
    dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overboard, vague or lack
    proper authority, but do not commit to challenge every demand. </p>

<h3>4.8 Disclosure to Others as the Result of a Change in Control or Sale of Paribus Co</h3>

<p>We may disclose your PII to a third party as part of a transfer or sale of the assets of Paribus Co., a
    subsidiary, or division, or as the result of a change in control of the company or one of its
    affiliates, or in preparation for any of these events.</p>

<p>Any third party to which Paribus transfers or sells Paribus’ assets will have the right to continue to
    use the personal and other information that you provide to us in the manner set out in this Privacy
    Policy and the Terms of Service.</p>

<h2>5. Your Information</h2>

<h3>5.1 Rights to Access, Correct, or Delete Your Information, and Closing Your Account</h3>

<p>You have a right to (1) access, modify, correct, or delete your PII controlled by Paribus; and (2) close
    your account. You can access, modify, correct, or delete your PII by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@paribus.co">support@paribus.co<script cf-hash="f9e31" type="text/javascript">
/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t="currentScript"in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName("script"),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute("cf-hash"))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute("data-cfemail");if(a){for(e="",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]> */</script></a>,
    specifying the request sought with proof of identity. If you close your account(s), your information
    will generally be removed from the Services within 10 business days. We generally delete closed account
    information and will de-personalize any logs or other backup information within 30 days of account
    closure, except as noted below. You may not be able to access, correct, or eliminate any information
    that is not in our control. </p>

<h3>5.2 Data Retention</h3>

<p>We retain the PII you provide while your account is in existence or as needed to provide you the
    Services. Paribus may retain your PII even after you have closed your account if retention is reasonably
    necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes between
    users, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce this Privacy Policy and our <a href="/terms/">Terms of Service</a>. We may retain
    personal information, for a limited period of time, if requested by law enforcement. Paribus’ Customer
    Service may retain information for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and
    trend analysis only, but we generally delete or de-personalize closed account data consistent with
    Section 5.1.</p>

<h2>6. Important Information</h2>

    your personal information, or to the Privacy Policy, we will provide notice to you on the Services or by
    some other means, such as email. Please review the changes carefully. If you agree to the changes,
    simply continue to use our Services. If you object to any of the changes to our terms and you no longer
    wish to use Paribus, you may close your account(s). Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy
    applies to all information that Paribus has about you and your account. Using the Services after a
    notice of changes has been communicated to you or published on our Services shall constitute consent to
    the changed terms or practices.</p>

<h3>6.3. Security</h3>

<p>Paribus limits access to your PII. We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures
    in an effort to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and use
    correctly the PII we collect from you.</p>

<p>No data transmissions through the Internet or mobile devices, or even the physical transfer of
    information, are completely secure. We cannot fully eliminate all security risks associated with
    personal information, and technical mistakes are possible. We do not ensure or warrant the security of
    any data or information you transmit to us and any information you disclose to us is at your own risk.
    Please help keep your account safe by using a strong password.</p>

<p>If Paribus learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically. You
    agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative
    issues. We may post a notice on our website if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need
    a web browser enabling you to view and access Paribus. We may also send an email to you at the email
    address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive
    notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to
    withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice), you should notify us at <a href="mailto:support@paribus.co">support@paribus.co<script cf-hash="f9e31" type="text/javascript">
