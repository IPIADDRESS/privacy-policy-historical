<p>Parchment, Inc. (“Company”) takes your privacy seriously. This  Web  site (“Site”) is a general corporate Web site, through which we  provide  information about us and our various products and services and  through  which you may register for the Docufide platform including,  Docufide  Sender, Docufide Receiver and our other products and services   individually and collectively, the “Services”). We use information that   we collect from you and your school or college to efficiently provide   our online Services, to improve your experience in using the Site and   our various Services, to aid in communications between Parchment and you   and to notify you of Services that we think may be of interest to you.   We want to be clear: We will not use your personally identifiable   information for any Service without your specific prior approval. This   is uniformly true whether you are a student, parent or school/college   staff member. For more information about our commitment to privacy,   please read our detailed privacy policy, which is stated below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
<p>Automatic  collection of information. Like many Web sites on the  Internet, we  automatically track certain information about you as you  use our Site.  This information may include, for example, your IP  address, browser type  and Internet connection speed. In addition, we  may employ the use of  “cookies” in certain areas of our Site. A cookie  is a small amount of  data that is sent to your browser from a Web  server that may be stored  on your computer’s hard drive. For the most  part, the cookies we would  use would be “session cookies,” meaning they  are automatically deleted  at the end of a Site visit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information you enter. We  also collect information you choose to  provide us through the Site or  via email. For example, we obtain  information when you complete a  registration form or feedback form,  contact us requesting information,  purchase our Services, respond to a  survey, or contact a customer  support representative. For students,  this information may include, for  example, your name, email address,  postal address, phone number(s),  school affiliation, graduation year,  gender and other demographic  information, student identification  number(s) and destination schools.  Services order forms may also  request credit card, debit card or online  check or other billing  information as well as information sufficient to  identify your academic  record(s). For schools, this information may  include, for example, the  institution’s name, address, phone numbers,  URLs, email address(es)  and the names and contact information for  administrators and staff  responsible for handling student transcripts  and other admission  documents. You can choose not to provide us with  certain personal or  institutional information, but then you may not be  able to successfully  complete orders for Services or take full advantage  of the features of  our Site. When using the Services offered on the  Site, Company may  collect information regarding such use including any  communications  made or transactions entered into by you or your  institution or  students, as applicable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Who is collecting your information?</h3>
<p>When  you provide information through the Site, the information is   transmitted through the Internet and stored on servers owned and   maintained by Parchment or, with respect to credit card and other   billing information and information maintenance, the designated service   providers which Parchment may from time to time engage to handle  account  billing and processing and information maintenance. You will be   informed if any third party other than a Parchment service provider is   involved in collecting information from you through use of the Site.  In  such situations, you can elect not to share the information  requested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parchment  service providers, affiliates and partners, third party  advertisers and  other entities (such as industry advisors and other Web  sites that  offer commentary, publish reviews and/or offer online  discussion groups)  that have links on the Site may also collect  information about you when  you visit their Web sites or otherwise  communicate with them. Although  we encourage such third parties to  adopt and follow their own privacy  policies, we are not responsible for  their collection and use of user  information. THE INFORMATION  PRACTICES OF OTHER WEB SITES LINKED TO THE  SITE ARE NOT COVERED BY THIS  PRIVACY POLICY. You should refer to the  privacy policies and  statements of other Web sites or contact the  respective Webmasters of  those Web sites to obtain information regarding  their information  collection, use and disclosure&nbsp; policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How do we use your information?</h3>
<p>Personally  Identifying or Institution Identifying Information. Any  personally  identifying or institution identifying information that we  collect is  used to facilitate the provision of Services that you may  order and any  related transactions, personalize your account, maintain  and customize  the Services, develop new Company services, and allow  communication  between Parchment (its affiliates and service providers)  and you. For  institutions, this may include posting the school’s or  college’s name on  the Site as an institution that uses and/or accepts  the use of  Parchment’s Services as well as to the collection,  maintenance and  dissemination of aggregate data related to each  participating  institution’s use and/or acceptance of the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Personally  Identifying Information. We also generate, use and  make available for  others various statistics and information of a  non-personally  identifying nature relevant to the Services. This  non-personally  identifying information may include, but is not limited  to,  student-users’ Service purchasing and college application patterns,   trends, preferences, and other collective characteristics of  registered  student-users of the Site. Such non-personally identifying  statistical  information may consist of the aggregation of certain  personally  identifying information presented in such a manner that no  single  student or institution can be identified and may include,  without  limitation, academic data, application preferences, and  demographic and  geographic data. Upon receiving the consent of the   participating-institution, such aggregated data may be disseminated in a   manner which identifies the institution, but in no way identifies   individual students whose data comprises the aggregated statistics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>With whom do we share your information?</h3>
<p>Our  business hinges on security and the trust you place in us. We  will not  release any of your personally identifying information or  institution  identifying information to any third party without your  consent, except  as described in this Privacy Policy and in any  agreement entered into by  you in connection with the use of the  Services made available on this  Web site. We will share student-users’  personally identifying  information only with the applicable  student-user’s consent (or the  consent of such student’s parent, if the  student is not yet 18 years of  age) or under the following  circumstances:</p>
<ul class="standard-bullet">
<li>Designated  Academic Institutions. Through our Docufide Sender™  service or other  similar Service, we will transmit the transcripts and  other applicable  data of the student-user(s) purchasing such Services  to their designated  academic institution(s). Dissemination of  information through the  Services is more specifically addressed in the  terms governing the  purchase orders of such services as described in  our Student Agreement.</li>
<li>Service  providers. We will share certain information with the   school(s)/college(s) from which we obtain your transcript and academic   information. We may also use other companies and individuals to perform   supporting functions on our behalf for the various Services offered   through the Site, such as account billing and processing. These service   providers will not be permitted to use the information collected from   you for any purpose other than performing the support functions for   Parchment and/or offering additional Services, promotions or other   offers to you.</li>
<li>Protection of rights. We will release your  information if we  believe that such action is appropriate to: (1) comply  with any legal  process, (2) enforce the Terms of Use Agreement for the  Site, (3)  respond to claims that any information or content posted on  our site or  transmitted through the use of the Services violates the  rights of any  third party, or (4) protect the rights, property, or  personal safety  of Parchment, its affiliates and employees, other Site  users or others.</li>
<li>Asset transfers. We continue to develop our  business and in doing  so might choose to buy other businesses or assets.  User information is  generally one of the transferred assets acquired in  such purchases.  Also, if we should choose to sell some or all of our  assets, user  information, including the information collected from you  through this  Site, could be included in the transferred assets.<br>In  all other  circumstances, when we disclose any student-user information  to a third  party it will be in the form of aggregated statistical data  that  doesn't identify the student-user individually. This  non-identifying  information includes, for example, the purchasing  patterns, trends,  preferences, and other collective characteristics of  our users by  category, but not by individual, and serves to help us, our  business  affiliates and others evaluate and tailor our communications,   advertisements, products, services and general business practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Control of your information</h3>
<p>You  can correct and update the information you provide Parchment  (excluding  transcript or academic record information which may only be  modified by  the originating institution) by signing in to your account  and  accessing the Profile tab. From time to time, Parchment may provide  you  information on Parchment, Docufide or its various Services through   email, telephone solicitations, and/or postal mail. You can opt-out of   receiving these types of communications by contacting our Site   Administrator through the <a href="http://www.docufide.com/contact-us">contact forms</a>.  Please recognize that once your  information is disclosed to a third  party with your consent in  accordance with this Privacy Policy, we do  not provide a means of  opting-out of any communications that affiliates  may send to you and we  advise that you contact such service provider  or affiliate directly for  more information on any available opt-out  procedures. &nbsp;Of course, if you choose to share any information with non-Parchment affiliated individuals on the Parchment site - such as through the Essay system, the online forums or any other current or future optional service you choose to use - you do so knowing that Parchment has no control over what such individuals will do with the information you choose to reveal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We  use sophisticated technology designed to protect your information  and  all transmissions made through our Site. Here are some of the   highlights:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The personal or institution identifying  information that you provide  us is stored in secured facilities with  restricted access, and  protected by protocols and procedures designed to  ensure the security  of such information. In addition, all individuals  who have access to  such information are trained in the maintenance and  security of such  information, and we limit access of such information by  our employees  to the minimum information reasonably required in order  to provide  prompt, high quality Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the individual  students (or a parent of such student) does not  authorizes Parchment to  retain such personally identifiable  information, all transcript and  academic data obtained by Parchment in  the performance of its  transmission duties as part of its Services will  be stored on secure  servers, or in secure file storage if the  transmission was by  non-electronic means, only for a limited time and  all personally  identifiable information shall be deleted once Parchment  receives  confirmation that the applicable transcript and academic data  have been  successfully transmitted . Parchment may retain on its  servers after  completion of the ordered Services, without authorization  from the  student (or a parent), aggregate transcript and academic data  that is  not personally identifiable information or traceable to  specific  students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All personal or institution identifying  information that  you input on-line during completion of order forms or  other  correspondence with Company, including credit card, debit card or  other  billing information, is encrypted by not less than 128-bit  secure  sockets layer encryption protocols.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use of the Services  requires the user name and user-selected  password obtained by you during  registration. The use of a password  ensures that access to your account  is limited to you and anyone with  whom you share your password. In  order to ensure the effectiveness of a  password protection system, you  must diligently maintain the  confidentiality of your password. PARCHMENT  IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY  UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO AND RESULTING USE OF  YOUR ACCOUNT ACCOMPLISHED  THROUGH THE USE OF YOUR VALID AND CURRENT  PASSWORD.<br>Despite the most  thorough of precautions, no data  transmission over the Internet can be  guaranteed to be entirely secure.
