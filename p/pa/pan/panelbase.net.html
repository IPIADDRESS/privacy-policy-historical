<p>At panelbase.net we are committed to protecting your privacy. Panelbase.net is operated by <a href="http://www.dipsticksresearch.com" target="_blank">Dipsticks Research Ltd</a>, a professional market research agency who are also members of the <a href="http://www.mrs.org.uk/companypartner/companies.htm" target="_blank">Market Research Society's Company Partner scheme</a>.  Our primary business is to conduct research studies in order to provide insights for our clients, whilst ensuring that the personal identity of those participating in our surveys is protected. Results from surveys and research discussions are not linked to the individual identity of respondents without the informed consent of those respondents.</p>
<p>By using this site, you consent to the data practices described in this statement. </p>
<p><b>Information we gather on this web site</b></p>
<p>Personally identifiable information is only collected with your full knowledge and permission. In those circumstances where we retain personal information, it is used only for internal purposes and is never sold or otherwise transferred to any third party.</p>
<p>Our Web server recognises your Internet Service Provider and/or referrer's domain name, IP address and the identity of your Internet browser. This non-personal information helps panelbase.net to determine the total number of visitors to its website and to individual pages within the website.</p>
<p><b>Participation in online surveys</b></p>
<p>Panelbase.net conducts online surveys and the following are the guiding principles by which we conduct our business:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All of the information collected in our surveys will only be used for research purposes.</li>
  <li>We will never sell or otherwise transmit anyone's name or other personal information to a mailing list.</li>
  <li>The only personally identifiable information we may use is an e-mail address in order to contact registered panelbase.net members.</li>
  <li>For all research purposes, only aggregate data are used or data where all personally identifiable or sensitive information have been removed.</li>
  <li>We take all steps to protect the security and integrity of the information that respondents/participants provide.</li>
  <li>Respondents/participants have the right to check the data that have been collected and to correct inaccurate personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Why we use cookies</b></p>
<p>With interactive research, it is often necessary for us to associate short pieces of text, also known as "cookies", with users' internet browsers. A cookie allows us to recognise an internet browser, but does not give any personally identifiable information about the user. Our most common use of cookies is to prevent multiple completion of surveys via the same internet browser.</p>
<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p>Panelbase.net is committed to protecting the security of its members' personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect information from unauthorised access, use, or disclosure, both online and offline. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in access-controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal information over the Internet, such as your e-mail address, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
<p><b>Changes to the privacy Statement</b></p>
<p>We may occasionally update this privacy statement without notice.</p>
<p>Panelbase.net welcomes your comments regarding this privacy statement. If you believe that panelbase.net has not adhered to this privacy statement, please contact us by e-mail or postal mail (details below), and we will make every reasonable effort to promptly determine and remedy the problem.</p>
