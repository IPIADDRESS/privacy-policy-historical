        <div class="mrgn8"> <span class="maincopy"> This privacy policy is applicable
          to the Website accessible at www.panthers.com, www.carolinapanthers.com
          and www.cpanthers.com (collectively the “Site”), which is
          operated pursuant to a strategic relationship between Panthers Football
          LLC and Epic Cycle Interactive (collectively, the “PROVIDERS”,
          “we”, “our”, or “us”). The purpose of
          this privacy policy is to disclose to you what information we may collect,
          how we may collect it, with whom we may share it, and certain other
          matters related to such information, including the choices you have
          regarding our collection of information and our use and disclosure to
          other parties of information we may have collected from you.<br>
              <br>

							<span class="title3">TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED</span><br>
							The following are the types of information we may collect:<br><br>
							<font color="#003399"><b>Information You Provide Us:</b></font> Personal information that you
  							provide to us, such as your user ID and password, name, email address, telephone
  							number, physical address, birth date, gender or zip code or other information
  							may be collected via the Site.<br><br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>Site Usage Information:</b></font> We may receive and store certain
  							types of information whenever you visit the Site. For example, we may collect
  							click-stream data and your IP address.<br><br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>Email Communications:</b></font> When you open emails from the Site,
  							we may receive a confirmation noting you opened an email from us, if your computer
  							supports such capabilities. We also may keep track of what emails we send you
  							and what emails you may be receiving from us and our subsidiaries and affiliates.
  							Additionally, we keep a record of what types of emails you have opted to and
  							not to receive. <br><br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>Information from Other Sources:</b></font> We may receive information
							about you from other sources and add it to your personal information.<br><br>

							<span class="title3">HOW INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED</span><br>
							We may collect information from you in several different areas
							on the Site, including but not limited to those described below:<br><br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>Registration:</b></font> You may be asked first to complete a registration
							form and provide personally identifiable information; you may also be asked
							to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features
							the Site may choose to offer, including, but not limited to, Newsletters, Contests,
							Forums, Fantasy or other subscription-based services.<br><br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>Newsletters and Site Emails:</b></font> We may offer free newsletters
							to share information with you about the Site, about us and our affiliates and
							subsidiaries, or about our business partners and advertisers and sponsors. You
							may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or
							in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered
							on the Site. You may cancel your free email subscription by following the instructions
							provided on the Site or, in some instances, in the designated area of certain
							newsletters or emails.<br><br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>Contests or Sweepstakes:</b></font> We may operate contests and sweepstakes
							through the Site which may require registration. Your personally identifiable
							information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery
							confirmation or other related purposes. We may ask your permission to allow
							us to post publicly some of your information on the Site, such as on a winners
							page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. We will not post your information
							without your permission. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor
							may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Site, and collect your information.
							In those cases, where we are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes,
							we have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to
							review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the contest
							or sweepstakes before participating.<br><br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>Surveys or Voting:</b></font> From time–to-time we may request
							personally identifiable information from you via surveys or voting polls. Participation
							is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose
							information. At times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a
							survey. <br><br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>Cookies:</b></font> As with many Websites, the Site uses standard
							technology called “cookies,” which are small data files that are transferred
							to your computer when you allow your browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically
							identify your Web browser to the Site whenever you visit the Site, and make
							using the Site easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences.
							By tracking how and when you use the Site, cookies help us determine which areas
							are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Site are
							based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other
							things, to personalize your experience on the Site. Cookies may also allow the
							Site to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do
							not want information collected through the use of cookies, you generally can
							opt out of providing this information by turning the cookies off in your browser;
							however, some areas of the Site may not provide you with a personalized experience
							if you have disabled the use of cookies.<br><br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>IP Addresses and Click-stream Data:</b></font> We may collect IP addresses
							and/or click-stream data for purposes of system administration and to report
							aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors. An IP address is a number
							that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet.
							Our computers identify your computer by its IP address. When you request Web
							pages from the Site, our computers log your IP address. Click-stream data is
							information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Site.
							Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time,
							the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding
							page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data
							helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Site, what type of content is most
							popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular
							kinds of content and advertising, and the like.<br><br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>Transaction Information:</b></font> If you order any information from
							our Site, buy any of our products or subscribe for any of the services offered
							on our Site, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain
							information from you, including financial information such as a credit card
							number and expiration date and general contact, billing and shipping information.
							We will use this information to complete the transaction that you have requested,
							i.e., to deliver the information, products or other services that you order,
							and to invoice you. [Such information is collected and stored through encrypted
							means for your protection.]<br><br>

							<span class="title3">HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</span><br>
							Each of the PROVIDERS own the information collected via this Site.
							As applicable, the information you provide to us may be used to:
							<ul type="disc">
							<li>contact you about the Site;
 							 </li><li>contact you relating to your membership status;
 							 </li><li>confirm or fulfill an order you have made;
 							 </li><li>monitor or improve the use of the Site;
 							 </li><li>customize the advertising and content you see;
 							 </li><li>monitor compliance with our terms and conditions of use of the Site;
 							 </li><li>provide special offers to you from the PROVIDERS and/or their respective
 							 affiliates and subsidiaries and other third parties;
  							</li><li>send you promotional material on behalf of our business partners;
 							</li><li>inform you of a prize you have won.</li></ul>

							<span class="title3">WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED</span><br>
							At times, we may share your personally identifiable information
 							 with others for various purposes. The following outlines the ways in which your
 							 information may be shared with others:<br><br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>Agents:</b></font> We employ other businesses, certain services and
							  individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling
 							 orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists,
 							 Site analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit
 							 card payments, and providing customer service. These entities have access to
							  personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may
  							not use it for other purposes.<br><br>
              <font color="#003399"><b>Promotional Offers:</b></font> We may send
              offers by email to you on behalf of other partners. When we do this,
              we do not give that partner your name and address. If you do not
              want to receive such offers, you may opt out in response to the
              email.<br>
              <br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>Aggregate Information:</b></font> We may share aggregate information
							  such as demographics and Site usage statistics with advertisers, sponsors or
 							 other organizations. When this type of information is shared, the other parties
 							 do not have access to your personally identifiable information.<br><br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>Opt-in and Opt-out Programs:</b></font> Throughout the Site you may
							  be presented with opportunities to receive special offers from third parties.
							  An opt-in/opt-out message will ask you if you would like your information to
 							 be shared. If you do choose to have your information shared, in an effort to
  							protect you, third parties who have access to personally identifiable information
 							 must abide by the current Site privacy policy. However, we are not responsible
  							for the privacy practices of these other companies, and you should review the
 							 privacy practices of such Web sites prior to providing your personally identifiable
  							information.<br><br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>Third-Party Ad Serving:</b></font> The Site may use a third party
  							network advertiser to serve the advertisements on the Site. Network advertisers
 							 are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to this Site
 							 and other Web sites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target
 							 advertisements to you for products or Web sites you might be interested in.
							  Although advertisers or other companies do not have access to the Site cookies,
							 the Site's advertisers and sponsors may themselves set and access their own
 							 cookies on your computer if you choose to have your cookies enabled in your
							  browser. Cookies allow third party advertisers to show you advertisements or
							  content you might be interested in. Other companies' use of their cookies is
							  subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Please
 							 <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="top">click
							  here</a> in order to learn more about the information collection practices and "opt-out" procedures
 							 of third party ad servers we may use.<br><br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>Partners Subsidiaries and Affiliates:</b></font> We may share your
 							 information (including, without limitation, personally identifiable information)
							  with subsidiaries and affiliates of PROVIDERS.<br><br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>Business Transfers:</b></font> The Site or a PROVIDER may be sold
  							along with its assets, or other transactions may occur in which your personally
 							 identifiable information is one of the business assets transferred. In such
 							 a case, your personally identifiable information, which we have gathered, may
 							 be one of the business assets we transfer.<br><br>

							<font color="#003399"><b>Legal Process:</b></font> In the event we are required to respond
  							to subpoenas, court orders or other legal process your personally identifiable
 							 information may be disclosed pursuant to such subpoena, court order or legal
							  process, which may be without notice to you. <br><br>

							<span class="title3">CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND MESSAGE BOARDS</span><br>
							The Site may make chat rooms, forums and message boards available
							  to its users. You are not required to provide any personal information when
 							 using these areas but you may choose to do so. If you post personal information
 							 online, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages
  							from other parties. The PROVIDERS cannot ensure the security of any information
  							you choose to make public in a chat room, forum, or message board. Also, we
  							cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information
 							will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose
  							personal information in these areas.<br><br>

							<span class="title3">LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES</span><br>
							This privacy policy applies only to this Site. When you are on
 							 the Site you could be directed to other sites beyond our control. For example,
 							 if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may
 							 take you off the Site onto a different Web site. This includes links from advertisers,
  							sponsors and others that may use the Site's logo as part of a cobranding agreement.
  							These other Web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect
  							data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published
  							privacy policies. If you visit a Website that is linked to our Site, you should
 							 consult that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information.<br><br>

							<span class="title3">SECURITY</span><br>
							This Site incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security,
 							integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the personal information that
  							we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions to protect
  							such information from loss, misuse and alteration. Certain personally identifiable
 							 information, such as credit card information, is transferred to our computers
 							 utilizing encryption software. Only those employees who need access to your
 							 information in order to do their jobs are allowed access. Our security policies
 							 are reviewed periodically and revised as required.<br><br>

							<span class="title3">A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS CONCERNING PRIVACY</span><br>
							The Site is a general audience site. We do not currently collect
 							 any personal information from children under the age of thirteen on the Site.
							  If in the future, the PROVIDERS knowingly collect personally identifiable information
  							from children, we will do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy
 							 Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) including, without limitation,
 							 obtaining necessary parental consents. We encourage you to visit the
  							<a href="http://www.the-dma.org" target="top">Direct Marketing Association's</a> web site
  							and explore the Get CyberSavvy! Program as well as the <a href="http://www.getnetwise.org" target="top">GetNetWise</a> web site to learn more about parental control tools.<br><br>

							<span class="title3">NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES AND YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY</span><br>
							By using this Site, you signify your agreement to the terms of
 							 this privacy policy. If we decide to change or update this privacy policy, we
  							will post the change or update here. If at any point we decide to use personally
  							identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time
 							 it was collected, we will notify you by way of an email or some other means.
 							 Your continued use of the Site shall constitute your acceptance of such revised
 							privacy policy.<br><br>

							<span class="title3">CORRECTION/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</span><br>
          If your personally identifiable information (such as your address) changes
          or if you no longer desire to access our Site, you may correct, update
          or remove the personal data you have provided to us by using an opt
          out message in an email. If you have any questions about this privacy
          policy or the privacy practices of this Site, you can contact: <a href="mailto:feedback@fans.panthers.com">
