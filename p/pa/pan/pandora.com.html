	<p><b>PANDORA TERMS OF USE</b></p>
	</center>

	<p>To make it a bit easier to digest our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, we thought we'd start by highlighting in plain English some of the issues. This summary is not a legal document.  Of course you'll want to read the complete Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, but here's what we think is important:</p>

	<p><b>Terms:</b>
	</p><ul>
		<li>Thanks to the way our music licensing works, you have to live in the United States to use Pandora. You also have to be at least 13 years old.   Pandora can only be used if you are in the United States.</li>
		<li>We expect you to keep your account password to yourself</li>
		<li>Pandora is for personal use only, that means you can't play Pandora for the patrons in your bar, coffee shop, etc.</li>
		<li>You can't use Pandora to steal music, and you have to listen to it through pandora.com or on a device officially supported by Pandora</li>
		<li>Do not use Pandora if you do not agree to the Terms of Use.  Your use of Pandora means you agree to the Terms of Use.</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<p>Read Pandora's full <a href="http://www.pandora.com/legal">Terms of Use</a>.


	</p><p><b>Privacy:</b>
	</p><ul>
		<li>We'll only send you emails if you sign up. We'll never give or sell your email address to another company for marketing purposes. We hate spam as much as you do.</li>

		<li>If you come to Pandora directly from a partner site, we may share your information back with the partner that sent you to Pandora. If that's the case, we'll tell you onscreen that we're going to do so.</li>

		<li>If you decide to publicly post your personal information in our community sections, we can't be responsible for what happens to that information. Post wisely.</li>

		<li>We track the music played on Pandora so we can make sure artists get paid. We must report on listening in aggregate to music rightsholders, but we never report on what you individually are listening to.</li>

		<li>To personalize advertising we may pass along your age, gender, geographic region, or the kind of music you like to our advertising service provider so the ad server can personalize the ads for you.</li>

		<li>Our advertising system, like just about every ad system on the web, uses cookies to keep track of the ads you've already seen and to target ads to what we hope are your interests.</li>

	</ul>

<p><b>PANDORA MEDIA, INC.<br>
PRIVACY POLICY<br>
(EFFECTIVE AS OF APRIL 18, 2010)</b></p>
</center>


<p>This is the privacy policy ("Privacy Policy"), effective as of April 18, 2010, for Pandora Media, Inc. ("Pandora", "we", "us" or "our"). This Privacy Policy sets forth our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of certain information relating to your use of Pandora streaming music service (the "Pandora Services"), including but not limited to delivery via our Web site [http://www.pandora.com] (the "Site"), a mobile device, or otherwise. </p>

<p>We recognize the importance of protecting your privacy and our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us, and to assist you in making informed decisions when using the Pandora Services. This Privacy Policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs. As we update and diversify our services, this Privacy Policy may evolve. Please check this page for updates periodically. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email or by means of a notice on our Site's home page that you must view to access the Pandora Services.</p>

<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or wish to exclude your personal information from our direct marketing, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto: privacy@pandora.com">privacy@pandora.com</a> or by writing to us at Attn: Privacy Officer, Pandora Media, Inc., 2101 Webster Street, Suite 1650 Oakland, CA 94612.</p>

<p><b>The types of information we collect</b></p>

<p>We have several areas where you can submit information to us, and we also have features that automatically collect information from the users of the Pandora Services and visitors to our Site.</p>

<p><b>Information voluntarily provided by you</b></p>

<p>Registration: With the exception of our Site's demonstration mode, you must register with us to use our free ad-supported version of the Pandora Services or the subscription version of the Pandora Services. We may also offer options for you to sign up for our newsletters without having to subscribe to the Pandora Service. During registration to the Pandora Services, you must provide your email address, year of birth, gender and zip code and you must supply a password to us. It is your responsibility to keep your password strictly confidential. In addition, in order to subscribe to Pandora Services, you must provide your name and a valid credit card number, along with your credit card's security code and expiration date as well as the zip code to which your credit card statement is sent to you.</p>

<p><b>Communications from Pandora and our newsletters</b>: In order to keep our registered users and subscribers informed about the Pandora Services' latest developments and features, we may send messages to your personal email address, or for subscribers to mobile Services, to your mobile telephone number, that you provided to us while registering for the Pandora Services.  If you elected to opt in to our email list, we may also send newsletters or promotional emails to you. You are always free to change your email preferences by following the instructions provided in the "Edit Your Account Info" section of the Site. In the event we send you a promotional e-mail, each such email will include instructions detailing how you may unsubscribe from our mailing list.</p>

<p><b>Contacting Us</b>: You are always free to contact us with a question or problem related to your use of the Pandora Services. Our standard business practice is to retain any communications from our registered Pandora Services users, subscribers and Site visitors to help us to serve each of you better.</p><p>

</p><p><b>Emailing your friends through our Site</b>: Currently, the Site allows you to email your friends and allow them to listen to the stations you create provided they know your email address. In order for us to provide this feature, we will keep copies of your emailed messages. We may decide, but are not obligated, to monitor your email messages through computer software or human personnel to check for obscenity, defamation or other types of abusive language, as well as for content that may infringe our rights or the rights of others, all of which we may remove at any time in our sole discretion. Ordinarily, we will not otherwise access your emailed messages except in unusual cases, including but not limited to times when we receive specific complaints related to a particular emailed message or are compelled to do so by law. For administrative purposes we intend to keep an email log that includes a record of which registered users and subscribers sent email messages and to which email addresses they were sent. We will use the addressee information you enter only to send the emails you request.</p>

<p><b>Station Sharing</b>: We also offer Site-wide community features designed to help other registered users and subscribers find music they like, by making available a registered user's or subscriber's station either in an anonymous form or to registered users or subscribers who know your email address and specifically request your station by entering your email address in the applicable field on our Site. Registered users and subscribers may also access features such as message boards that allow other registered users and subscribers to communicate with each other. Any information that you send or post via our Site's community features will be considered public information and we cannot be held responsible for any information you choose to make public. We may, but are not obligated to, monitor our Site's community features through computer software or human personnel to check for obscenity, defamation or other types of abusive language, or for content that may infringe our rights or the rights of others, all of which we may remove at any time.</p>

<p><b>Personal Pages</b>: You may have the opportunity to post favorite songs, stations or other information on personal pages. These personal pages may be made available to other registered users and subscribers as part of the Pandora Services. The information you post to such personal pages, therefore, may be viewed by visitors to such pages. Your personal page will be identified to others by the local-part of the email address you provide to us (i.e., the part of your email address before the "@" sign) either alone or in combination with additional numbers or letters. Thus, to the extent that your email address includes personal information (such as your full name), this information may be displayed to other registered users and subscribers. In addition, to the extent that you post other personal information on your personal page, this information may also be viewed by other registered users and subscribers.</p>

<p><b>Third-party information provided to us by partners</b>: We may receive information about you from third parties, such as business partners that make features available through the Pandora Services, business partners through whom we allow registered users to access Pandora Services, advertisers or marketing companies, other web sites or applications that you have registered to use, or that people you know have registered to use, when we allow those web sites or applications to interact through Pandora Services to provide social networking services to you (collectively, "Partners").</p>

<p><b>Links</b>: When using our Pandora Services, you may click through certain links or promotions that will enable you to purchase products or use services provided by our Partners. Some of these Partners may share certain information that you provide to them with us. By clicking on and through to a link or promotion via the Pandora Services, you agree to allow us to receive and use any information (except for credit card information) that you may provide to our Partners, under the same terms and conditions as if you provided your information directly to us. We are not, however, responsible for any other Web sites or services, or their respective privacy policies or how they treat information about their members. We strongly advise you to check their privacy policies to find out how they are treating your personal information.</p>

<p><b>Third Party Usage</b>: You may also separately share your information with other Web sites or entities, such as those that create professional marketing lists, to receive special offers and promotions from their affiliates. These Web sites or entities may agree to share your information with us. Whether or not any third party actually shares your information with us and to what extent they do share your information with us will depend on their agreement with us and their respective privacy policies. <b>Marketing Data</b>: We may purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers in which we think you would be interested. We may also associate this marketing data to the personally identifiable information they have provided to us.</p>

<p>Pandora is not responsible for, and will assume no liability, if a Partner or other Web site or entity collects, uses or shares, any information about you in violation of its own privacy policy, or applicable law.</p>


<p><b>Automatic Data Collection</b></p>

<p><b>Copyright Tracking</b>: In an effort to optimize Pandora Services and user experience, we may, from time to time, provide updates, fixes or support, as we deem appropriate. Pandora incorporates software that is designed to protect the copyrights associated with the tracks you listen to. In order to make sure that artists and copyright owners receive applicable royalties, this software identifies and counts the songs you have accessed. At the aggregate level (i.e., not tied to the personal information of any user), we use this data to report and pay royalties, for internal analysis and we share this data with certain Partners for their own analysis. We do not share your personal usage data with any third parties. We may use your personal usage data for a variety of Pandora Services-related purposes including, without limitation, for displaying advertising to users of the free ad-supported version of the Pandora Services.</p>

<p>Partner Access: When you access the Pandora Services through a Partner, we may add select aspects of your registration information (such as your email address and, if applicable, the Partner or promotion through which you registered) to the registry settings on your computer's hard drive, so that we can recognize which of our Partners or other sign-in pages to send to you when you log on to the Pandora Services.</p>

<p><b>Cookies</b>: We use what are commonly called "cookies," a small data string our server writes to your hard drive, which allow Pandora to identify you as a valid registered user or subscriber so that we can deliver music to you, to ensure that no one else can sign on simultaneously with your account from another computer or device and to help us serve you better based on your registration preferences (such as your preferences with regard to what types of music you would like to receive). We may also use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your visits to help us facilitate any promotions or surveys that we provide as well as the delivery of advertising to users of the free version of the Pandora Services. In addition, we may also use cookies in connection with a sign-in feature that allows you to save your email address and password each subsequent time you sign in and to track your use of free trial features.</p>

<p><b>Advertiser Cookies</b>: We also use a third party advertising company, DoubleClick, to deliver ads to you when you use the Pandora Services. In the course of providing this service, our third-party advertising company may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser which collects non-personally identifiable information about your visits to Pandora, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personal information). If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by our third party advertising company, please click here: <a href=" http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy ">http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy</a>.</p>

<p><b>Performance tracking</b>: We sometimes use cookies, as well as tracking technology, such as web beacons, within the promotional emails that we send to our registered users and subscribers. These performance tracking devices help us to track whether an e-mail recipient has completed an event, such as signing up for a free trial for example. Such information is non-personally identifying and collected on an aggregate level. We sometimes utilize third-party service providers to help us track the activity within our Pandora Services. These third parties may use temporary cookies and/or web beaconing technology to facilitate such tracking, but the data would not be tracked in a personally identifiable way. Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Pandora Services may also use cookies, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other privacy practices.</p>

<p><b>Other types of information collected</b>: In order to better improve the Pandora Services, we capture other data such as a registered user's or subscriber's search criteria and results, date, time, connection speed and the IP address of each registered Pandora Services user, subscriber and Site visitor. We keep this information for our internal security audit log, aggregate trend analysis, and system administration.</p>

<p><b>When and with whom we may share your information</b></p>

<p>Other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not share your personal information with other companies. While we may use personal information (such as age, gender or personal usage data) to display advertising to registered users of the ad-supported version of the Pandora Services, we do not share personal information with our advertisers.</p>

<p><b>Partners</b>: If you access the Pandora Services through a Partner, we may share your registration information (such as your email address, year of birth, zip code and gender) with our Partner that you registered with for the Pandora Services.</p>

<p><b>Vendors</b>: We will share your personal information with companies acting as our agents in providing our service (e.g., credit card processing, customer/support services) to you, all of whom agree to use it only for such specified purposes. Each vendor must also agree to keep your personal information reasonably secure and confidential in accordance with applicable laws.</p>

<p><b>Legally affiliated entities</b>: In the event that Pandora is merged with another entity, or in the event of a transfer of our assets, Site or operations, Pandora may disclose or transfer your personal information in connection with such transaction. In the event of such a transfer, Pandora will notify you via email or by posting a prominent notice via the Pandora Services for 30 days of any such change in ownership of Pandora resulting in a change of control of your personal information. <b>Legally compelled disclosure</b>: We will also disclose your personal information when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing your personal information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (whether intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property and users of the Pandora Services or members of the public.</p>

<p><b>Bankruptcy</b>: You should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, may have the authority under certain circumstances to permit your personal information to be shared or transferred to third parties without your permission.</p>

<p><b>Consent to processing</b>: Use of Pandora outside of the United States is a violation of our <a href="http://www.pandora.com/legal">Terms of Use</a>.  If you should nonetheless use Pandora outside of the United States, by providing any personal information to us, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to the transfer of such personal information to, and the collection and processing of such personal information in, the United States and other countries or territories. Your personal information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal information in the United States may vary and be less stringent than laws of your state or country. </p>

<p><b>Security</b></p>

<p>Pandora endeavors to protect the security of your personal information and your choices for its intended use. We use secure SSL technology to protect the transmission of sensitive personal information such as your credit card number. We store your personal information on a secure server, and use procedures designed to protect the personal information we collect from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.</p>

<p>Although we will take (and require our third-party providers to take) commercially reasonable security precautions regarding your personal information collected from and stored by the Pandora Services, due to the open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that any of your personal information stored on our servers, or transmitted to or from a user, will be free from unauthorized access, and we disclaim any liability for any theft or loss of, unauthorized access or damage to, or interception of any data or communications. By using the Pandora Services, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.</p>

<p>Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this reason, we request that you do not send any personal information to us by email. However, doing so is allowed, but at your own risk. We follow commercially reasonable security precautions to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during the transmission and once we receive it.</p>

<p><b>Compromise of personal information</b></p>

<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Pandora will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>

<p><b>Modification of your choices and preferences</b></p>

<p>You may modify your registration information at any time by following the instructions provided in the account management area of our Site.  In addition, you may call us at 877-436-6632 and we may record your call for quality assurance and improving customer service purposes. Any promotional e-mail from Pandora will come with instructions for unsubscribing from Pandora's email mailing list. Registered users and Subscribers may also contact one of our listener support representatives by email at <a href="mailto:pandora-support@pandora.com">pandora-support@pandora.com</a> and we will strive to respond to you within a maximum of 72 hours from our receipt.</p>

<p><b>Opt-out right:</b></p>

<p>If you have elected to receive newsletters or promotional or marketing correspondence from us previously and later decide that you no longer wish to receive such correspondence from us in the future, you may opt-out from further receipt by sending an email to <a href="mailto:opt-out@pandora.com">opt-out@pandora.com</a> or by following the opt-out instructions provided in such correspondence. (If you use more than one email address, then send your opt-out email from each of your email addresses.)  You may opt out of receiving mobile text messages by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@pandora.com">support@pandora.com</a>.  You can also opt out of mobile text messages and/or non-Service-related emails by sending mail to the following postal address:</p>
<p style="margin-left:30px;">Customer Support<br>
Pandora Media, Inc.  <br>
2101 Webster Street<br>
Suite 1650<br>
Oakland, CA  94612</p>

<p>Your election not to receive newsletters, mobile text messages, or promotional and marketing correspondence from us will not: (a) preclude us from corresponding with you, by email or otherwise, regarding your existing or past relationship with us, and (b) preclude us, including our employees, contractors, agents and other representatives, from accessing and viewing your personal information in the course of maintaining and improving the Pandora Services.</p>

<p><b>Notification procedures</b></p>

<p>It is Pandora's policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to users via email, mobile text message, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our Site, as determined by Pandora in its sole discretion. Pandora reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy:</b></p>

<p>If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Pandora Services. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this Privacy Policy at any time, so visitors are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy from time to time. </p>
