	<p><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b>
	</p></center>
	<ul>
		<li>The purpose of the Pandora Privacy Policy is to inform our listeners about the information that Pandora collects, how Pandora uses that information and how listeners can control how that information is used or shared. To make it a bit easier to digest our Privacy Policy, we want to highlight some key issues to keep in mind about our data collection and use practices. For information about listeners' obligations and use of Pandora, please see our Terms of Use.</li>
		<li>You have significant control over the information that is shared with other Pandora users and the public through the privacy settings for your profile.</li>
		<li>We do not sell or give your email address to other companies for their marketing purposes.</li>
		<li>Post wisely: Information that you post in our community and social networking features is available to members of the public.</li>
		<li>We use the information that we collect and you provide about yourself to personalize your Pandora experience through ads and social networking features.</li>
		<li>We track the music played on Pandora so that we can make sure artists and copyright owners get paid. We must report on listening in aggregate to music licensing agencies. These reports do not contain individual listener data.</li>
		<li>Your stations are always available to the public; however, if you make your profile private, your profile will not be linked to your station list. Members of the public who enter your email address into our search system may be able to see information about your stations and to listen to them.</li>
	</ul>
		
	<p>This summary is not the complete picture, so please read the Pandora Privacy Policy below in its entirety to learn more about the information that Pandora collects, how Pandora uses and shares this information, and your options to control how that information is used or shared.

</p><center>
<p><b>PANDORA MEDIA, INC.<br>
PRIVACY POLICY<br>
(EFFECTIVE AS OF August 8, 2010)</b></p>
</center>


<p>This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") is effective as of August 3, 2010, for Pandora Media, Inc. ("Pandora", "we", "us" or "our"). It applies to the United States operations for the Internet radio services that we offer through our web site located at www.pandora.com, supported mobile devices, consumer electronics devices and other mechanisms (collectively, the "Pandora Services").

</p><p>We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy against new technologies, business practices, and our listeners' needs, and may make changes to the Privacy Policy accordingly. Please check this page periodically for updates. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy here and notify you by email or by means of a notice on our website's home page. 

</p><p><b>The types of information we collect</b>

</p><p>We have several areas where you can submit information to us, and we also have features that automatically collect information from the listeners of the Pandora Services and visitors to our Site.

</p><p><u>Information you give us:</u>

</p><p style="margin-left:20px;">To enable you to enjoy certain features of the Pandora Services, we may collect certain types of information, including personally identifiable information, during your interactions with the Pandora Services. For example, we may collect information when you:
</p><ul>
	<li>Register to use the Pandora Services;</li>
	<li>Enter information in your Profile Page, including your friends lists;</li>
	<li>Post comments on other Pandora listeners' pages or use other community and social networking features that are part of the Pandora Services;</li>
	<li>Participate in polls, contests, or other features of the Pandora Services; and</li>
	<li>Sign up to receive email newsletters.</li>
</ul>
	
<p style="margin-left:20px;">When you register, we ask you to provide your email address, birth year, gender, and zip code, as well as a password for your listener account. If you choose to subscribe to fee-based portions of the Pandora Services, you will also be asked to provide your name, credit card information, and zip code. When you contact us by email, we retain the emails that you send to us. 

</p><p><u>Information we receive from third parties</u>

</p><p style="margin-left:20px;">We may receive information about you from third parties and store it in our databases with other information (including personally identifiable information) that you provide to us. Some examples of these third parties are listed below:

</p><ul>
	<li>Service partners and advertisers that make features available through the Pandora Services;</li>
	<li>Service partners through whom we allow registered listeners to access Pandora Services;</li>
	<li>Marketing companies that create professional marketing lists or sell other marketing data;</li>
	<li>Other websites or applications that you have registered to use, or that people you know have registered to use, when we allow those websites or applications to interact through Pandora Services to provide personalized services to you. In some cases, those websites or applications may automatically provide us with information about you to facilitate personalization unless you use the controls available on those websites or applications to opt-out of such sharing.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">Pandora is not responsible for, and will assume no liability, if a business partner or other entity collects, uses or shares any information about you in violation of its own privacy policy or applicable law.

</p><p><u>Information that we receive from other listeners</u>
</p><p style="margin-left:20px;">We may collect information about you from people who have stored information about you when they elect to use our social networking or community features, or when they enable connectivity with another website or application where they have stored such information. For instance, your friends may have stored information about you in places such as their friends lists, address books, or photos on our site and other sites with which Pandora interacts.

</p><p style="margin-left:20px;">We may also collect your email address when people you know share a station with you, but we will not add your name to any of our mailing lists as a result of this feature.

</p><p><u>Automatic Data Collection</u>

</p><p style="margin-left:20px;"><i>Copyright Tracking:</i> Pandora incorporates software that is designed to protect the copyrights associated with the tracks you listen to and to ensure that artists and copyright owners receive applicable royalties. This software identifies and counts the songs you have accessed.

</p><p style="margin-left:20px;"><i>Service partners:</i> When you access the Pandora Services through a service partner, we may add select aspects of your registration information (such as your email address), so that we can recognize to which of our Partners or other sign-in pages to send to you when you log on to the Pandora Services.

</p><p style="margin-left:20px;"><i>Tracking technology:</i> We use what are commonly called "cookies," a small data string our server writes to your hard drive, and other tracking technology (such as Flash Persistent Storage) to help us manage and track your interaction with Pandora Services. These technologies collect non-personally identifiable information to improve Pandora Services to keep count of return visits to our site or our advertisers' or partners' sites, collect and report on aggregate statistical information, save your password and login information, and / or display advertising or content based on your interests. We may also capture other data such as search criteria and results, date, time, connection speed and IP addresses. 
Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Pandora Services may also use cookies, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other privacy practices.

</p><p style="margin-left:20px;">We also use third party advertising companies, such as DoubleClick, to deliver ads to you when you use the Pandora Services. In the course of providing this service, our third-party advertising companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser which collects non-personally identifiable information about your visits to Pandora, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personally identifiable information). If you would like more information about this practice and how to control how this information is used by Doubleclick, please click here: <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx</a>. 

</p><p><b>How we use the information we collect:</b>

</p><p>We use the information that we collect for the following purposes:

</p><ol>
	<li>To customize and personalize the advertising and the content you see.</li>
	<li>To enhance the listener experience in our network of sites. We use tracking information to determine how well each page and station performs overall based on aggregate listener demographics and traffic patterns to those pages and stations. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.</li>
	<li>To fulfill your requests for certain products and services, such as sending out electronic newsletters and enabling you to participate in and renew paid services, polls, contests, and message boards.</li>
	<li>To send you information that you agreed to receive about topics that we think will be of interest to you.</li>
	<li>To alert you to Pandora Services' latest developments and features.</li>
</ol>
	
<p>We also may use and share non-personally identifiable information. The use and disclosure of such information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy. Additionally, we may de-identify personally identifiable information and share it in a de-identified or aggregated form with third parties, advertisers and/or business partners in order to analyze site usage, improve the Pandora Services and your listener experience, or for other similar purposes.

</p><p><b>How the information we collect is shared:</b>

</p><p>We will make your personally identifiable information available to other companies, websites, applications or people in the circumstances listed below.

</p><ol>
	<li>You provide information in the course of your use of the Pandora Services by participating in community and social networking features such as forums, station sharing, listener opinions and reviews, or other forms of public communication and interaction. In addition, we also make your stations available to those registered listeners who know your email address and who specifically request your station.</li>
	<li>You elect to allow us to share information at the time that you register with us or provide us with the information, or through a subsequent affirmative election.</li>
	<li>When we hire or partner with third parties to provide specialized services on our behalf, such as credit card processing, sweepstakes management and prize fulfillment, data processing, customer/support services and special products or services that we choose to make available to our registered listeners.</li>
	<li>When you search for artists or listen to stations via the Services. Unless you make your Profile Private, information about the artists, songs, and stations you have created or listened to may be made publically available.</li>
	<li>When we jointly offer certain features or services with third parties, such as service partners that make features available through the Pandora Services, business partners through whom we allow registered listeners to access Pandora Services, advertisers, or marketing companies. When you use these features or services, you grant us permission to pass your Pandora registration information back to that service partner. Their use of your information is subject to their applicable privacy policies.</li>
	<li>When we work with a third party to provide personalization to the Pandora Services through connectivity to another website or application. We may also share your information with a third party when we jointly offer a service or a feature with that third party, such as connectivity with other websites.</li>
	<li>If you unsubscribe for a mailing that we send to you on behalf of a third party, we may share your removal instructions with the third party so that your email address may be added to that company's list of people to whom they will not send emails directly.</li>
	<li>In connection with a merger with another entity, or in the event of a transfer of all or some of our assets.</li>
	<li>When we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so by law or in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or in a situation where disclosing your personal information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to Pandora, our listeners or members of the public.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:20px;"><u>How your information may be shared with other listeners and the public</u>

</p><p style="margin-left:20px;">Unless you make your Profile Page private, information on that page is visible to other listeners and to the public. You may post favorite songs, bookmarks, stations or other biographical information on your Profile Page.  When you are making the decision to be public or private, please keep in mind that as a result of our partnerships, including, Facebook's Instant Personalization, some of the people who may be looking at your profile or your Pandora activities may be your Pandora friends, or your friends on other social networks, including Facebook.

</p><p><b>How we protect your information</b>

</p><p>We have implemented commercially reasonable physical and electronic security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your personally identifiable information. Despite our best efforts, however, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

</p><p><b>Consent to processing</b>

</p><p>Use of Pandora outside of the United States is a violation of our <a href="/legal">Terms of Use</a>. Nevertheless, if you use Pandora outside of the United States, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to the transfer of such personal information to, and the collection and processing of such personal information in the United States and other countries or territories. The laws on holding personal information in the United States may vary and be less stringent than laws of your state or country.

If you use more than one email address, then send your opt-out email from each of your email addresses.

</p><p>Registered listeners may also contact one of our listener support representatives by email at <a href="mailto:pandora-support@pandora.com">pandora-support@pandora.com</a>.

</p><p>Your election not to receive newsletters, promotional and marketing correspondence, and other notices from us will not preclude us (including our employees, contractors, agents and other representatives) (a) from corresponding with you, by email or otherwise, regarding your existing or past relationship with us, or (b) including our employees, contractors, agents and other representatives, from accessing and viewing your personal information in the course of maintaining and improving the Pandora Services.
