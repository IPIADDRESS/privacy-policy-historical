Information about particular transactions, such as product purchases, is maintained in our databases in the same or 
similar manner as such information is maintained for transactions which are done by telephone, fax, etc. This information
is used by us for ordinary business purposes, such as order processing, delivery, etc. We sometimes also use this data 
to establish a profile for your company, or collectively for some or all of our customers, to help us with strategic and 
tactical business decisions, such as what kinds of new products we should be developing. Without your consent, we will 
not make any profile that can identify you personally. <br>
