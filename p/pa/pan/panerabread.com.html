<h1>Your Privacy</h1>


<div id="content">

<p><strong>Please note — this policy has been updated.</strong></p>

<p>We at Panera Bread  know that privacy is a major concern of visitors to our web site ("Site"). This policy describes the personal information we collect on our Site, how we use it, and when we share it with third parties. This policy applies only to personal information collected via this Site, and does not apply to personal information collected offline (such as information you may provide over the phone, via fax, or when visiting a PANERA BREAD bakery-cafe or any other website).</p>

<p>By using this Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy and to the <a href="/legal/terms.php" title="View the www.panerabread.com Terms of Use">Terms and Conditions</a> governing its use. If you have questions, comments or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@panerabread.com?subject=The%20Panerabread.com%20Privacy%20Policy" title="Send us an email">webmaster@panerabread.com</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that the headings contained in this Privacy Policy are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not in any way define or affect the meaning, construction, or scope of any of the provisions contained in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3 class="p">Our Business Structure</h3>

<p>You know us as Panera or Panera Bread. Our operating company is Panera, LLC, which is wholly owned by Panera Bread Company, a Nasdaq listed company (Nasdaq: PNRA). Throughout this policy and this Site we will make reference to Panera Bread or the Company, which shall refer to Panera Bread Company, Panera, LLC and/or one or more of their affiliated companies, as the case may be.</p>

<p>The PANERA BREAD name, design, logos and related marks are trademarks or registered trademarks of the Company. PANERA BREAD bakery-cafes are owned and operated either by the Company or by independent franchisees. The Company licenses independent franchisees to provide PANERA BREAD products and services to the public. We may allow PANERA BREAD franchisees to operate web sites separately from this Site if they choose to do so. This Privacy Policy applies only to this Site, not to the separate web sites of PANERA BREAD, or PANERA BREAD franchisees. Panera Bread assumes no responsibility for the privacy practices of our franchisees in their handling of your personal information they collect from you online or offline. If you have questions or concerns about the web site of a PANERA BREAD franchisee, please contact that franchisee directly. If you need assistance reaching a franchisee, please contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@panerabread.com?subject=Need%20Assistance%20Reaching%20a%20Franchisee" title="Send us an email">webmaster@panerabread.com</a> or see the For More Information section below.</p>

<h3 class="p">Information We Collect and How We Use It</h3>

<p>You do not have to provide any personal information to us in order to use our Site. You control how much or how little personal information you submit to us. You can send us your personal information in a variety of ways. If you communicate with us by email or through an online form on this Site, we will collect your name, email address, and the additional information that you provide. Online forms permit you to, among other things, subscribe to Panera Bread e-newsletters, provide us feedback, and ask questions. Participating in some online services may require you to register. For example, we ask you to register before accessing our webcasts concerning quarterly earnings. We use this information in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>To provide you with the information and/or services that you have requested, such as your request to receive Panera Bread e-newsletters or to identify a Panera Bread bakery-cafe near your home.</li>
<li>To enhance our customers' experiences in our bakery-cafes and on our Site.</li>
<li>To learn more about potential investors in our company, and to allow you to ask questions and receive responses during our webcasts for investors.</li>
<li>To measure the effectiveness of our online and offline marketing efforts and to develop products, services, and marketing programs. This analysis may include combining personal data drawn from online and offline sources.</li>
</ul>

<p>We use third party suppliers and service providers to facilitate our Site and may make personal information available to them to the extent necessary for them to host our Site or to provide other services to Panera Bread. Whenever we do this, we require that our third party suppliers and service providers agree to maintain the confidentiality of the personal information we provide to them.</p>

<p>We do not sell or rent to third parties any of the personal information that consumers and investors provide to us online, but we may share your information with our affiliates, our PANERA BREAD franchisees, and/or lenders to and/or investors in our company. Primarily, we share information with these third parties only to respond to your specific request or to obtain their advice on how to improve our business. We do not authorize third parties unaffiliated with Panera Bread to make independent use of your information for their own purposes, such as for direct marketing.</p>

<h3 class="p">Gift Cards</h3>

<p>We use a third party service provider to facilitate the gift card service that we make available to you. The information that you submit while placing a gift card order ("Gift Card Information"), including your name, address, email address, phone number and credit card information, is collected by our third party gift card service provider. Panera Bread does not collect or store your Gift Card Information and will not share this information with other third parties. We require our gift card service provider to maintain the confidentiality of the Gift Card Information that you submit and to use the Gift Card  Information only for purposes related to fulfilling and tracking your order, providing you with related customer service and for reporting purposes. Please review the privacy policy on the gift card service site for specific information. We also require our gift card service provider to maintain your Gift Card Information on a secure server and to use at least industry standard encryption technology and security procedures for all payment processing. Please also see the <a href="#links">Links to Other Sites</a> section below.</p>

<h3 class="p">Franchise Inquiries</h3>

<p>All information submitted to Panera Bread on our <a href="/about/franchise/inquiry.php" title="Complete our franchise inquiry form">franchise inquiry form</a> is used only to assist in the screening of potential franchisees and will be kept confidential.</p>

<p>On the franchise inquiry form, we will collect your name, address, email address, other contact information, and certain financial information and qualifications information that you must enter on the form. By submitting this information, you agree that Panera Bread may retain and use the information to respond to your inquiry and to help us improve our franchise marketing efforts. Information on your online form will become part of any application for a PANERA BREAD franchise that you might later submit. We may disclose your personal information to our business units, agents, affiliates and to other third parties as part of our consideration of any subsequent franchise application. We do not authorize unaffiliated third parties to use your personal information for any purpose other than consideration of your application.</p>

<h3 class="p">Contests</h3>

<p>On occasion, Panera Bread may conduct contests with the opportunity to win prizes.  Each contest has its own terms and conditions ("Official Contest Rules").  As part of entering a contest on-line, certain personally identifiable information (such as name, address, phone number, etc.) may be required. This information will be used as described in the applicable Official Contest Rules.</p>

<h3 class="p">Discount Coupons</h3>

<p>This Site may allow you to obtain a digital version of a Panera Bread Discount Coupon(s), which can be printed from this Site and redeemed at any participating Panera Bread location in the United States during the dates specified on the particular coupon. To obtain the coupon(s), you must submit your zip code or bakery-cafe location via an online form. This information will only be used to track the number of coupons being downloaded by zip code or bakery-cafe in order to allow Panera Bread bakery-cafes to adequately plan for coupon redemption. There is no limit to the number of coupons you can obtain from this Site, however applicable terms and conditions appear on the coupon itself.</p>

<h3 class="p">Job Application Information</h3>

<p>We do not collect employment application information through this Site at this time. We do, however, use a third party supplier to collect résumés online (See Links to Other Sites provisions below). You may, however, fax your résumé to us at (314) 633-7200. We protect the confidentiality of such information, but this online Privacy Policy does not apply to such faxes because they occur offline.</p>

<h3 class="p">Press Information</h3>

<p>If you are a member of the press, Panera Bread will collect your name and contact information in order to respond to your <a href="/about/press/inquiry.php" title="Complete our media inquiry form">inquiry</a> submitted on our Press Room web page. We may store your personal information and inquiries for future reference.</p>

<h3 class="p">Site Usage Information</h3>

<p>Like most web sites, this Site gathers traffic patterns, site usage information and other aggregated data in order to evaluate our visitors' preferences and the effectiveness of our Site. This aggregate usage data does not identify you individually. We may share anonymous, aggregated statistics about visitors to our Site with others outside our company, or we may allow third-parties to collect aggregate data through our Site. Our Site does not use web beacons.</p>

<p>This Site may use cookies to enhance the browsing and usage experience on our Site. "Cookies" are small files or records that are placed on your computer's hard drive (by us or a third party provider of ours) to collect information about your activities on our Site. The information captured about your activities on our Site will make it possible for us (i) to speed navigation and provide you with custom tailored content; (ii) to remember information you gave to us so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site; (iii) to monitor the effectiveness of certain of our marketing email campaigns; (iv) to monitor total number of visitors, pages viewed, and banners served on our Site, and (v) enforce limitations on downloads described for on-line coupons and other similar offers. If you refuse cookies, your experience on our Site may be affected — for example you may not be able to utilize all of the functions on this Site.</p>

<h3 class="p">Protecting Our Community</h3>

<p>The law requires that we may be required to share your personal information and non-personal information pursuant to judicial or governmental subpoenas, warrants or orders. If we are required to do so, we will, of course, obey the law.
In addition, notwithstanding any term to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we reserve the right to use and disclose your personal and non-personal information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of this Site’s Terms and Conditions statement, or as otherwise required by law.</p>

<h3 class="p">Children's Privacy</h3>

<p>Panera Bread recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of children. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen years. This Site is directed to adults at least eighteen years old, and when a user discloses personal information on this Site, the user is representing to us that he or she is an adult. If a child has provided this Site with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian e-mail us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@panerabread.com?subject=Childrens%20Privacy" title="Send email to webmaster@panerabread.com">webmaster@panerabread.com</a>, and we will promptly delete the child's information from our records.</p>

<h3 class="p">Security of Your Personal Information</h3>

<p>Panera Bread operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protected systems, and maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard the integrity and privacy of these servers and of your Personal Information. Although we can't guarantee that there will never be a security problem, we and our agents that have access to your information carefully guard against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information we collect on our Site.</p>
