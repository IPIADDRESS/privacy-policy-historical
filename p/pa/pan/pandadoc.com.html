<h3>1.2 Non-Personal Information</h3>
<p>“Non-Personal Information” is general user information that does not contain personally identifiable information, which is collected on an aggregate basis as you use our Website.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We collect Non-Personal Information such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cookies</strong>: We use cookies and web log files to track usage and trends, to improve the quality of our Service and to customize your experience.&nbsp; A “cookie” is a tiny data file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows PandaDoc to recognize you as a user when you return to our Website using the same computer and web browser.&nbsp; Information gathered through cookies may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, and time spent at our Website. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use our Website. &nbsp;Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal information about that user and keep a record of the user’s preferences when utilizing our services, both on an individual and aggregate basis. For example, the Company may use cookies to store the following information: session data, email address, username, and preferences. PandaDoc may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics Data</strong>:&nbsp;We use third party analytics services to help analyze how users use the Website. These analytics services use cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Website and we use the information to improve the Website. The analytics services ability to use and share information collected by them is restricted by their terms of use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information about how these entities use this information.&nbsp; If third party services collect information, they do so anonymously without identifying individual visitors.&nbsp; However, we may link the information we record using tracking technology to Personal Information we collect.</li>
<li><strong>Device Data</strong>: We use device data, which is information concerning a device you use to access, use, and/or interact with the Website, such as operating system type and/or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device, geo-location, unique device identifier and/or other device identifier, mobile phone carrier identification, and device software platform and firmware information.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregate</strong>: We may collect non-identifying and statistical information about the use of our Website, such as how many visitors visit a specific page, how long they stay on that page and which links, if any, they click on.&nbsp; This information represents a generic overview of our users, including their collective habits. Information collected in the aggregate is not associated with you as an individual. We may share user information in the aggregate with third parties.</li>
<li><strong>Other Tracking Technologies</strong>: We may supplement information you provide to us with information from other sources, such as information to validate and/or update your address and/or other demographic information. This information is used to maintain the accuracy of information on our Website and for internal analysis.&nbsp; We may also use clear gifs, pixel tags and web beacons, which are tiny graphic images placed on website pages and/or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions and are further used to track online movements of our users.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages.&nbsp; We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to your Personal Information.</li>
</ul>

<p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to other parties using the Website, or visit other websites linked through the Website, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them.

We encourage you to be sure the recipients are authenticated to your satisfaction before you send them any documents or sensitive information.</p>
