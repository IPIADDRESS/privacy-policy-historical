						<p>This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices in relation to information that we collect through the website operated by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Domain”), through the software applications made available by us for use on or through computers and mobile devices that link to this Privacy Policy (the “Apps”), through our social media pages and apps ( the “Social Media Pages”), and other services provided by us both online and offline; as well as through email messages that we send to you that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, including the Domain, the Apps and the Social Media Pages, the “<strong>Sites</strong>”). “<strong>You</strong>” or a “<strong>user</strong>” refers to any individual who visits or otherwise uses the Sites. By using the Sites, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that we receive from existing customers. Such information is governed by the terms of the applicable software license and services agreement, rather than this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>What Types of Information Does Panopto Collect?</strong></p>
<p><u>Personal Information</u>. “Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual, including: name, title, company name, job description, expertise, zip code/postal address, telephone number, or email address.</p>
<p><u>Other Information</u>. “Other Information” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual. This might include, for instance, browser and device information; App usage data; information collected through cookies, email tracking, pixel tags, and other technologies; and other information provided by you; or aggregated information. We use this information to facilitate our operation of the Sites and for other purposes described below.</p>
<p><u>IP Address</u>. Your “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you access the Sites, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that you visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. Panopto uses IP Addresses to calculate usage levels of the Sites, help diagnose problems with its servers, and administer the Sites.</p>
<p><strong>How Does Panopto Collect Information?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> We and our service providers may collect Personal Information in a variety of ways, including:</p>
<p><u>Through the Sites</u>: We may collect Personal Information through the Sites, e.g., when you request a free trial or demo, contact us, subscribe to our email newsletter, download content (e.g. white papers).</p>
<p><u>Offline</u>: We may collect Personal Information from you offline during phone calls with sales representatives, or when you contact customer service.</p>
<p><u>Information from Other Sources</u>: In order to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing, offers, and services to you, we may obtain information about you from other sources, such as public databases, marketing partners, social media platforms, as well as from other third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Other Information.</strong> We and our service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:</p>
<p><u>Through Your Browser or Device</u>: Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), operating system name and version, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the Sites (such as the Apps) you are using.</p>
<p><u>Through Your Use of the Apps</u>: When you download and use an App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.</p>
<p><u>Through Cookies and Other Similar Technologies</u>: Cookies and other similar technologies may be used to collect Other Information. Please review our Cookies Policy below for more information.</p>
<p><u>Through email</u>: Once you have opted in to receive email from us regarding the Apps, the Sites and related information, we and our service providers may collect open and click-through information each time you open or click on our email.</p>
<p><u>Through Web analytics services</u>: Panopto uses Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies to analyze how users use the Domain. The information generated about Domain usage is transmitted to Google in the U.S. This information is used to evaluate visitors’ use of the Domain, compile statistical reports on Domain activity, and provide other services related to the Site and Internet use. Google may also collect information about Domain visitors’ use of other websites. For more information about Google Analytics, or to opt out of Google Analytics, please go to: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a></p>
<p><u>By Aggregating Information</u>: Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Sites.</p>
<p><strong>Panopto Cookie Policy</strong></p>
<p>What are cookies?</p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the Sites. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.</p>
<p>The Sites use both 1st party cookies (which are set by the Site being visited) and 3rd party cookies (which are set by a server located outside the domain of the Sites).</p>
<p><u>Essential Cookies</u>. Essential cookies enable you to navigate our Sites and to use their services and features. Without these absolutely necessary cookies, the Sites will not perform as smoothly for you, and we may not be able to provide the Sites or certain services or features.</p>
<p><u>Analytics Cookies</u>. Analytics cookies collect information about your use of the Sites, and enable us to improve the way they work. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on the Sites, help us record any difficulties you have with the Sites, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Site, rather than the usage of a single person. We use the information to analyze the Sites traffic, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information.</p>
<p><u>Advertising Cookies</u>. Advertising cookies are set to display targeted promotions or advertisements based upon your interests on the Sites or to manage our advertising. These cookies collect information about your activities on this and other sites to provide you targeted advertising.</p>
<p><u>Visitor Cookies</u>. When you fill out a form on the Sites (including but not limited to the free trial form, contact us form, and white paper forms), a Visitor Cookie is set in order to remember your preferences such as form field values and visited web pages. We use Marketo, a third-party marketing automation tool, to set Visitor Cookies.</p>
<p><u>Opt In</u>. Depending on the country from which you visit our website, you may receive a message at the bottom of the page on your first visit notifying you of our use of cookies. By continuing to use our website without changing the cookie settings of your browser, you are opting in to our use of cookies.</p>
<p><strong>How Can I Manage Cookies?</strong></p>
<p>You may refuse or accept cookies from the Sites at any time by activating settings on your browser. Information about the procedure to follow in order to enable or disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider’s website via your help screen. You may wish to refer to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html</a> for information on commonly used browsers.

<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
<p>Panopto’s Site may contain links to other sites such as Panopto service products and sales affiliates. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites.</p>
<p><strong>How Does Panopto Secure Collected Personal Information?</strong></p>
<p>We maintain strict physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized or inappropriate access.

<p><strong>Sensitive Information</strong></p>
<p>We ask that you not send us or disclose any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background, or trade union membership) on or through the Sites or via other means.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Matters</strong></p>
<p>Panopto may preserve and has the right to disclose without your prior permission any information about you or your use of the Sites if Panopto has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) Protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Panopto or its affiliates, employees, other users of the Sites, or the public; (b) Enforce the terms and conditions that apply to use of this Site, or (c) Respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties.

<p><strong>Information Storage and Security</strong></p>
<p>Information collected through the Sites is processed and stored in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, by providing information to Panopto through the use of the Sites you are consenting to the transfer of the information to the United States for processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We have in place physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the Personal Information we collect, use, and maintain. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. We ask that you do your part by maintaining in strict confidence any computer passwords you use to access the Internet or the Sites.</p>
<p><strong>Information Related to Employment</strong></p>

<p><strong>Panopto, Inc. Not Interested in Minors</strong></p>

Panopto does not knowingly collect Personal Information from those under the age of 18. In an instance where such information was collected, it would be purely accidental and unintentional. Panopto encourages parents to discuss the Internet with their children and monitor Personal Information that a child may provide via the Internet.</p>

<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. When we do so, changes in our privacy policy will be effective immediately. If you are a regular visitor to the Sites, we recommend that you check this privacy policy on a regular basis.</p>
