		</header>
		
		<main>
			
			<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

			<p>We strongly believe you have the right to privacy when using our apps.</p>
			
			<p>Our privacy policy is simple: your data is none of our business.  To 
			the extent that our apps can provide their functionality without doing so, we 
			always prefer to avoid collecting any data from you.  In the cases where we do collect 
			data, we give you the ability to <a href="#opting-out">opt out</a> whenever possible.</p>
			
			<p>So, here's some detail about what our apps do, and why.</p>
			
			<h2 id="usage-analytics">Usage Analytics</h2>
			
			<p>Some of our apps may collect information about the way you use them by default. This
			data is always anonymized before it is sent to us, and cannot be used to personally
			identify you.  You can always <a href="#opting-out">opt out</a> of usage analytics if you wish.</p>
			
			<p>We look only for broad patterns in the aggregated usage data, such as whether 
			or not a particular feature is frequently used, or whether users in general 
			prefer one setting over another.  This helps us make informed decisions about 
			the future development of our apps.</p>
			
			<p>To be clear, we cannot track an individual user's behavior.  We also cannot receive information 
			from your device's displays, cameras, or microphones.</p>
			
			<h2 id="crash-logs">Crash Logs</h2>
			
			<p>If one of our apps crashes while you are using it, data about the crash will be 
			collected and sent to us to help identify the cause of the crash so that we can
			try to fix it in a future update.  These "crash logs" contain information 
			about the state of the app, operating system, and device at the time of the
			crash.  Nothing in the crash log can be used to personally identify you, and 
			crash logs do not contain any of your private data.</p>
			
			<h2 id="update-checking">Update Checking</h2>
			
			<p>By default, our Mac apps periodically check to see if a newer version of the app 
			is available, so that you can be given the choice to update if you wish.</p>
			
			<p>For apps acquired from the App Store or Mac App Store, update checking behavior
			is controlled by the operating system.</p>
			
			<p>For apps acquired via direct download from Panic's web site, an update check 
			request will be occasionally sent to a Panic-owned server.  This request
			contains the name and current version of the app you are using, and a small
			amount of metadata about your device (such as which operating system version
			it is running, and your preferred language) which may be necessary to guide 
			you to the correct update version.  You may turn off update checking from the 
			app's preferences window.</p>
			
			<p>Similarly, some of our apps also check with a Panic-owned server, on launch, to see if there is a news screen (we call it a "soapbox") to show you.
			We might use this news screen to, say, alert you to a major update. No private data is sent to perform this check.</p>
			
			<h2 id="email-list">Email List</h2>
						
			<p>In some of our apps, you will be given a one-time opportunity to sign up for
			our email newsletter the first time you open the app.  If you decline, no data
			will be sent.  If you accept, the email address you provide will be added to our email list.  </p>
			
			<p>Our email list is low volume (usually no more than a few messages a year), 
			and is generally limited to announcements of important new versions of our 
			apps, or significant new product releases.</p>
			
			<p>We do not sell or otherwise provide any of our email list to third-parties,
			with the exception of the company that provides the mailing list services.</p>
			
			<h2 id="activation">Activation</h2>
			
			<p>For apps acquired from the App Store or Mac App Store, no activation request
			is sent to Panic-owned servers.</p>
			
			<p>For apps acquired via direct download from Panic's web site, an activation 
			request is performed when you enter a serial number to unlock the app, and 
			may be repeated from time to time by already activated products.</p>
			
			<p>The activation request consists of a single message sent to a Panic-owned
			server, containing encrypted information about the serial number you entered
			into the app.  The server verifies whether the serial number is valid,
			and replies with a digitally signed confirmation if so.  Otherwise, an error 
			message is sent back for the app to display to you.</p>
			
			<h2 id="logging">Logging</h2>
			
			<p>When you interact with our servers using a web browser, or indirectly by
			network requests sent on your behalf by our apps, some metadata about the 
			request may be logged by us.  This metadata may include your IP address, the 
			name of the resource requested, and the name and version number of the 
			software making the request.</p>
			
			<p>We generally don't look at these logs unless a server appears to be being
			maliciously used or attacked in some way.  We may look at the information in 
			aggregate to see statistics such as how many times our apps have been 
			downloaded, or from what sources network traffic is arriving.</p>
			
			<h2 id="services-used">Services Used</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Collection and aggregation of usage analytics and crash logs is provided by 
				<a href="http://hockeyapp.net">Hockey</a>, <a href="http://crashlytics.com/">Crashlytics</a> and <a href="http://fabric.io">Fabric</a>.</li>
				
				<li>Update checking in direct download apps is provided by the <a href="https://sparkle-project.org">Sparkle</a> 
				framework.</li>
				
				<li>Email list services in direct download apps are provided by 
				<a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com">Campaign Monitor</a>.</li>
				
				<li>Web analytics services are provided by <a href="http://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="http://gosquared.com">GoSquared</a>.</li>
				
				<li>Activation services are developed internally by Panic.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2 id="data-not-collected">Data Not Collected</h2>
			
			<p>Panic apps <u>do not</u> send out <u>any</u> private information. This includes:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Your keyboard or screen input</li>
				<li>Network traffic</li>
				<li>Hostnames</li>
				<li>Usernames</li>
				<li>Passwords</li>
				<li>SSH / Encryption keys</li>
				<li>Contents of files you are working with</li>
				<li>Your IP address</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Apps like Transmit, whose core purpose is to send and receive your
			documents over a network, will, of course, send and receive your documents 
			as requested, but not to Panic or any other third party.  Documents in transit 
			will be encrypted only if you use a protocol which supports encryption, such as 
			SFTP, HTTPS, etc.  It is your responsibility to be aware of the security
			implications of the file transfer protocols you choose to use.</p>
			
			<h2 id="panic-sync">Panic Sync</h2>
			
			<p>Some of our apps provide an optional feature called <a href="/sync">Panic Sync</a>, which 
			replicates app configuration data across multiple devices you own.  If you 
			choose to use Panic Sync, we will collect and store the data necessary to 
			provide the syncing feature.  This data will be encrypted before transmission 
			and stored in a way that is unreadable, even by Panic employees.</p>
			
			<p>Refer to the <a href="https://panic.com/sync/">Panic Sync</a> page for specific details on its implementation.</p>
			
			<h2 id="opting-out">Opting Out</h2>
			
			<p>To see your options for opting out of data collection, refer to the <strong>Privacy</strong> 
			section in the app's <strong>Settings</strong> screen.</p>
			
			<h2 id="questions-and-feedback">Questions and Feedback</h2>
			
			<p>Please <a href="mailto:support@panic.com">contact us</a> if you have any questions about our data collection or 
			privacy policies.  We'll be more than happy to discuss them with you.</p>
