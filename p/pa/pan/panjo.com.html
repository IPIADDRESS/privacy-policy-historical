                <h3>Information Collected</h3>
                <p>In order to better provide you with content and access to products and services, we collect two types of information from you: personally identifiable information, including, but not limited to your name, address, and information submitted in creating your Account and Panjo Profile (together "Personally Identifiable Information") and non-personally identifiable information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide an enjoyable and customized experience while using our Website.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Personally Identifiable Information: We may use Personally Identifiable Information you provide in a limited number of ways. We may use your Personally Identifiable Information to (i) complete a transaction related to a Listing Item, (ii) provide you with information about us, (iii) enhance or update the Website; (iv) review your account to determine whether other Listing Items may be of interest to you; (v) conduct another transaction you request; (vi) compile demographic statistics about our users; (vii) make a record of your visit and log your IP address, the date and time of your visit to the Website, the Listing Items accessed, and the type of browser used; (viii) use in connection with business-related matters. We may also on occasion combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from other parties to enhance our ability to market to you Listing Items that may be of interest to you.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Demographic data also may be collected at our Website through the use of third-party tools. We may review the actions of the visitors of our Website on an aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences. We also may conduct research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and Listing Items viewed based on the information collected in connection with use of our Website. We may use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our Website, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze Website usage, to improve our product offerings, service offerings, and to customize the content, layout, and/or services provided on our Website. We may receive reports from third-party ad servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents that tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon or what content was served or viewed.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Referral: If you choose to introduce a friend to Panjo, or buy a Listing Item for a friend, we will ask you for your friend's name and/or email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email with the Listing Item you purchased for him or her or inviting him or her to visit the Website. Panjo stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, sending their Listing Item, and tracking the success of our referral program. A referred friend may contact us at support@panjo.com to request that we remove their information from our database.</p>

                        <p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific End User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are using and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described in Items 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy. This information may also be shared with our authorized third party service providers and advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.

                        <p>Though we will make every effort to preserve user privacy, pursuant to the terms of this Policy, we also may need to disclose Personally Identifiable Information when required by law or if we have a good-faith belief that the action is necessary to comply with a pending judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us or to protect our rights or the rights of others, to fight fraud, identity theft, to ensure the integrity and operation of our business and systems, or to protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, our employees, shareholders or others.</p>

A cookie is an industry-standard small file placed on your computer. Cookies allow us to "remember you" when you return to the Website to make your visits more relevant and to retrieve information from your prior visits. The cookie stores information about the searches that you have made and the items that you have viewed and allows us and other third-parties to replace non-relevant advertisements with ones that are more relevant to your presumed interests. You may delete cookies on your computer; however, if you enjoy the convenience of the Website remembering you, you are advised not to delete your cookies. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you.</p>

                                <p>We may use and allow others to use web beacons in the operation of our Website. A web beacon is an industry-standard, often transparent graphic image usually no larger than a 1x1 pixel that is placed on the Website. Web beacons allow us to track responses or actions by users who view certain advertisements and to count the number of times that users visit the pages of our Website and may be used by both us and third-parties for the purpose of providing personalized media, determining which advertisements are most effective on our Website, and for targeting future advertising campaigns. We may also include web beacons in email messages or promotional newsletters for detecting whether the messages have been opened or if you performed any actions after opening them.</p>

                        <p>We may run promotions for merchants where you may visit a third-party merchant website. In some of those promotions, a window or frame containing the merchant's website may appear. Any time you are in such a window, you should assume that your personal information is being collected, used and disclosed in accordance with that merchant's policies. This Policy does not apply to information that you supply to those merchants. Any information that you share with them will be used and disclosed in accordance with that merchant's privacy policy. However, once you click on a link to return to our Website, you can expect that further information that you disclose will be treated in accordance with this Policy.</p>

                        <p>In order to most efficiently serve you, the purchase of Listing Items utilizing credit card transactions may be handled by established third-party banking, processing agents and distribution institutions. They may receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order, if applicable.</p>
                        <p>We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your Personally Identifiable Information. The Website has industry-standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, and we make good faith efforts to store your Personally Identifiable Information in a secure operating environment. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. If we provide you with a user name and password to access portions of the Website, we disclaim any responsibility for a breach of privacy as a result of your willingly or inadvertently disclosing your user name and password to others.</p>

You may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information on your Panjo Account. We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on the Website.
