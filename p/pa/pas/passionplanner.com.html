-
1️⃣ Don’t worry about making money - focus on solving people’s problems YOU care about. I see money as life energy that you receive for serving the world. People will be willing to trade money when they see your product can make their life easier, more exciting or more enjoyable.
-
2️⃣ Simplify your message. If you can’t explain it to a 2nd grader, it’s too complicated.
-
3️⃣ Share your story. Your story is what gives your project a soul. Without a story you are simply a product that can be duplicated over and over.
-
4️⃣ Be a problem solver, not a problem dweller. When you take a risk, things are bound to go wrong. Quickly recognize the problem, come up with solutions, and act with decisiveness. Review results and repeat the process.
-
5️⃣ Hire your weaknesses and trust in their abilities. When I first started, it was just me in my parents garage doing everything from customer service, to product design and fulfillment. Now I have accountants, a full legal team, and an awesome team that I trust and empower to get the job done.
