<p>Pages on the webserver www.dfat.gov.au and its sub-domains conform to the following 
privacy guidelines:</p>

<p>We collect clickstream data in our HTTP logs. These logs are used
internally to better develop the site and allow us to report on site
activity. They are not used for any other purpose. When you visit
this web site, we make a record of your visit and log the following
information for statistical purposes:</p>

<blockquote>- the user's server address,
   
   <p>-the user's top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au,
   .uk etc),</p>
   
   <p>-the date and time of visit to the site,</p>
   
   <p>-the pages accessed and documents downloaded,</p>
   
   <p>-the type of browser used.</p></blockquote>

<p>No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing
activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a
law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the Internet
Service Provider's logs.</p>

<p>If you use forms on the site to purchase publications, the information you 
  provide is e-mailed to our publications section. It is not retained on the public 
  web server.</p>
<p>The passport renewal form (https://www.passports.gov.au/passport_renewal.html) 
  is secured using 40 or 128 bit certificates depending, on your browser.</p>

<p>We will only record your e-mail address if you send us a message. It will only 
  be used for the purpose for which it was provided and will not be added to a 
  mailing list unless that is the purpose of the message. We will not use your 
  e-mail address for any other purpose, and will not disclose it without your 
  consent. We do not redistribute any of this information outside of the Department.</p>
