    <td><font class="cl12Black">Microsoft<sup>®</sup> .NET Passport (".NET Passport") recognizes that your
	privacy and the protection of your personal information is important to you. This
	statement discloses how we protect your personal information while using
	the .NET Passport Web Site (www.passport.net), and while using the .NET Passport Service at
	participating Web sites. It does not apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites, products or services.</font><br><br>
      
      <font class="cl12Black">.NET Passport is a service that allows users to create a single sign-in name and password for use across 
      .NET Passport participating sites and services. In addition to .NET Passport sign-in, the .NET Passport Service also includes .NET 
      Passport wallet and .NET Passport express purchase. By using the .NET Passport Web Site and the .NET Passport Service, you 
      consent to the data practices described in this statement.</font><br><br>

      <font class="cl12Black">The <a href="/Consumer/KidsPrivacyPolicy.asp?lc=1033">.NET Passport Kids Privacy Statement</a> is a separate statement that describes the collection, use and 
      disclosure by .NET Passport of personal information from or about children and the Kids Passport service for obtaining parental 
      consent.</font><br><br>

      <a name="Collection"></a>
      <font class="cl14BoldBlack">.NET PASSPORT'S COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</font><br><br>
      <font class="cl12BoldBlack">What Information Is Collected by .NET Passport</font><br><br>

      <font class="cl12Black">When you register for a .NET Passport, you will be asked to provide certain personal information that will be 
      stored in the .NET Passport "profile." As described below, the amount of information requested will vary depending on the registering site, 
      but the .NET Passport profile contains, at most, the following information: (1) e-mail address, (2) first and last name, (3) country or region, 
      (4) state or territory, (5) ZIP code or postal code, (6) language, (7) time zone, (8) gender, (9) birth date, and (10) occupation. </font><br><br>

      <font class="cl12Black">.NET Passport will collect additional personal information if you choose certain optional features:</font><br><br>
	  <ul>
	     <li><font class="cl12Black">If you access the .NET Passport service via a mobile phone, your telephone number will be collected for use as a sign-in name.</font></li>
	     <li><font class="cl12Black">If you choose to create a .NET Passport wallet, .NET Passport collects additional personal information upon registration, including your name, telephone number, credit card information, and billing and shipping addresses. Your .NET Passport wallet information is stored separately from your .NET Passport profile.</font></li>
	  </ul>
	  
     <font class="cl12Black">When you register for your .NET Passport, you will be asked to create a password for your account. 
     If you are using .NET Passport from a mobile phone, you will be asked to create a PIN, which acts as your password. You may also be 
     requested to provide a secret question and secret answer. You use your secret question and answer to help verify your identity to .NET 
     Passport when there are account issues, such as needing to reset your password. Finally, some participating sites may require added 
     security. In these cases, you may be asked to create a NET Passport security key. None of this information is ever shared with any 
     participating site or service, or with any other third party. </font><br><br>

     <font class="cl12Black">.NET Passport associates a .NET Passport unique identifier with every .NET Passport account at registration. 
     The unique identifier is a unique 64-bit number that .NET Passport sends (encrypted) to each .NET Passport participating site when you 
     choose to sign in. This unique identifier makes it possible for the site to determine whether you are the same person from one sign-in 
     session to the next. </font><br><br>

     <font class="cl12Black">.NET Passport also temporarily logs individual sign-ins for the purpose of ensuring the efficiency and security 
     of the .NET Passport service. The information in these logs is identified only by the account's unique ID number, and it is never linked 
     with personal information unless a user calls the service to request assistance. </font><br><br>

     <font class="cl12BoldBlack">The Registering Site's Determination of What Information Is Collected</font><br><br>
     <font class="cl12Black">You can register for a .NET Passport at a .NET Passport participating site or service, or at the <a href="/Consumer/Default.asp?lc=1033">.NET Passport Web Site</a>. The amount of information collected by .NET Passport at registration time is determined by the registering site.</font><br><br>
     <font class="cl12Black">If you register for a .NET Passport at the .NET Passport Web Site, .NET Passport will collect an e-mail address and a password. This is all the information necessary to create a .NET Passport account.</font><br><br>
     <font class="cl12Black">If you register for a .NET Passport at a .NET Passport participating site or service, that site determines the personal information it wants you to provide. Please note that you will be opening two different accounts at the same time: one with the participating site or service and one with .NET Passport. <b>You should review the privacy statement for each .NET Passport participating site you register with to determine how each site or service will use the information it collects.</b></font><br><br>
     <font class="cl12Black">All of the information you provide during registration at a participating site may be stored by that site. However, the information described above is the most that .NET Passport stores.</font><br><br>
     <font class="cl12Black">Some information (for example, clothing sizes or music preferences) may be specific to and stored only by the participating site or service. If a .NET Passport participating site uses a single registration form to collect both .NET Passport information and site-specific information, the information stored by .NET Passport will be identified on the form by a .NET Passport icon next to each field. </font><br><br>
     <font class="cl12Black"><b>Note:</b> Some .NET Passport participating sites may require you to open an e-mail account that is automatically registered as a .NET Passport. For example, MSN Hotmail, MSN Explorer, MSN Internet access, and Charter Cable services all provide you with e-mail accounts that are also .NET Passports.</font><br><br>

    <font class="cl14BoldBlack">.NET PASSPORT'S USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</font><br><br>

    <font class="cl12BoldBlack">How .NET Passport Will Not Use Your Personal Information</font><br><br>

    <font class="cl12Black">.NET Passport <b>will not</b> sell or rent your personal information to third parties. </font><br><br>
    <font class="cl12Black">.NET Passport <b>will not</b> use or share your personal information in a manner that differs from what 
	  is described in this Privacy Statement without your prior consent.</font><br><br>


   <font class="cl12BoldBlack">How .NET Passport Uses Your Personal Information</font><br><br>

    <font class="cl12Black">.NET Passport uses your personal information for the operation and maintenance of your .NET Passport account and the .NET Passport Service. For example, .NET Passport uses your e-mail address to send you a welcome e-mail message when you first register informing you about the service, telling you how to manage your .NET Passport account. You must respond to this e-mail in order to validate that you are the owner of the e-mail address associated with the .NET Passport account. Failure to respond to the e-mail and verify the address within four days will cause the .NET Passport account to become inactive. This process is designed to prevent e-mail addresses from being used without permission in the creation of .NET Passport accounts.</font><br><br>
    <font class="cl12Black">.NET Passport may also send you e-mail about periodic service or recommended security updates or surveys related to the .NET Passport Service. These periodic e-mails are considered essential to the provision of the service you have requested. You cannot unsubscribe from these mailings. You may, however, choose not to participate in the surveys.</font><br><br>



     <a name="General"></a>
    <font class="cl14BoldBlack">.NET PASSPORT'S GENERAL DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</font><br><br>

    <font class="cl12Black">.NET Passport occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as answering customer support inquiries or performing statistical analyses of our services. .NET Passport will only provide these companies with those pieces of your personal information needed to deliver the services, and the companies and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any other purpose.</font><br><br>
    <font class="cl12Black">.NET Passport may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on Microsoft; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft, .NET Passport, or .NET Passport participating sites or services; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the .NET Passport Service, or the public.</font><br><br>

    

      <a name="SharingPersonal"></a>
    <font class="cl14BoldBlack">.NET PASSPORT'S DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TO PARTICIPATING SITES AND SERVICES</font><br><br>

    <font class="cl12Black">The information stored by .NET Passport is not shared with a .NET Passport participating site or service unless you explicitly choose to provide it by clicking the .NET Passport sign-in link or the .NET Passport express purchase button on that site. A list of <a href="/Directory/Default.asp?lc=1033">.NET Passport participating sites and services</a> is available.</font><br><br>
    <font class="cl12Black"><b>It is important for you to read the privacy statement for each .NET Passport participating site or service you visit before you sign in or make a .NET Passport express purchase, so that you understand how the site may use your .NET Passport information.</b></font><br><br>
    <font class="cl12Black">The specific details of what information is shared with a participating site or service when you choose to sign into that site or service are described below.</font><br><br>

     <font class="cl12BoldBlack">Your .NET Passport Profile Information</font><br><br>
         <font class="cl12Black">You can choose the type of information in your .NET Passport profile to share with the .NET Passport participating 
         sites that you sign in to. You can use the check boxes on the 'Edit Your .NET Passport Profile' page to choose 
         whether to share your e-mail address, your name, and/or the non-identifiable profile information, such as country.</font><br><br>

         <font class="cl12Black">There are three specific cases, however, in which a .NET Passport participating site will receive your profile information (except your password and secret question and secret answer) regardless of your check-box settings:</font><br><br>

	  <ul>
	     <li><font class="cl12Black">If you registered for a .NET Passport through a participating site or service, for example by filling out a combined 
	                                              registration form for both a .NET Passport and an account with the participating site or service, then that registering site 
	                                              or service will receive the profile information at the time of registration. </font></li>
	     <li><font class="cl12Black">When the registering site or service also provides you with an e-mail account as part of your .NET Passport account, 
	                                              then the company providing that e-mail service will receive your profile information on sign-in. For example, if the site 
	                                              at which you register for your .NET Passport account creates an @hotmail.com, @WebTV.net, or @msn.com e-mail account,
	                                              then MSN, the provider of those e-mail services, will receive updates to your profile information whenever you sign in to 
	                                              an MSN site or service. If those e-mail services are co-branded, both service providers may receive updates to your 
	                                              profile when you sign in to sites or services belonging to those providers. For example, @charter.com and 
	                                              @compaq.net e-mail accounts are MSN-provided e-mail services for whom Charter and Compaq, respectively, 
	                                              are co-branded providers and thus may also receive updates to your profile on an ongoing basis.
	     </font></li>
	     <li><font class="cl12Black">Currently, there are a few .NET Passport sites and services that require your e-mail address in order to provide 
	                                               you with their services. For example, .NET Messenger requires your email address to provide your requested 
	                                               messaging services. In those cases, .NET Passport will always provide your e-mail address when you sign in to 
	                                               that site or service.</font></li>
	  </ul>

          <font class="cl12BoldBlack">Your .NET Passport Wallet Information</font><br><br>
          <font class="cl12Black">You control which pieces of information in your .NET Passport wallet are shared with .NET Passport express purchase participating sites and services on a per-transaction basis. After clicking the .NET Passport express purchase button at a participating site, you will be able to choose which credit card and billing and shipping address information to send to the participating site for that purchase.</font><br><br>

          <font class="cl12BoldBlack">Operational Information</font><br><br>
          <font class="cl12Black">Some sites need additional .NET Passport information to operate your account properly and provide the services you have requested. This "operational" information does not include the personal information that you provide as part of your .NET Passport profile.</font><br><br>
          <font class="cl12Black">Operational information will be shared with sites regardless of whether you choose to share your profile information with the site when you sign in using your .NET Passport. The unique identifier described above is always shared with the .NET Passport participating site or service when you sign-in. Additional operational information shared at sign in may include:</font><br><br>

            <ul>
                    <li><font class="cl12Black">The version number .NET Passport assigns to your profile. (A new number is assigned each time you change your .NET Passport profile to tell participating sites that the information has been updated. Your personal .NET Passport profile information is not shared without your permission except as described in this Statement.)</font></li>
                    <li><font class="cl12Black">Whether your e-mail address has been verified. </font></li>
                    <li><font class="cl12Black">Whether your account has been deactivated. </font></li>
                    <li><font class="cl12Black">Whether your account is a Kids Passport account. </font></li>
                    <li><font class="cl12Black">Whether your account has an associated .NET Passport wallet. </font></li>
                    <li><font class="cl12Black">Whether you have consented to be listed in the Hotmail member directory or other public directories. </font></li>
            </ul>

            <font class="cl12BoldBlack">Use of Shared Information by .NET Passport Participating Sites and Services</font><br><br>
            <font class="cl12Black">.NET Passport participating sites and services with whom you choose to share the information can use it for a variety of purposes. These can include personalizing your experience at their sites and reducing registration time by using information in your .NET Passport account to pre-fill their registration forms. .NET Passport participating sites and services may share your personal information and/or unique identifier with third parties in order to fulfill a service or transaction you may have requested. 
                                              In addition, participating sites may share your personal information, but not your Unique ID, with third parties as permitted by their privacy policy.
            </font><br><br>
	     <font class="cl12Black">To become a .NET Passport participating site or service, the operator must contractually agree to have a posted privacy statement and to use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with industry-standard privacy guidelines and practices. All U.S.-based sites are also encouraged (but not required) to be registered with an independent, industry-recognized, privacy assurance organization such as 
	                                     <a href="http://www.truste.org">TRUSTe</a> or <a href="http://www.bbbonline.org">BBBOnLine</a>.</font><br><br>
	     <font class="cl12Black">Nevertheless, the privacy practices of .NET Passport participating sites will vary. <b>You should carefully review the privacy statement for each .NET Passport participating site 
	                                       you sign in to in order to determine how each site or service will use the information it collects. </b></font><br><br>
            <font class="cl12Black">If .NET Passport becomes aware of ongoing, site-specific privacy issues with a .NET Passport participating site or service, we will work to address those issues with the site or service. If at any time you believe that a .NET Passport participating site has not adhered to these 
                                             principles, please notify <a href="mailto:passpriv@microsoft.com">.NET Passport by e-mail</a>.</font><br><br>

            <font class="cl12BoldBlack">Access to Your Personal Information</font><br><br>
            <font class="cl12Black">You can always add, update, or make other changes to the information in your <a href="http://memberservices.passport.net/memberservice.srf?lc=1033&amp;cbid=486">.NET Passport profile</a> or your <a href="https://wallet.passport.com/ppsecure/default.asp?lc=1033">.NET Passport wallet</a>.</font><br><br>
            <font class="cl12BoldBlack">Closing Your .NET Passport Account</font><br><br>
            <font class="cl12Black">The process for closing your .NET Passport account is determined by the issuer of that .NET Passport, as described in 
                                              <a href="ClosingPassport.asp?lc=1033">Closing Your .NET Passport</a>.</font><br><br>
            <font class="cl12Black">If you attempt to register for a .NET Passport and find that someone else has already created a .NET Passport account with your e-mail address, you have the option of contacting .NET Passport customer service and requesting that the .NET Passport account using your e-mail address be forced to change so that you may use your e-mail address as your .NET Passport.</font><br><br>
            


            <a name="Security"></a>
            <font class="cl14BoldBlack">SECURITY AND STORAGE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</font><br><br>
           <font class="cl12Black">Your .NET Passport information is stored on secured .NET Passport servers located in controlled facilities. 
                                             You must type the correct password to access your .NET Passport information, and your password is never shared with .NET Passport participating sites or services. It is your responsibility to ensure the security of your .NET Passport account password and not to share this information during chats, in postings in newsgroups, or in other public forums. If you choose to reveal or share your password and .NET Passport account name, .NET Passport is unable to guarantee the security of your .NET Passport account.
           </font><br><br>
           <font class="cl12Black">When you request to have your .NET Passport information sent to a .NET Passport participating site, .NET Passport uses industry-standard security technologies to encrypt it for secure transmission over the Internet.</font><br><br>
           <font class="cl12Black">Personal information collected by .NET Passport may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or agents maintain facilities. By using the .NET Passport Service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Microsoft abides by the Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.

            <font class="cl14BoldBlack">.NET PASSPORTS CREATED BY SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS</font><br><br>
            <font class="cl12Black">If you received your .NET Passport from someone else, without registering for it yourself, your .NET Passport may belong to a "managed domain." In a managed domain, the administrator of a company with whom you have a business relationship (for example, your ISP) can create your .NET Passport for you, including your .NET Passport e-mail address and password. You can then use the .NET Passport like any other .NET Passport. The administrator, however, has access to the .NET Passport and can edit your .NET Passport profile, reset your password, and manage the .NET Passport account without your additional consent. The administrator does not have access to any information you may have saved in a .NET Passport wallet.

            <font class="cl14BoldBlack">USE OF COOKIES</font><br><br>
           <font class="cl12Black">A cookie is a very small text file that a Web site saves to your computer's hard disk to store information that you provide about yourself or to store your preferences. .NET Passport uses cookies whenever you sign in to a .NET Passport participating site. .NET Passport stores your unique identifier, the time you signed in, and whatever .NET Passport profile information you have chosen to share with participating sites, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. The cookie allows you to move from page to page at the participating site without having to sign in again on each page.
           </font><br><br>
           <font class="cl12Black">You have the ability to accept or decline cookies using the settings on your browser. If you choose to decline cookies, you will not be able to sign in using your .NET Passport.</font><br><br>
           <font class="cl12Black">When you sign out of .NET Passport, all .NET Passport-related cookies from participating sites are deleted from your computer. The sites or services you visited, however, may store their own cookies on your computer, and these may remain on your computer after you sign out of .NET Passport. .NET Passport recommends that you read each participating site's privacy statement to understand their policies and practices regarding the use of cookies.
