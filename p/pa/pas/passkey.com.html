<h2 class="p4">Lanyon Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong><em>Effective date: 10 October 2014</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The mission of Lanyon Solutions, Inc. (“Lanyon”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is to connect Buyers and Suppliers together in an on-line marketplace to facilitate the communication of content and the contracting of rates. This privacy policy covers information collected through our Web sites www.lanyon.com, www.passkey.com, www.regonline.com (Our “Sites”), Our Passkey GroupMAX Platform, our Lanyon Travel Supply and Demand Service Platforms and the Starcite Suite of Services (Our “Service Platforms”) (collectively the “Services”). The use of information collected through our services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged Lanyon.</p>
<p>Being part of Lanyon means, in some cases, sharing information about yourself with other professionals, and communicating with them during the contracting processes.</p>
<p>By default, individual hotels, hotel chains and corporate customers, are set up in the Lanyon database with contact information so that only correct and authorized information gets shared in the marketplace. This contact information is work-related and only contains personal information necessary to identify the contact and their role in the organization.</p>
<p>Lanyon has received TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal. The TRUSTe certification only covers information collected on www.regonline.com, www.lanyon.com, www.passkey.com and our Service Platforms. If you have questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at corporatesupport@lanyon.com. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.</p>
<p>Here are the three main types of information on Lanyon:</p>
<p><em>Information about yourself that you share. </em>This is the information that Lanyon customers see about you. This includes your name and contact details, including the hotel, corporation or other business entity you are associated to in the marketplace. <strong>You have control over this content, and you can update information at any time.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>Communication. </em>We help you communicate with other Lanyon marketplace users using built-in email mechanisms. This email communication is one-to-one and is based on standard notifications which are generated from the Lanyon systems. They do not require you to respond to these emails and share any additional information, and are primarily emails notifying you to log in to Lanyon to perform some action(s). <strong>You decide upon the action you wish to take upon receiving these notifications.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Newsletters. If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions located at the bottom of each communication.</p>
<p>Service-related announcements. We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions, when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.</p>
<p>Customer Service. Based upon the personal information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.</p>
<p><em>Private activity. </em>We also provide tools that you use during the course of solicitation, negotiation, and content distribution. We encourage you to only use the built-in notifications for any communication in the marketplace and to not use the contact information for any private means.</p>
<p><strong>Please read this policy </strong>and send us questions, concerns and suggestions to privacy@lanyon.com</p>

<p><strong>1. Information Collected&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The mission of Lanyon is to connect Buyers and Suppliers together in an on-line marketplace to facilitate the communication of content and the contracting of rates. To achieve this mission, Lanyon makes features and functionality available through our websites, including our mobile and other applications, developer platform, and other information provided as part of the Lanyon services (“Services”) to enable hotels, hotel chains, airlines, car rental companies and other hospitality industry suppliers to interact with hospitality buyers such as corporations, travel management companies, agencies, and consortia. By joining Lanyon, you voluntarily and willingly provide Lanyon Corporation, a company headquartered in Irving, Texas, USA, certain information, including some limited personally identifiable information, which we collect in order to provide the Services. If you have any hesitation about providing information to us and/or having your information displayed on the Lanyon website or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, you should contact us immediately at privacy@lanyon.com.</p>
<p>We collect your personal information in the following ways:</p>
<p><em>A. Creating a User ID and Login&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>In order to become a User, a User ID and password are created for you. A minimum set of information is required to create a User Login: name, email address, and password. Without this minimal amount of information, you cannot create a Lanyon User ID. In some cases a User ID and Password are created on your behalf, such as when a hotel is built in the system. In these instances it is often a colleague in your organization who has made the request or created a User ID on your behalf. This information is collected online for some of our Services and offline for others.</p>
<p>Your password can be changed and updated at any time by you. We encourage you to ensure your password is known only by you. In the event your User ID and password is created for you, we encourage you to change the password when you log in for the first time, so that your password is known only to you.</p>
<p>Lanyon enables other information to be collected from you during the User ID creation process, (e.g., gender, location (such as mailing address), etc.) that Lanyon can then use to provide better, more customized services. If you feel uncomfortable about providing this additional information then do not, as you are not required to do so in order to use Lanyon’s core services. You acknowledge that this information is personal to you, and by creating an User ID on Lanyon, you allow others, including Lanyon, to identify you and to allow Lanyon to use your information to display and send notifications to you.</p>
<p>We will collect contact information about other people when you create an email invitation, add a new user, or add a sub-account.&nbsp;&nbsp; We use this information to create invitations on your behalf and allow you to add users to sub-accounts to your current account. We do not use this information for any other reason. If these users wish to request removal of their information, they may do so by contacting us at privacy@lanyon.com.</p>
<p><em>B. Profile Information/Social Media Features&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Once you become a User, you may provide additional information to your Lanyon contact information such as gender and location. Providing additional information about yourself beyond what is minimally required at registration is entirely up to you. Any information you provide at registration or in the contacts section may be used by Lanyon as described in this Privacy Policy, including for the purpose of allowing Lanyon marketplace users to find you on Lanyon, and send you notifications such as the solicitation, or response to, a contracted rate or piece of hotel related data.</p>
<p>Your contact information will be displayed to authorized and legitimate Lanyon users in order for them to select you as a recipient of a notification. This notification will then be sent through the Lanyon system to your email address. You may also choose to manually enter or upload data about your contacts to the “Contacts” section of your profile on Lanyon.</p>
<p>Our sites offer publicly accessible community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.</p>
<p>Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosed by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
<p><em>C. Customer Service&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>We collect information when you interact with Lanyon’s customer support or account management teams in order to accurately recognize you and respond to customer inquiries . In some cases this includes requesting your User ID, your name, and your email address, or other related information. If you do not wish to give this information for identification purposes, you may elect to send an email to our support teams to assist.</p>
<p><em>D. Using the Lanyon Site and Applications&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>We receive information when you interact with and use the Lanyon websites and Lanyon Applications (e.g. Lanyon Content Control Center “3C”), Lanyon corporate transient sourcing tool, etc. This information is for the purpose of identifying you and ensuring the correct services are provided to you when you login. If you have any concerns with this you may contact us at privacy@lanyon.com.</p>
<p><em>E. Using Third Party Services and Visiting Third Party Sites&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>In some cases we receive information when you login to a web site or application provided by your company. In those instances where you login to a company web site or application, if your company has elected to set up an automatic sign-in to Lanyon, your User ID and password may be automatically sent to Lanyon to login simultaneously to a Lanyon web site or application. If you are unsure when this occurs or if you have any concerns on this process please contact your company administrator or the Lanyon support or account management teams. Lanyon will only use “login” information to give access to an authorized Lanyon web site / application and in some cases to personalize the Lanyon-provided functionality.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>F. Advertising and Web Beacons&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (link to TRUSTe opt-out: http://preferences.truste.com/ ). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
<p><em>G. </em>Information We Collect Automatically. As true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do not link this automatically collected data with other information we collect about you.</p>
<p><em>H. Data Retention&nbsp;</em></p>

Additional information such as browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data may also be collected.
