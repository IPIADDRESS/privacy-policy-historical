<p><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Similar Technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Our Site uses “cookie,” “web beacon,” and “tag” technology. We use
cookies, web beacons and tags to identify your device, provide website
user authentication, conduct fraud prevention and management services,
distinguish you from other visitors, record your IP address and
understand your use of our site, and identify the name of the Web site
from which you linked to the Company. This information is used for
fulfilling contracts with our business partners, and to help us serve
you better by improving our website design, as well as our products,
services, and promotions. We do not otherwise track any information
about your use of other websites. Information obtained through cookies,
web beacons and tags may be shared with or obtained by service providers
on our behalf. A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard
drive of your computer when you visit a website. A “session cookie”
expires immediately when you end your session (i.e., close your
browser). A “persistent cookie” stores information on the hard drive so
when you end your session and return to the same website at a later
date, the cookie information is still available. Web beacons and tags
are small strings of code that are used in conjunction with a cookie and
that allow us to record activity on the Site.</p>
<p>When you visit the Site, we may use both a session and a persistent
cookie. This Company-placed cookie may contain information (such as a
unique user ID) that is used to track your usage of our Site and in some
cases, your email address. Your email address is only saved in this
Company-placed cookie if you register with us. A web beacon allows us to
capture certain additional types of information about a visitor’s
actions on a web site, such as a visitor’s cookie number, the time,
date, duration and number of page views, a description of the page where
the web beacon is placed, and details about any items that were
purchased. If you register with us, this Company-placed cookie allows us
to recognize you when you return to our website and provides you with
access to your account information. If you save your information with or
order from us, we may also use cookies to monitor and maintain
information about your use of our Site. If you have not saved your
information with or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain
information about your use of our Site in a manner that does not
identify you. You can disable cookies at any time by using your browser
options; however, if you turn off cookies, we will not be able to track
your order or enable you to make a purchase from our Site. In addition,
we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you
access to your account information. We may use flash cookies (also known
as local stored objects) or other similar technologies. A flash cookie
is a small data file placed on a computer using Adobe Flash technology
that may be built into your computer or downloaded by you to your
computer. We use these technologies to personalize and enhance your
online experience, facilitate processes, personalize and store your
settings. Flash cookies may help our Site visitors to, for example, set
volume preference associated with a video experience, play games and
perform surveys. They help us improve our sites by measuring which areas
are of greatest interest to customers. We do not use flash cookies for
marketing or behavioral targeting purposes. Flash cookies are different
from browser cookies and the cookie management tools provided by your
browser will not remove flash cookies. If you disable flash cookies or
other similar technologies, please be aware that you may not have access
to certain features and services that make your online experience more
efficient and enjoyable.</p>
<p><strong>3. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Media Plug-Ins and Sharing with Other Sites You May
Authorize.</strong>
Social media plug-ins of social networks, which may
include, but are not limited to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and
Pinterest, may be integrated into our Site and other Services. Where
our Site or other Service contains a plug-in to a social networking
site, these are clearly marked (i.e. with a button). If you choose
to click on one of these buttons or links, you browser will connect
directly to the servers of the relevant social networking site. The
social media network directly transmits the content of the plug-in
to your browser. The Company assumes no responsibility or liability
for the actions of such third parties with respect to their use of
your information or otherwise. Accordingly, make sure you are aware
of and comfortable with the privacy policies of any third parties
that you authorize to gather information from the Company.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING AND LINKS TO OTHER SITES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internet Advertising Programs.</strong></li>
<li><p>We use third-party service
providers to serve advertisements (banners or links) on our behalf
across the Internet. These advertising service providers may collect
non-identifiable information about your visits to our website, and
your interactions with our products and services. Such
non-identifiable information does not include your name, address,
email address or other personal information. The information is
collected through the use of cookies and pixel tags (also known as
action tags), which is industry-standard technology used by most
major websites.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In addition to the information about your visits to our Site, our
service providers may also use the information about your visits to
other websites to target advertisements for products and services
available from Paint Nite. Currently, we use third party-placed
tracking pixels and cookies. In the future we may partner with
companies to provide interest-based advertising, both on and off
paintnite.com. If you would like more information about this
practice and to know your choices for not having this information
used by third-party service providers, please contact the Company at
the address listed below.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Third-Party Platform Advertising.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>We may also use platforms
provided by companies such as Facebook and Google to offer you
interest-based ads. These platforms allow us to personalize the ads
that we display to you. We do not share any of your personal
information, including your shopping history, with these platform
vendors. The Company may convert your email address into a unique
value which can be matched by our partner company with a user on
their platform to allow the Company to serve you interest-based
advertising. Although we do not provide any personal information to
these platform vendors, they may gain insights about individuals who
respond to the ads we serve.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company does not control the privacy policies of third parties that
have Web sites linked to the Site. If you click on an advertisement or
link, the privacy policies of the Web site that you link to will govern
the use of your information by that Web site's operator. The Company
assumes no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third
parties with respect to their use of your information or otherwise.
Accordingly, make sure you are aware of and comfortable with the privacy
policies of any third-party Web sites you link to.</p>
<p><strong>5. GUIDELINES REGARDING CHILDREN (COPPA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Company is not designed or intended for use by persons under 21.
At various places on the Site or other Service, we may ask users for
their age. Persons under 21 are expressly prohibited from submitting
any Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) to us,
and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such
information from a person under 21, we will take appropriate steps
to delete it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. HOW WE PROTECT AND SECURE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We maintain security measures in place in order to attempt to
protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the Personally
Identifiable Information under our control. Please be advised,
however, that the Internet and other various networking
communication media are not entirely secure, and your information
may therefore be subject to interception or loss, which is beyond
our control. While we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable
Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
Personally Identifiable Information you transmit to us. Any
transmission is done at your own risk. Accordingly, the Company
assumes no responsibility or liability for disclosure of your
information (Personally Identifiable Information or otherwise) due
to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access or other
causes beyond the Company's reasonable control.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. APPLICABLE LAW</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We control and operate the Site and any other Service from the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States. The
interpretation and application of this Privacy Policy shall be
governed by the laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts without regard to its conflict of law provisions. This
Site or other Service is not intended to subject us to the laws or
jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of
the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Please note
that we do not represent or warrant that the Site or other Service
is appropriate for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who
choose to access the Site or other Service do so at their own
initiative and are responsible for complying with all local laws,
rules and regulations. If you are located in a country outside the
United States and submit personal information to us, you are
consenting to the transfer, processing, storage and use of that
information in the United States as provided in this Policy. Any
disputes regarding the interpretation of this Privacy Policy or any
claims related to this Privacy Policy may only be brought in (i) any
Federal Court in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or (ii) any State
Court in Middlesex County Massachusetts. You agree that venue for
any such dispute shall be exclusively in Massachusetts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS (California residents)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our visitors who are
California residents to request certain information regarding our
disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct
marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us at
info@paintnite.com.</li>

and conditions of this Policy, and the Company will have the right

</ul>
<p><strong>10. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<ul>

initiatives, changes in the law or technology, or changes in our
practices regarding information collection and use. You can
determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the
‘Last Updated’ legend at the top of this page. Any changes to this
Policy will become effective upon posting of the revised Policy on

have agreed to such changes. If you do not agree with the terms of
this Policy, as it may be amended from time to time, please do not
continue using the Site or other Service. To the extent that an
arbitrator or court of applicable jurisdiction determines that
applying any changes to this Policy would render this an illusory or
unenforceable contract, such changes shall be applicable on a
prospective basis only, with respect to events or circumstances
occurring after the date of such changes, to the extent necessary to
avoid this Policy being deemed illusory or unenforceable.</li>
</ul>
