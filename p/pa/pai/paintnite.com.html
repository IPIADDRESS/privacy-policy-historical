<p><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Similar Technologies.</strong></p>
<p>Our Site uses "cookie," "web beacon," and "tag" technology.  We use cookies, web beacons and tags to identify your device, provide website user authentication, conduct fraud prevention and management services, distinguish you from other visitors, record your IP address and understand your use of our site, and identify the name of the Web site from which you linked to the Company.  This information is used for fulfilling contracts with our business partners, and to help us serve you better by improving our website design, as well as our products, services, and promotions.  We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites.  Information obtained through cookies, web beacons and tags may be shared with or obtained by service providers on our behalf.  A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website.  A "session cookie" expires immediately when you end your session (i.e., close your browser).  A "persistent cookie" stores information on the hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie information is still available.  Web beacons and tags are small strings of code that are used in conjunction with a cookie and that allow us to record activity on the Site.</p>
<p>When you visit the Site, we may use both a session and a persistent cookie. This Company-placed cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID) that is used to track your usage of our Site and in some cases, your email address.  Your email address is only saved in this Company-placed cookie if you register with us.  A web beacon allows us to capture certain additional types of information about a visitor's actions on a web site, such as a visitor's cookie number, the time, date, duration and number of page views, a description of the page where the web beacon is placed, and details about any items that were purchased.  If you register with us, this Company-placed cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our website and provides you with access to your account information. If you save your information with or order from us, we may also use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our Site.  If you have not saved your information with or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our Site in a manner that does not identify you.  You can disable cookies at any time by using your browser options; however, if you turn off cookies, we will not be able to track your order or enable you to make a purchase from our Site.  In addition, we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information. We may use flash cookies (also known as local stored objects) or other similar technologies.  A flash cookie is a small data file placed on a computer using Adobe Flash technology that may be built into your computer or downloaded by you to your computer. We use these technologies to personalize and enhance your online experience, facilitate processes, personalize and store your settings.  Flash cookies may help our Site visitors to, for example, set volume preference associated with a video experience, play games and perform surveys.  They help us improve our sites by measuring which areas are of greatest interest to customers.  We do not use flash cookies for marketing or behavioral targeting purposes.  Flash cookies are different from browser cookies and the cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove flash cookies.  If you disable flash cookies or other similar technologies, please be aware that you may not have access to certain features and services that make your online experience more efficient and enjoyable.</p>
<p><strong>3. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Media Plug-Ins and Sharing with Other Sites You May Authorize.</strong>   Social media plug-ins of social networks, which may include, but are not limited to Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest, may be integrated into our Site and other Services. Where our Site or other Service contains a plug-in to a social networking site, these are clearly marked (i.e. with a button). If you choose to click on one of these buttons or links, you browser will connect directly to the servers of the relevant social networking site. The social media network directly transmits the content of the plug-in to your browser. The Company assumes no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third parties with respect to their use of your information or otherwise. Accordingly, make sure you are aware of and comfortable with the privacy policies of any third parties that you authorize to gather information from the Company.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING AND LINKS TO OTHER SITES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internet Advertising Programs.</strong>   We use third-party service providers to serve advertisements (banners or links) on our behalf across the Internet.  These advertising service providers may collect non-identifiable information about your visits to our website, and your interactions with our products and services. Such non-identifiable information does not include your name or address. The information is collected through the use of cookies and pixel tags (also known as action tags), which is industry-standard technology used by most major websites.</li>
<li>In addition to the information about your visits to our Site, our service providers may also use the information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for products and services available from Yaymaker.  Currently, we use third party-placed tracking pixels and cookies. In the future we may partner with companies to provide interest-based advertising, both on and off yaymaker.com. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices for not having this information used by third-party service providers, please contact the Company at the address listed below.</li>
<li><strong>Third-Party Platform Advertising.</strong>  We may also use platforms provided by companies such as Facebook and Google to offer you interest-based ads.  These platforms allow us to personalize the ads that we display to you. The Company may convert your email address into a unique value which can be matched by our partner company with a user on their platform to allow the Company to serve you interest-based advertising. Although we do not provide any personal information to these platform vendors, they may gain insights about individuals who respond to the ads we serve.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company does not control the privacy policies of third parties that have Web sites linked to the Site. If you click on an advertisement or link, the privacy policies of the Web site that you link to will govern the use of your information by that Web site's operator. The Company assumes no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third parties with respect to their use of your information or otherwise. Accordingly, make sure you are aware of and comfortable with the privacy policies of any third-party Web sites you link to.</p>
<p><strong>5. GUIDELINES REGARDING CHILDREN (COPPA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At various places on the Site or other Service, we may ask users for their age.  Persons under 13 are expressly prohibited from submitting any Personally Identifiable Information (as defined herein) to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such information from a person under 13, we will take appropriate steps to delete it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. HOW WE PROTECT AND SECURE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We maintain security measures in place in order to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the Personally Identifiable Information under our control.  Please be advised, however, that the Internet and other various networking communication media are not entirely secure, and your information may therefore be subject to interception or loss, which is beyond our control. While we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personally Identifiable Information you transmit to us. Any transmission is done at your own risk.  Accordingly, the Company assumes no responsibility or liability for disclosure of your information (Personally Identifiable Information or otherwise) due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access or other causes beyond the Company's reasonable control.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. APPLICABLE LAW</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We control and operate the Site and any other Service from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States. The interpretation and application of this Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to its conflict of law provisions. This Site or other Service is not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Please note that we do not represent or warrant that the Site or other Service is appropriate for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Site or other Service do so at their own initiative and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations.
