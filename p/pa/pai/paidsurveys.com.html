        Privacy Policy</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
        <br>
        PaidSurveys takes your privacy seriously, and has created this Privacy
        Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to online privacy.
        Keep reading to learn more about our information gathering and
        dissemination practices, and our use of personally identifiable
        information.<br>
        <br>
        PERSONAL INFORMATION -&nbsp; When you register to use our services, we
        collect a variety of information about you.<span>&nbsp; </span>Generally,
        we use your information to send you the surveys most relevant to you.<span>
        </span>While visiting our site, we may provide you with advertisements,
        promotions, sweepstakes, and offers from third party providers. If you
        choose to accept any such offers, you may directly provide your
        information in connection with the offer to such third-party provider. <span>&nbsp;</span>Please
        refer to the third party provider’s own privacy policy if you have any
        questions regarding how your information will be used by such providers.
        <span>&nbsp;</span>Please be aware that these offers may be presented on
        pages framed by a Company website. <span>&nbsp;</span>Although these
        offer pages have the look and feel of our website, you will be
        submitting your information directly to the third-party advertiser. <span>&nbsp;</span>You
        agree that we will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage
        of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result
        of the presence of such providers on a Company site.<br>
        <br>
        COOKIES -&nbsp; We use “cookies” to keep track of some types of
        information while you are visiting our website or using our services.
        Cookies are very small files placed on your computer, and they allow us
        to count the number of visitors to our website and distinguish repeat
        visitors from new visitors. We rely on cookies for the proper operation
        of our website.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, if your browser is set to
        reject all cookies, the website may not function properly. Users who
        refuse cookies assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of
        functionality. We do not link the cookies to any of your personal
        information.<br>
        <br>
        EMAIL MESSAGES - We require an e-mail address from you when you register
        for our services. We use your e-mail to contact you about new survey
        opportunities. <span>&nbsp;</span>We reserve the right to send you
        certain communications relating to the Company services, such as service
        announcements and administrative messages. <span>&nbsp;</span>By signing
        up for our services, you agree to receive our newsletter and offers to
        take surveys and other money making opportunities. If you do not wish to
        receive these e-mails, you may opt-out at any time, by clicking on the
        opt-out link in the e-mail messages you receive.<span>&nbsp;</span><br>
        <br>
        LINKS TO OTHER SITES - PaidSurveys expects its partners, advertisers and
        affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that
        third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other
        content providers accessible through our site, may have their own
        privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during
        your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame of
        content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, via
        our site you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information,
        Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties.
        PaidSurveys is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third
        parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third
        parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a
        third party.<br>
        <br>
        CHILDREN UNDER 13 - PaidSurveys does not knowingly collect or solicit
        Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13
        except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any
        information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will
        delete that information immediately. If you believe PaidSurveys has any
        information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us.<br>
