<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<span class="revised">Revised January, 2013</span>

<p>
	PaidSurveys.com takes your privacy seriously, and has created this Privacy
	Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to online privacy. Keep
	reading to learn more about our information gathering and dissemination
	practices, and our use of personally identifiable information.
	PaidSurveys.com has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our
	commitment to the privacy of users like you because your privacy is of
	utmost importance to us.
</p>

<h4 class="blue">IP Addresses</h4>
<p>
	We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our site or web
	server, and for the general administration of our website. Your IP address,
	should you decide to register and/or create a PaidSurveys account, is also
	used to help prevent you from creating duplicate accounts.
</p>

<h4 class="blue">Cookies</h4>
<p>
	Upon your first visit to this web site, a "cookie" is sent to your computer.
	A cookie is a tiny file that identifies you as a unique user. It stores
	personal preferences and user data, however, in no way does this tell us who
	you are. PaidSurveys.com has two primary uses for its cookies.
</p>
<p>
	First, we use cookies to track special offers and promotions that may be
	presented to you as you navigate our website. This is done so that you are
	not presented with the same special offers and/or promotions over and over,
	or after you have indicated you are not interested.
</p>
<p>
	Secondly, we use cookies as part of our authenticaton system when you login
	to your account. If you select the "remember me" option when logging in, our
	site will set a cookie so that you do not have to login again the next time
	you visit PaidSurveys.com. While both of these activities depend on the use
	of a "cookie," visitors to this site always have the option of disabling
	cookies in their web browser. Most browsers are initially set to accept
	cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when
	a cookie is being sent.
