  <h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">Our Privacy Pledge:</h2>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">When you participate at PV as a member, your privacy is assured.</h3>

  <p>
    You will notice when you register at PV that we do not ask for your full name. We ask for a user name for the purpose of
    addressing you in emails and displaying your wins to our community on our home page and past winners pages.
    You are free to supply a pseudonym on PV. We are not interested in your real name. We also do not ask for your precise address.
    Depending on your country of residence, you may need to supply your phone number in order to validate your account.
    In the US, we ask for your state, county and zip code. In other countries we may as for similar geographic and postal information,
    but not your precise address. We ask for your email address at registration. We will not rent, sell or share your email address with
    anyone without your expressed permission, except in the rare instances required by law.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    You are able, at your option, to upload an avatar into your account. This is entirely voluntary.
    The avatar may be your true likeness or photo at your sole discretion. If you choose to upload an avatar,
    PV may from time to time display your avatar on publicly viewable portions of the website and label the avatar with your first name,
    first initial of last name supplied at registration and account winnings or cash out. Your avatar may be overlaid on a map and
    show your approximate registered location. Umongous will not share your avatar with Umongous Clients or associate it with any survey answers.
    Should you decline to upload an avatar, PV may on occasion display a stock avatar image along with your first name, first
    initial of last name and account winnings or cash out.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    If you use a social media login, such as Facebook, your social media profile photo and name will be shared with us through the relevant API.
    In those cases, PV will display your social media profile photo as your avatar on PV.  Your true name, obtained from the API will
    also be displayed on your profile page within PV.  Your registration demographics, such as your relationship status, household income,
    employment status, etc., will not be displayed on your PV profile page for others to see nor shared in a personally identifiable fashion with
    any third party at any time, with the exception of PV employees who may be required to service your account.
    Your precise answers to survey questions and traits questions will not be displayed on your PV profile page nor shared in a personally identifiable fashion,
    with any third party at any time with the exception of PV employees who may be required to service your account.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    We do share your anonymous demographics, which you supply during registration or periodically update, with our Clients, along with your survey answers.
    Although our Clients are not interested in your personal identity, theoretically (in unusual circumstances), there could be cases where our Clients
    might be able to determine your personal identity. An example would be if you live in a zip code with a very small population and your
    demographics are unique for that zip code. In practice, we are unaware of any of our Clients making this effort. Such an effort by Umongous
    Clients is against our policy and MR-TOS. Because our Umongous survey system is self-service, it is possible that one of our Clients could potentially
    violate our policies and MR-TOS and deploy a survey into PV that requests personally identifiable information (PIA). We urge you not to answer
    any question in a market research survey that requests PIA such as your real name, address, phone number, social security number or email address.
    If you see such a violation on PV, please report this violation to notification [at] paidviewpoint [dot] com.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Umongous will never try to sell you anything. We will never share, rent, sell or provide your email address to anyone else who might
    want to sell you anything. We are not in the lead generation business and it is against our MR-TOS for Umongous Clients to use our
    system and attempt to access you through PV for that purpose.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Your individual responses to surveys will also be kept confidential and will never be linked to your personal identifying information
    WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT Umongous does supply the demographics provided by you at registration and kept updated by you
    in your profile including state, county, zip code and inferred city or town. This information is supplied to Umongous Clients along with
    your survey answers so that they can make determinations about the opinions of people who generically are similar to you.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    If you ever see a survey that you do not wish to answer, exit the current session in your browser and come back PV at a later time.
    It will be removed from your account due to completion of the number of responses ordered by the Umongous client, and no longer
    appear when you log in to PV. Do not answer any survey which you do not wish to participate in.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Many of the surveys you will encounter while participating at PV exist for the purpose of identifying certain psychographic characteristics
    such as interests, activities, personal opinions and possessions. Umongous uses this information to direct certain surveys by Umongous Clients to you.
    For example, you might be asked if you own a pickup truck because a Umongous Client either does or doesn't wish to survey people who own pickup trucks.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Many questions asked in non-market-research surveys shown to you at PV are used by Umongous to make a determination about whether
    you are carefully reading questions and providing deliberate, consistent and candid answers. Your answers to these questions are used
    to determine whether Umongous will ask you to complete market research surveys. The magnitude of your opportunity to win monetary
    compensation on PV is largely predicated upon your level of activity on PV AND our determination of whether you are reading questions carefully
    and providing deliberate, consistent, candid answers. We use our proprietary algorithm "TraitScore" to make that determination.
    Umongous is always seeking to provide the highest quality service to its Clients and looks to you to be candid and truthful with your opinions.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Other information Collected by PV During Your Visits</h3>

  <p>
    PV automatically collects information and records in its database log files to help administer the site and aid in technical problem solving.
    Examples of log file information collected include IP address, time a page was viewed, your browser type, URL parameters, and information
    from cookies that were set by PV at the time of the visit. IP addresses are correlated with your declared location such as zip code.
    Use of proxy servers to mask your location is a violation of PV TOS (terms of service). It is important for PV to prevent users from
    creating and operating multiple accounts. Log file information is never linked to personal identifying information other than the information
    provided in your account profile.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Other Activities/Games on PV</h3>

  <p>
    As a member of PV you may optionally elect to participate in PredictionMatch contests. In order to participate you must login to
    PV using your Facebook account. While the PredictionMatch feature is activated for your PV account, you must always use your
    Facebook credentials at login. This will result in your Facebook profile photo being used as your avatar within PV and on your PredictionMatch
    profile page. That profile page is viewable by other members of PV. Your name as registered at Facebook will also appear on your PredictionMatch
    profile page and be viewable by others. Once you have activated PredictionMatch in your account, should you later decide to opt out,
    you must log in to your account and choose "opt out" within your profile settings. You may also choose to notify us by contacting PV
    at support [at] paidviewpoint [dot] com.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Your demographics and specific answers to questions in surveys or PredictionMatch contests will not be shared with anyone in a manner
    that can be linked to your personal identity. For instance, your household income that you supplied at registration will not be shared
    with anyone in a manner that can be personally linked to you. Your Facebook login credentials are never received nor stored on PV servers.
    Other members of PV can see your success in PredictionMatch contests.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Links to Other Web Sites</h3>

  <p>
    Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Umongous. If you submit
    personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you

  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">There are Times When We Learn Your Name or Other PIA</h3>

  <p>

    We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit. There are Other Times When We Learn
    Your Name or Other PIA We may learn your name on certain other occasions, but we do not then store it within PV
    databases or use it for any other purpose than to resolve a customer support issue initiated by you. For instance, if you send us an email,
    your name may be revealed to us in your email address, or because you have used your name in your email.
    If you post a message on our <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/paidviewpoint">Get Satisfaction</a> page you may choose
    to sign it with your real name. We do not encourage you to publicly reveal your name even though no third parties will be able
    to see your registration demographics or other personal information. When we send you money by PayPal.com, your name
    may be revealed to us in our Paypal account but we will not transfer your name from there to the PV database.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Customer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews/User Feedback</h3>

  <p>
    We post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our web sites, which may contain personally identifiable
    information. We do obtain the customer's consent to post their name along with their testimonial via email prior to
    posting the testimonial.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Inviting Friends to Join PV</h3>

  <p>
    When you invite a friend to subscribe or become a member of the PV using the tools provided to you by PV, a code
    will be provided to them to become linked to you in our PV database ("Linked"). Once linked to the friend that you referred
    (the "Referral"), you will become eligible to potentially receive a recruiting bonus. The user name and email address (supplied by you)
    of your invited friend may be shown to you in your profile.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    PV also utilizes a third party service, <a href="http://www.janrain.com/products/engage">Janrain Engage</a> to help facilitate
    Users' ability to invite Referrals and log into the Website using other social network website login credentials.
    Please refer to the <a href="http://www.janrain.com/janrain-privacy-policy">Janrain Privacy policy</a> for further details.
    The Company will not receive, see or store your third party social network passwords when you use the Janrain Engage widget
    on the Website. If you invite friends through the Janrain Engage widget we will not see their information or email addresses unless
    they register as a member of the Website as a result of your invitation. By using Janrain Engage, you may agree to allow us to publish
    information to your social network news feeds and profile pages. You can choose to bypass Janrain Engage by logging into the Website
    using your regular/default login credentials.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Data Security</h3>

  <p>
    PV has industry standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.
    These procedures are in place to secure PV member email addresses, anonymous demographics, psychographics and survey answers.
    PV members may access their demographics within their profile page for the purposes of verifying and updating. Under no circumstance
    can one member view the demographics of another member. As with any Internet endeavor, absolute security of information transmitted
    through channels (communication networks, hardware, software) not directly operated or controlled by us cannot be guaranteed.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    In the event PV and/or Umongous or its affiliates enters into a merger, acquisition, sale or other transaction pursuant to which PV, or
    any portion of Umongous assets is acquired by a third party or an affiliate of Umongous, your personal information may be disclosed to
    the third party or affiliate both before and after the transaction, for the sole purpose of facilitating the transfer of your account and
    effecting that transaction. In the event a transaction is consummated, you will be notified of the transaction via email and/or through
    a notice on our website, and custody of your personal information will be transferred subject to all the terms and restrictions in this
    privacy policy. In the event the transaction is not consummated, PV and Umongous will require the third party or affiliate not to use
    or disclose your personal information in any manner whatsoever and to completely erase the same.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    As is the case with any information you provide to any business operating in the United States, information provided to PV is subject to
    disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Policies on Correcting and Updating Personal Information</h3>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">You Can Decide at Any Time to End Participation</h3>

  <p>
    You can decline to respond to any survey by either selecting the "skip" button if available for non-market-research surveys or, if not
    available by logging out of a session when faced with a market research survey and then logging back in at a later time when it is
    no longer being shown to you. If you desire to cancel your membership in PV, please use the "Close account" button on the bottom of
    "Settings" page or contact us at support [at] paidviewpoint [dot] com. We will promptly cancel your account and delete your information
    from our database and send you a confirmation email. We respect your decision to decline participation and will not make any attempt to dissuade you.
  </p>

  <h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">Use of Cookies and tracking technology:</h2>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">How We Use Cookies &amp; Other Technologies on Our Website</h3>

  <p>
    PV uses cookies during your sessions. Cookies are used for technical purposes to allow for accurate transmission of survey information to the
    PV database and to ensure that a member does not take the same survey more than once. PV also uses cookies to help ensure that members
    abide by the rules of one account allowed per member.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    PV uses cookies to store user log in credentials automatically, if voluntarily elected by the user, to eliminate the necessity of having to repeatedly
    retype this information. For users' convenience, this cookie is stored for subsequent sessions. The PV web server also creates cookies to uniquely
    identify each user session when a member visits the site.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Because cookies are used to identify legitimate members and protect unauthorized access to their specific member information,
    users who choose not to allow cookies cannot register nor can they access the full features of PV such as opportunities to participate
    in market research survey or earn cash prizes.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Third Party Cookies</h3>

  <p>
    Our privacy statement does not cover the use of cookies by our analytics providers and service providers.
    We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for
    you to navigate our site and use our checkout process for payments. Our analytics supply tracking cookies to provide us with
    information on your navigation of our site for support purposes and marketing communications.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Web Beacons</h3>

  <p>
    Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to
    compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and
    links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">PV May Use Digital Fingerprinting</h3>

  <p>
    Digital fingerprinting is a technology used to place a unique identifier on a device such as a computer or smartphone.
    PV digital fingerprinting will never change the functionality of a device, collect personal information, or affect the operating
    system or its settings in any way. It will never log keystrokes or record activities. It will never interfere with or take control
    of the device. It will never send any information to the PV servers other than the device ID. It will never act as malware,
    adware, a virus or a Trojan. Its sole purpose is to match the device ID to the PV accounts logged into from the device.
    It is used to ensure the integrity of the market research results obtained on PV. It is also used to help prevent violations
    of the one account per PV member rule. PV uses commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that this technology is safe, secure
    and does not cause undue privacy or data security risks. PV will use and distribute this technology in an ethical manner in
    accordance with the PV privacy policy and all applicable laws.
  </p>

  <h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">Children's Privacy</h2>

  <p>
    The site is intended for adults in the United States. We do not intentionally or knowingly collect personally identifiable information
    from children under the age of 13 and we request that individuals under the age of 13 not submit any personal information on the site.
    If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has created an account at PV,
    we will promptly close that account and delete any submitted information.
  </p>

  <h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">How and When PV May Contact You</h2>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Uses of Information</h3>

  <p>
    When you register for an account on PV, you will be required to call us with your land line or cell phone or send us an SMS to
    provide PV with a secret validation code presented to you by PV. As a result of this process, we will learn your phone number.
    We populate your phone number into your account where you can see it and change it in the future.
    This validation procedure is designed to add security to your account and to limit PV members from creating multiple accounts.
    The same process must be repeated each time you cash out. We do use a third party application
    <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> to receive the confirmation codes from your phone and identify
    your phone number to our database. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy">Twilio Privacy Policy</a>
    for further details. At no other time does PV share your phone number with any third party or display it to others on the PV website.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Invitations</h3>

  <p>
    PV may send you an email from time to time to invite you to take a survey. You may opt-out from receiving PV
    emails by selecting the opt-out link in the email or on the "Settings" page.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Reminder Emails</h3>

  <p>
    PV may send you an email to remind you that you can return to the site to begin answering surveys. These reminder emails are sent
    at your specific request based upon a setting that you have made in your account. If you do not request another reminder be sent
    to you next time, then none will be sent. To change these settings on PV, please log into your account and click on the profile link
    in the top right-hand corner, then click on the settings tab where you can turn off these notifications.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Service-related Announcements</h3>

  <p>
    From time-to-time we may send you service-related transactional emails. You may opt-out from receiving these emails by
    selecting the opt-out link in the email.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Promotional Emails</h3>

  <p>
    Occasionally we may send you a promotional email concerning some feature, service or promotion directly related to PV
    or one of Umongous' related websites. You may opt-out from receiving these emails by selecting the opt-out link in the
    email. We will never send you a promotional email related to a product or service that is not part of the Umongous
    business and related websites.
  </p>

  <h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">How We Notify You About Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>
    If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and
    other places we deem appropriate, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
    circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material
    changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.

    cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, please contact
