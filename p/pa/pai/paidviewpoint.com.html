  <h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">Our Privacy Pledge:</h2>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">When you participate at PV as a member, your privacy is protected.</h3>

  <p>
    You will notice when you register at PV that we do not ask for your full name. We ask for a user name for the purpose of addressing you in emails and displaying your wins to our community on our home page and past winner's pages. You are free to supply a pseudonym on PV. We are not interested in your real name. We also do not ask for your precise address. Depending on your country of residence, you may need to supply your phone number in order to validate your account. In the US, we ask for your state, county and zip code. In other countries we may as for similar geographic and postal information, but not your precise address. We ask for your email address at registration. We will not rent, sell or share your email address with anyone without your expressed permission, except in the rare instances required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    You are able, at your option, to upload an avatar into your account. This is entirely voluntary. The avatar may be your true likeness or photo at your sole discretion. If you choose to upload an avatar, PV may from time to time display your avatar on publicly viewable portions of the website and label the avatar with your first name, first initial of your last name supplied at registration, and account winnings or cash out. Your avatar may be overlaid on a map and show your approximate registered location. Umongous will not share your avatar with Umongous Clients or associate it with any survey answers. Should you decline to upload an avatar, PV may on occasion display a stock avatar image along with your first name, first initial of last name and account winnings or cash out.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    If you use a social media login, such as Facebook, your social media profile photo and name will be shared with us through the relevant API. In those cases, PV will display your social media profile photo as your avatar on PV. Your true name, obtained from the API will also be displayed on your profile page within PV. Your registration demographics, such as your relationship status, household income, employment status, etc., will not be displayed on your PV profile page for others to see nor shared in a personally identifiable fashion with any third party at any time, with the exception of PV employees who may be required to service your account. Your precise answers to survey questions and traits questions will not be displayed on your PV profile page nor shared in a personally identifiable fashion, with any third party at any time with the exception of PV employees who may be required to service your account.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    We do share your anonymous demographics, which you supply during registration or periodically update, with our Clients, along with your survey answers. Although our Clients are not interested in your personal identity, theoretically (in unusual circumstances), there could be cases where our Clients might be able to determine your personal identity. An example would be if you live in a zip code with a very small population and your demographics are unique for that zip code. In practice, we are unaware of any of our Clients making this effort. Such an effort by Umongous Clients is against our policy and MR-TOS. Because our Umongous survey system is self-service, it is possible that one of our Clients could potentially violate our policies and MR-TOS and deploy a survey into PV that requests personally identifiable information ("PII"). We urge you not to answer any question in a market research survey that requests PII such as your real name, address, phone number, social security number or email address. If you see such a violation on PV, please report this violation to notification [at] paidviewpoint [dot] com.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Umongous will never try to sell you anything. We will never share, rent, sell or provide your email address to anyone else who might want to sell you anything. We are not in the lead generation business and it is against our MR-TOS for Umongous Clients to use our system and attempt to access you through PV for that purpose.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Your individual responses to surveys will also be kept confidential and will never be linked to your personal identifying information WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT Umongous does supply the demographics provided by you at registration and kept updated by you in your profile including state, county, zip code and inferred city or town. This information is supplied to Umongous Clients along with your survey answers so that they can make determinations about the opinions of people who generically are similar to you.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    If you ever see a survey that you do not wish to answer, exit the current session in your browser and come back PV at a later time. It will be removed from your account due to completion of the number of responses ordered by the Umongous Client, and no longer appear when you log in to PV. Do not answer any survey in which you do not wish to participate.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Many of the surveys you will encounter while participating at PV exist for the purpose of identifying certain psychographic characteristics such as interests, activities, personal opinions and possessions. Umongous uses this information to direct certain surveys by Umongous Clients to you. For example, you might be asked if you own a pickup truck because a Umongous Client either does or doesn't wish to survey people who own pickup trucks.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Many questions asked in non-market-research surveys shown to you at PV are used by Umongous to make a determination about whether you are carefully reading questions and providing deliberate, consistent and candid answers. Your answers to these questions are used to determine whether Umongous will ask you to complete market research surveys. The magnitude of your opportunity to win monetary compensation on PV is largely predicated upon your level of activity on PV AND our determination of whether you are reading questions carefully and providing deliberate, consistent, candid answers. We use our proprietary algorithm "TraitScore" to make that determination. Umongous is always seeking to provide the highest quality service to its Clients and looks to you to be candid and truthful with your opinions.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Other information Collected by PV During Your Visits</h3>

  <p>
    PV automatically collects information and records in its database log files to help administer the site and aid in technical problem solving. Examples of log file information collected include IP address, time a page was viewed, your browser type, URL parameters, and information from cookies that were set by PV at the time of the visit. IP addresses are correlated with your declared location such as zip code. Use of proxy servers to mask your location is a violation of PV terms of service ("TOS"). It is important for PV to prevent users from creating and operating multiple accounts. Log file information is never linked to personal identifying information other than the information provided in your account profile.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Other Activities/Games on PV</h3>

  <p>
    As a member of PV you may optionally elect to participate in PredictionMatch and other PV contests. In order to participate you may be required to login to PV using your Facebook account. This will result in your Facebook profile photo being used as your avatar within PV, in the "top score" charts and on your profile page unless you provided a separate avatar within your PV account. That profile page is viewable by other members of PV. Your name as registered at Facebook may also appear on your profile page and be viewable by others. Once you have activated contests in your account, should you later decide to opt out, you must log in to your account and choose "opt out" within your profile settings. You may also choose to notify us by contacting PV at support [at] paidviewpoint [dot] com.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Your demographics and specific answers to questions in surveys or PV contests will not be shared with anyone in a manner that can be linked to your personal identity. For instance, your household income that you supplied at registration will not be shared with anyone in a manner that can be personally linked to you. Your Facebook login credentials are never received nor stored on PV servers. Other members of PV can see your success in PV contests.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Links to Other Web Sites</h3>

  <p>
    Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Umongous. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.

  <br>

  <p>
    We may learn your name on certain other occasions, but we do not then store it within PV databases or use it for any other purpose than to resolve a customer support issue initiated by you. For instance, if you send us an email, your name may be revealed to us in your email address, or because you have used your name in your email. If you post a message on our <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/paidviewpoint" target="_blank">Get Satisfaction</a> page you may choose to sign it with your real name. We do not encourage you to publicly reveal your name even though no third parties will be able to see your registration demographics or other personal information. When we send you money by PayPal.com, your name may be revealed to us in our Paypal account but we will not transfer your name from there to the PV database.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Customer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews/User Feedback</h3>

  <p>
    We post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on Web sites owned or controlled by Umongous, which may contain PII. We do obtain the customer's consent via email to post their name along with their testimonial prior to posting the testimonial. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at privacy [at] paidviewpoint [dot] com.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Inviting Friends to Join PV</h3>

  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Data Security</h3>

  <p>
    PV has industry standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. These procedures are in place to secure PV member email addresses, anonymous demographics, psychographics and survey answers. PV members may access their demographics within their profile page for the purposes of verifying and updating. Under no circumstance can one member view the demographics of another member. As with any Internet endeavor, absolute security of information transmitted through channels (communication networks, hardware, software) not directly operated or controlled by us cannot be guaranteed.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>

In the event a transaction is consummated, you will be notified of the transaction via email and/or through a notice on our website, and custody of your personal information will be transferred subject to all the terms and restrictions in this privacy policy.

  </p>
  <br>

  </p>

  <h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">Use of Cookies and tracking technology:</h2>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">How We Use Cookies &amp; Other Technologies on Our Website</h3>

  <p>
    PV uses cookies during your sessions. Cookies are used for technical purposes to allow for accurate transmission of survey information to the PV database and to ensure that a member does not take the same survey more than once. PV also uses cookies to help ensure that members abide by the rules of one account allowed per member.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    PV uses cookies to store user login credentials automatically, if voluntarily elected by the user, to eliminate the necessity of having to repeatedly retype this information. For users' convenience, this cookie is stored for subsequent sessions. The PV web server also creates cookies to uniquely identify each user session when a member visits the site.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Because cookies are used to identify legitimate members and protect unauthorized access to their specific member information, users who choose not to allow cookies cannot register nor can they access the full features of PV such as opportunities to participate in market research survey or earn cash prizes.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Flash LSOs</h3>

  <p>
    We use local storage objects (LSOs) to store content information and preferences [or â€“ other uses]. Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use LSOs to collect and store information.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please click here: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</a>
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Third Party Cookies</h3>

  <p>
    Our privacy statement does not cover the use of cookies by our analytics providers and service providers. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and use our checkout process for payments.

  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Web Beacons</h3>

  <p>
    Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">PV May Use Digital Fingerprinting</h3>

  <p>
    Digital fingerprinting is a technology used to place a unique identifier on a device such as a computer or smartphone. PV digital fingerprinting will never change the functionality of a device, collect personal information, or affect the operating system or its settings in any way. It will never log keystrokes or record activities. It will never interfere with or take control of the device. It will never send any information to the PV servers other than the device ID. It will never act as malware, adware, a virus or a Trojan. Its sole purpose is to match the device ID to the PV accounts logged into from the device. It is used to ensure the integrity of the market research results obtained on PV. It is also used to help prevent violations of the one account per PV member rule. PV uses commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that this technology is safe, secure and does not cause undue privacy or data security risks. PV will use and distribute this technology in an ethical manner in accordance with the PV privacy policy and all applicable laws.
  </p>

  <h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">Children's Privacy</h2>

  <p>
    The site is intended for adults in the United States. We do not intentionally or knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 and we request that individuals under the age of 13 not submit any personal information on the site. If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has created an account at PV, we will promptly close that account and delete any submitted information.
  </p>

  <h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">How and When PV May Contact You</h2>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Uses of Information</h3>

  <p>
    When you register for an account on PV, you will be required to call us with your landline or cell phone or send us an SMS to provide PV with a secret validation code presented to you by PV. As a result of this process, we will learn your phone number. We populate your phone number into your account where you can see it and change it in the future. This validation procedure is designed to add security to your account and to limit PV members from creating multiple accounts. The same process must be repeated each time you cash out. We do use a third party application <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> to receive the confirmation codes from your phone and identify your phone number to our database. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy">Twilio Privacy Policy</a> for further details. At no other time does PV share your phone number with any third party or display it to others on the PV website.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Invitations</h3>

  <p>
    PV may send you an email from time to time to invite you to take a survey. You may opt-out from receiving PV emails by selecting the opt-out link in the email or on the "Settings" page.
  </p>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Reminder Emails</h3>

  <p>
    PV may send you an email to remind you that you can return to the site to begin answering surveys. These reminder emails are sent at your specific request based upon a setting that you have made in your account. If you do not request another reminder be sent to you next time, then none will be sent.
