      IF YOU ARE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION OR A COUNTRY WHICH IS GOVERNED BY THE GDPR, YOUR USE
      OF THE WEBSITE IS GOVERNED SEPARATELY BY OUR <a href="/pages/eu_privacy">EU PRIVACY POLICY</a>.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p class="white">
      PaidViewpoint.com (“Website”) is operated by Umongous, Inc. (“Umongous”, “we,” “us,” or “our”).
      Umongous is in the market research business. All visitors to the Website (“Users,” “you,” or “your”),
      including all Users who wish to become members (“Members,” or “Membership”) and participate in surveys or
      other market research opportunities (“Research”), must agree to this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”).
      Research may be performed by Umongous clients (“Clients”) or by Umongous itself.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p class="white">
      This Privacy Policy forms a part of the PaidViewpoint <a href="/pages/tos">Terms of Use</a> (“Terms”).
      Your Membership and your redemption of any Member Rewards are also governed by
      the <a href="/pages/rules">Rewards Rules</a>, which likewise form a part of the Terms.

    <br>

    <p class="white">
      THIS PRIVACY POLICY DISCLOSES HOW WE COLLECT, USE, SHARE, STORE, AND SECURE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN
      CONNECTION WITH THE WEBSITE. PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.
      THIS PRIVACY POLICY CONSTITUTES A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND UMONGOUS REGARDING YOUR
      USE OF THE WEBSITE AND YOUR MEMBERSHIP.

    <br>

    <p class="white">
      BY REGISTERING AS A MEMBER OR USING THE WEBSITE IN ANY WAY, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
      IF YOU CANNOT COMPLY OR DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THE WEBSITE.
      THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AND ANY RIGHTS AND LICENSES GRANTED HEREUNDER, MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED BY YOU,
      BUT MAY BE ASSIGNED BY UMONGOUS WITHOUT RESTRICTION OR NOTICE TO YOU.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p class="white">
      Umongous also owns and operates AYTM.com, a market research website where Clients utilize Research data obtained
      from Users as described below. Users of AYTM.com are subject to the separate
      Terms of Use and Privacy Policy posted there.
    </p>
    <br>
  <p></p>
  <br>

  <h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">1. What we do:</h2>
  <br>

  <p>
    Umongous is in the market research and opinion research business.
    Umongous operates the Website for the purpose of gaining anonymous opinions in order to help
    its Clients gain a better understanding of their business, marketing, product development and
    strategic opportunities. In order to function as a market research business,
    we collect your demographic traits (see Section 2 below).
    We also collect your anonymous self-declared traits (we call these “Trait Surveys”)
    for the purposes of (i) directing specific surveys to you and (ii) sharing aggregated,
    anonymous traits associated with answers chosen by the pool of people who answered a survey.
    Your answers to the questions in the Trait Surveys are used to determine your various social,
    psychological, political, psychographic and preference attributes as a Member (see below under "Trait Information").
  </p><p>
  <br>

  </p><p>
    We do not share your name or email address with our Clients.
    It is a violation of the Terms of Use at AYTM.com for a Client to
    seek to determine the individual identity of any Member.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    If you decide that you do not wish to answer a survey or an individual question in a survey,
    you can simply end your participation in the survey, and the survey will be cleared from your account,
    typically in a few hours or days. You will not receive payment for an incomplete survey. See Section 8 below.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">2. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">2.A. Information We Collect Directly from You</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Initial Registration Information:</strong> If you wish to become a Member, you must submit your email address and a
    chosen password. If you choose to register by using a third-party account (such as Google or Facebook),
    please see <a href="#2_b_information_section">Section 2.B</a> below.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>Standard Demographic Information:</strong> To continue the registration you will be asked to provide what we call
    "Standard Demographic Information." This may include but will not necessarily be limited to gender, user name,
    first name, last name, birthdate, country, state/region, county, street address, zip/postal code, time zone,
    PayPal email address, level of education, relationship status, parental status, employment status,
    and chosen career. You have the option to also supply your household income and race/ethnicity.
    In all cases, you know what information we collect from you because you are providing it to us directly.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>Telephone Number and PayPal Information:</strong> When you register for an account on the Website, and sometimes
    when you redeem Rewards, you may be required to call us with your landline or cell phone or send us an SMS
    to provide us with a secret validation code presented to you by us. As a result of this process,
    we will learn your phone number and will include it in your Membership account.
    We also request your PayPal account information so we can make payments which may be due to you.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>Trait Information:</strong> You will receive many short surveys which enable us to learn more about you.
    We call these “Trait Surveys.” Trait Surveys may seek information about your health and medical conditions,
    racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union memberships, health,
    psychographic, psychological makeup and sex life, things you have purchased, own or plan to acquire, etc.
    Your answers to Trait Survey questions are only supplied to Clients in aggregate form,
    and only to Clients whose surveys you’ve answered. If you do not wish to answer any particular question(s)
    in a given Trait Survey, you can click the “Exit” button. You will not be remunerated for a
    Trait Survey which you do not complete.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>Umongous Client Survey Information:</strong> You may occasionally be given an opportunity to participate in a survey created
    by a Client, or by Umongous itself. We collect and store the responses that you submit to these surveys.
    This information may include photos of you, video recordings of you and sharing your screen activity.
    When a Client created the survey, it is the Client who is responsible for the information
    and questions included in the survey. It is a violation of the AYTM Terms of Service for a Umongous Client to ask you
    for personally identifiable information. If a Client survey asks you to provide personal information such as your name,
    address, phone number, social security number or email address, we urge you not to provide this information.
    If you see a survey containing such questions, please notify us at <span class="a_link">privacy [at] PaidViewpoint [dot] com</span>.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    If you decide that you do not wish to answer a question or otherwise complete a survey,
    you can click the “Exit” button to leave the survey. You will not receive remuneration for
    Client Surveys which you do not complete.

  </p>
  <br>

    your name and country and we store this data on our servers for fraud prevention purposes.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>Other Information You Choose to Share:</strong> We may collect any other personal
    information or data if you voluntarily submit it to us.

  <br>

  <h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">2.C. Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>

  <p>
    We, as well as our research, technology, and marketing partners, affiliates, analytics services,

    Cookies are small amounts of data which are sent to your browser from a website’s computers
    and stored on your computer or device. For more information about how we use cookies, and your

    which is incorporated herein by this reference.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>To Provide You the Services:</strong> We use the information from Trait Surveys to determine whether you are carefully
    reading questions and providing deliberate, consistent and candid answers.
    This helps us decide whether or not to include you in our Clients’ surveys.
    We also include questions to identify certain psychographic characteristics such as interests, activities,
    personal opinions and possessions. This helps us to better direct surveys to you.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>To Invite You to Take a Survey:</strong> We may send you an email or SMS message to invite you to take a survey.
    You may opt out from receiving such emails by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of each email
    or selecting the opt-out link on the “Settings” page, and you may opt out from such SMS messages by replying “STOP”.
    This will not stop other communications from us which may be necessary to provide you the services.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>Service-Related Announcements:</strong> From time to time we may send you emails related
    to the services we’re providing to you. You may not opt out from receiving these
    emails without closing your Member account.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>Invitations to Additional Market Research Studies:</strong> You may be asked in a survey whether you have interest
    in participating in additional market research, such as a phone interview, a product test or user experience study.
    If you elect to be considered for such study, we may contact you so that you can participate.
    There will be an additional opportunity to opt out of the study at that point.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>Marketing and Advertising:</strong> We may contact you to offer additional services or promotions directly related
    to the Website or one of Umongous’ related websites. You may opt out of receiving promotional communications
    at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in them. This will not stop other communications
    from us which may be necessary to provide you the services.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>To Provide you Support:</strong> This includes providing you with technical support and administering your account.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>To Maintain, Monitor and improve Our Services:</strong> We use usage and other information to help maintain our Website
    and to analyze how you use the Website and other services, including how you interact with different
    parts of the Website, and whether you open emails or click on links in them.
    This enables us to assess the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, to determine products
    that are suitable for you, and to improve our Website and services and your experience with them.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>To Maintain the Safety and Security of Our Services:</strong> We may use your information for internal purposes designed
    to keep our services secure and operational, such as for troubleshooting and testing purposes.
    We may also use your information to verify with a third-party service provider that your email
    and mailing address correspond to a real individual.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>To Prevent Illegal or Abusive Conduct:</strong> We use your information as necessary to enforce our Terms of Use
    and this Privacy Policy, to help prevent illicit or illegal use of the Website or the services,
    and to screen for and prevent undesirable or abusive activity. In addition,
    we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond to legal requests or subpoenas.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>Email address and Avatar:</strong> We will not rent, sell or share your email address with anyone without your
    express permission or under the circumstances set forth in the "Law Enforcement" section below.
    We will not share your avatar with Umongous Clients or associate it with any survey answers.
    We will share your user name and avatar but not your email address with the User who referred you to us (if any).
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>Your Survey Responses:</strong> We share your survey responses with our Clients whose surveys you answered.
    The Clients may share these responses with third parties at their discretion.
    When you answer a research survey we provide the Client your answers, your standard demographic information,
    and your location down to the zip code level. We do not provide your street address, name, avatar,
    phone number or email address. We do not share your IP address,
    but we do let Clients see on a map approximately where you live.
    Although we do not directly share your identity, there is always a possibility that Clients,
    and/or other third parties with whom Clients share this information, would be able to deduce your identity,
    for example if your zip code is sparsely populated and/or
    if the combination of your demographics and survey answers are very unique.
    We may also share your survey responses with employees, service providers,
    and other third parties as described below.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>Employees, Service Providers, and Other Third Parties:</strong> Our employees may access your complete responses
    together with any personally identifiable information we collected about you (see above)
    to the extent necessary to perform their jobs and to service your account.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    We also share restricted portions of your information with third parties who help us to provide you
    with our services including payment processors, hosting services, email service providers, data matching,
    communications providers, web traffic analytics tools and a web telephony provider to receive the confirmation codes
    from your phone and identify your phone number to our database (Twilio),
    and with other third parties who assist us in providing services but are bound by confidentiality agreements.
    We grant these providers access to limited portions of your information, only to the extent necessary
    for them to perform their services to us. We also implement reasonable contractual and technical measures to ensure
    that your personal information is protected, used only for the provision of their services to us,
    and processed consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We use certain portions of the information
    that you supplied when you registered to confirm with industry standard third-party service providers
    that you are who you claim to be. If these services report back to us that you are unlikely to be
    the identity you claimed, we will not allow you to participate in market research surveys.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>Merger, Transactions, Bankruptcy:</strong> In the event that Umongous or its affiliates (i) undergoes a corporate
    restructuring; (ii) enters into a merger, acquisition, sale or other transaction pursuant to which Umongous
    or any portion of its assets or stock is acquired by or assigned to a third party; or (iii) is involved
    in a bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, liquidation, similar transaction or proceedings, your personal
    information, including the questions and answers of your surveys and Research participation,
    may be among the items sold or otherwise transferred and may be shared with third parties, including buyers,
    service providers or law enforcement officials.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>Law Enforcement:</strong> We will share your information with law enforcement, government officials,
    or other third parties (i) if we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure;
    (ii) if we need to do so to comply with law; (iii) if we believe in good faith that the disclosure of your personal
    information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity;
    (iv) to enforce this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, or to protect the security or integrity of our Services;
    and/or (v) to defend against legal claims or demands, exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal
    safety of Umongous, our Users or others.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <strong>Per Your Express Consent:</strong> We may share your information for other reasons
    or purposes if you provide your permission for us to do so.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">5. Links to Other Web Sites</h2>
  <br>

  <p>
    Our Website may include links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Umongous.
    If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed
    by the privacy policies associated with those websites. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies of
    any websites you visit.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">6. Data Retention</h2>
  <br>

  <p>
    We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you our services,
    or as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
    Even when we delete the information, keep in mind that the deletion by our third-party providers may not be
