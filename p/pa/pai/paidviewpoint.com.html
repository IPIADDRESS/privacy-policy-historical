<h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">Our Privacy Pledge:</h2>

<h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">When you participate at ICS as a member, your privacy is assured.</h3>

<p>
  You will notice when you register at ICS or PV that we do not ask for your full name. We ask for a user name for the
  purpose of addressing you in emails and displaying your wins to our community on our home page and past winners pages.
  You are free to supply a pseudonym as your first name and initial on ICS and a pseudonym on PV. We are not interested
  in your real name. We also do not ask for your precise address. We ask for your state, county and zip code. We ask for
  your email address at registration. We will not rent, sell or share your email address with anyone without your
  expressed permission, except in the rare instances required by law.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  You are able, at your option, to upload an avatar into your account. This is entirely voluntary. The avatar may be
  your true likeness or photo at your sole discretion. If you choose to upload an avatar, ICS and PV may from time to
  time display your avatar on publicly viewable portions of the website and label the avatar with your first name, first
  initial of last name supplied at registration and account winnings or cash out. Your avatar may be overlaid on a
  <a href="http://www.instantcashsweepstakes.com/map" target="_blank">map</a> of the United States and show your
  approximate registered location such as a region in your state. The map has names of states but does not have cities
  labeled. Umongous will not share your avatar with Umongous clients or associate it with any survey answers. Should you
  decline to upload an avatar, ICS and PV may on occasion display a stock avatar image along with your first name, first
  initial of last name and account winnings or cash out.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  We do share your anonymous demographics, which you supply during registration or periodically update, with our
  clients, along with your survey answers. Although our clients are not interested in your personal identity, and we do
  not record your full name, address or phone number, theoretically (in unusual circumstances), there could be cases
  where our clients might be able to determine your personal identity. An example would be if you live in a zip code
  with a very small population and your demographics are unique for that zip code. In practice, we are unaware of any of
  our clients making this effort. Such an effort by Umongous clients is against our policy and MR-TOS. Because our
  Umongous survey system is self-service, it is possible that one of our clients could potentially violate our policies
  and MR-TOS and deploy a survey into ICS that requests personally identifiable information (PIA). We urge you not to
  answer any question in a market research survey that requests PIA such as your real name, address, phone number,
  social security number or email address. If you see such a question in a survey on ICS, please report this violation
  to us at privacy [at] instantcashsweepstakes [dot] com. If you see such a violation on PV, please report this
  violation to
  notification [at] paidviewpoint [dot] com.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  Umongous will never try to sell you anything. We will never share, rent, sell or provide your email address to anyone
  else who might want to sell you anything. We are not in the lead generation business and it is against our MR-TOS for
  Umongous clients to use our system and attempt to access you through ICS or PV for that purpose.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  Your individual responses to surveys will also be kept confidential and will never be linked to your personal
  identifying information WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT Umongous does supply the demographics supplied by you at registration
  and kept updated by you in your profile including state, county, zip code and inferred city or town. This information
  is supplied to Umongous clients along with your survey answers so that they can make determinations about the opinions
  of people who generically are similar to you.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  If you ever see a survey that you do not wish to answer, exit the current session in your browser and come back to ICS
  or PV at a later time. It will be removed from your account due to completion of the number of responses ordered by
  the Umongous client, and no longer appear when you log in to ICS or PV. Do not answer any survey which you do not wish
  to participate in.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  Many of the surveys you will encounter while participating at ICS and PV exist for the purpose of identifying certain
  psychographic characteristics such as interests, activities, personal opinions and possessions. Umongous uses this
  information to direct certain surveys by Umongous clients to you. For example, you might be asked if you own a pickup
  truck because a Umongous client either does or doesn't wish to survey people who own pickup trucks.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  Many questions asked in non-market-research surveys shown to you at ICS and PV are used by Umongous to make a
  determination about whether you are carefully reading questions and providing deliberate, consistent and candid
  answers. Your answers to these questions are used to determine whether Umongous will ask you to complete market
  research surveys. The magnitude of your opportunity to win prizes at ICS and monetary compensation on PV is largely
  predicated upon your level of activity at ICS and PV AND our determination of whether you are reading questions
  carefully and providing deliberate, consistent, candid answers. We use our proprietary algorithm "TraitScore" to make
  that determination. Umongous is always seeking to provide the highest quality service to its clients and looks to you
  to be candid and truthful with your opinions.
</p>

<h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Other information Collected by ICS and PV During Your Visits</h3>

<p>
  ICS automatically collects information and records in its database log files to help administer the site and aid in
  technical problem solving. Examples of log file information collected include IP address, time a page was viewed, your
  browser type, URL parameters, and information from cookies that were set by ICS and PV at the time of the visit. IP
  addresses are correlated with your declared location such as zip code. Use of proxy servers to mask your location is a
  violation of ICS and PV TOS (terms of service). It is important for ICS to prevent users from creating and operating
  multiple accounts. Log file information is never linked to personal identifying information other than the information
  provided in your account profile.
</p>

<h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Links to Other Web Sites</h3>

<p>
  Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Umongous. If you submit
  personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you
  to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.
</p>

<h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">There are Times When We Learn Your Name or Other PIA</h3>

<p>
  We may learn your name on certain occasions, but we do not store it within the ICS and PV databases or use it for any
  other purpose than to resolve a customer support issue initiated by you. For instance, if you send us an email, your
  name may be revealed to us in your email address, or because you have used your name in your email. If you post a
  message on our
  <a href="http://blog.instantcashsweepstakes.com/">blog</a> or
  <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/instantcashsweepstakescom">Get Satisfaction</a> page, you may choose to sign it
  with your real name. We do not encourage you to publically reveal your name even though no 3rd parties will be able to
  see your registration demographics or other personal information. When we send you money by PayPal.com, your name may
  be revealed to us in our Paypal account but we will not transfer your name to the ICS or PV database. We have no
  interest in knowing your personal identity.
</p>

<h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Customer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews/User Feedback</h3>

<p>
  We post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our web sites, which may contain personally identifiable
  information. We do obtain the customer's consent to post their name along with their testimonial via email prior to
  posting the testimonial.
</p>

<h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Inviting Friends to Join ICS</h3>

<p>
  When you invite a friend to join ICS using the tools provided to you by ICS, a code will be shared with them in order
  to link them to you in our database, so that you can receive matched wins as stated in our
  <a href="/pages/rules">rules</a>. The first name and first initial of their last name that they use in their
  registration will be shown to you in your profile section entitled: "My Friends (already invited)". There you will be
  able to see their first name, initial and details of matched wins events. When you answer fun surveys (non-market
  research surveys), you will be able to see the answer choices of your invited friends shown anonymized in aggregate.
  If you have only one invited friend, they will not effectively be anonymized. The same is true for you if you are the
  only invited friend of another ICS member. If you are uncomfortable with supplying an answer for a fun survey because
  of this, select the skip button and don't answer that survey.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  ICS also utilizes a third party service, Janrain Engage to facilitate inviting friends and logging into ICS using your
  other social website login credentials such as your Facebook login. Please refer to the Janrain Privacy policy for
  further details. ICS does not receive, see or store your third party website login credentials when you use the
  Janrain widget on ICS. If you invite friends through the widget we do not see their information or email addresses
  unless they register with ICS as a result of your invitation. Janrain Engage allows ICS to publish information to your
  social news feeds and profile pages at these websites based upon your permission and the rules of those sites. You can
  choose to bypass Janrain Engage simply by logging into ICS using your ICS login credentials.
</p>

<h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Inviting Friends to Join PV</h3>

<p>
  When you invite a friend to subscribe or become a member of the Website using the tools provided to you by Company, a
  code will be provided to them to become linked to you in our Website database ("Linked"). Once linked, to the friend
  that you referred (the "Referral"), you will become eligible to potentially receive a recruiting bonus. The user name
  and email address (supplied by you) of your invited friend may be shown to you in your profile. Company also utilizes
  a third party service, Janrain Engage to help facilitate Users' ability to invite Referrals and log into the Website
  using other social network website login credentials. Please refer to the Janrain Privacy policy for further details.
  The Company will not receive, see or store your third party social network login credentials when you use the Janrain
  Engage widget on the Website. If you invite friends through the Janrain Engage widget we will not see their
  information or email addresses unless they register as a member of the Website as a result of your invitation. By
  using Janrain Engage, you may agree to allow us to publish information to your social network news feeds and profile
  pages. You can choose to bypass Janrain Engage by logging into the Website using your regular/default login
  credentials.
</p>

<h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Data Security</h3>

<p>
  ICS has industry standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information
  under our control. These procedures are in place to secure ICS member email addresses, anonymous demographics,
  psychographics and survey answers. ICS members may access their demographics within their profile page for the
  purposes of verifying and updating. Under no circumstance can one member view the demographics of another member. As
  with any Internet endeavor, absolute security of information transmitted through channels (communication networks,
  hardware, software) not directly operated or controlled by us cannot be guaranteed.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  In the event ICS, PV and/or Umongous or its affiliates enters into a merger, acquisition, sale or other transaction
  pursuant to which ICS and/or PV, or any portion of Umongous assets is acquired by a third party or an affiliate of
  Umongous, your personal information may be disclosed to the third party or affiliate both before and after the
  transaction, for the sole purpose of facilitating the transfer of your account and effecting that transaction. In the
  event a transaction is consummated, you will be notified of the transaction via email and/or through a notice on our
  website, and custody of your personal information will be transferred subject to all the terms and restrictions in
  this privacy policy. In the event the transaction is not consummated, ICS, PV and Umongous will require the third
  party or affiliate not to use or disclose your personal information in any manner whatsoever and to completely erase
  the same.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  As is the case with any information you provide to any business operating in the United States, information provided
  to ICS and/or PV is subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.
</p>

<h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Policies on Correcting and Updating Personal Information</h3>

<h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">Opt Out Policy:</h2>

<p>
  You can decline to respond to any survey by either selecting the "skip" button for non-market-research surveys or

  cancellations [at] instantcashsweepstakes [dot] com. IF you desire to cancel your membership in PV, please contact us

  database and
  send you a confirmation email. We respect your decision to decline participation and will not make any attempt to
  dissuade you.
</p>

<h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">Use of Cookies and tracking technology:</h2>

<h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">How We Use Cookies &amp; Other Technologies on Our Website</h3>

<p>
  ICS and PV use cookies during your sessions. Cookies are used for technical purposes to allow for accurate
  transmission of survey information to the ICS database and to ensure that a member does not take the same survey more
  than once. ICS and PV also use cookies to help ensure that members abide by the rules of one account allowed per
  member.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  ICS and PV use cookies to store user login credentials automatically, if voluntarily elected by the user, to eliminate
  the necessity of having to repeatedly retype this information. For users' convenience, this cookie is stored for
  subsequent sessions. The ICS web server also creates cookies to uniquely identify each user session when a member
  visits the site.
</p>
<br>

<p>
  Because cookies are used to identify legitimate members and protect unauthorized access to their specific member
  information, users who choose not to allow cookies cannot register nor can they access the full features of ICS and PV
  such as opportunities to participate in market research survey or earn cash prizes.
</p>

<h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Third Party Cookies</h3>

<p>
  Our privacy statement does not cover the use of cookies by our analytics providers and service providers. We do not

<h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">ICS and PV May Use Digital Fingerprinting</h3>

<p>
  Digital fingerprinting is a technology used to place a unique identifier on a device such as a computer or smartphone.
  ICS and PV digital fingerprinting will never change the functionality of a device, collect personal information, or
  affect the operating system or its settings in any way. It will never log keystrokes or record activities. It will
  never interfere with or take control of the device. It will never send any information to the ICS servers other than
  the device ID. It will never act as malware, adware, a virus or a Trojan. Its sole purpose is to match the device ID
  to the ICS or PV accounts logged into from the device. It is used to ensure the integrity of the market research
  results obtained at ICS and PV. It is also used to help prevent violations of the one account per ICS or PV member
  rule. ICS and PV use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that this technology is safe, secure and does not cause
  undue privacy or data security risks. ICS and PV will use and distribute this technology in an ethical manner in
  accordance with the ICS privacy policy and all applicable laws.
</p>

<p>
  The site is intended for adults in the United States. We do not intentionally or knowingly collect personally
  identifiable information from children under the age of 13 and we request that individuals under the age of 13 not
  submit any personal information on the site. If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has created an
  account at ICS or PV, we will promptly close that account and delete any submitted information.

<h2 class="tk-myriad-pro">How and When ICS and PV May Contact You</h2>

<h3 class="tk-myriad-pro">Uses of Information</h3>

<p>
  On PV only - During the registration process we will require your telephone number to identify your account as unique

  once to verify the account. When you register for your account we will send a confirmation code to your phone. This
  code is entered into your account to confirm validity of your phone number.

<p>
  The only other use of this phone number is to verify a payout request made from your active account. When you log onto
  your account and request a payout to PayPal, a confirmation code is sent to your phone. This confirmation code must be
  entered into your account to effectuate the payout. We do use a third party application to dial and send the
  confirmation code to your phone. At no other time or function on PV is your phone number used or shared.
