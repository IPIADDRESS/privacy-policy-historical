            <p>Shortened URL's; URL shortening is a technique used on the web to shorten URL's (Uniform Resource
                Locators) to
                something substantially shorter. This technique is especially used in social media and looks similar to
                this
                (example: http://bit.ly). Users should take caution before clicking on shortened URL links and verify
                their authenticity before proceeding.</p>

                when
                engaging with us on social media.</p>
            <p>There may be instances where our website features social sharing buttons, which help share web content
                directly
                from web pages to the respective social media platforms. You use social sharing buttons at your own
                discretion
                and accept that doing so may publish content to your social media profile feed or page. You can find
                further
                information about some social media privacy and usage policies in the resources section below. </p>
