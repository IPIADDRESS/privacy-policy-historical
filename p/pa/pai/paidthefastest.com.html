      <ol type="a">
      <li>We are required by law to release member information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes</li>

    </li>
    </ol>
  <li>CO-REGISTRATION</li>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Definition</strong>  PaidTheFastest offer pages may contain co-registration checkboxes, where members can choose to "co-register" for other Web Sites during their registration with PaidTheFastest by checking the checkbox next to the co-registration Offer. Members are not required to select any co-registration boxes to join PaidTheFastest ; however, they may be required to do so in order to qualify for Signup Bonus(es) and/or other promotions.</li>
    <li><strong>Information Sharing</strong>  When a member co-registers for an Offer by checking the co-registration checkbox, any information they provide to PaidTheFastest may be shared with the Advertiser associated with the co-registration Offer. PaidTheFastest cannot control what Advertisers subsequently do with that information.</li>
    </ol>
  <li>COOKIES</li>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Referral and Affiliate Tracking</strong>  PaidTheFastest uses cookies in order to track new member registrations and offer completions. This ensures members are properly credited for referring other members and completing offers, as well as to track earnings for our Affiliates.</li>
    <li><strong>Cookies</strong>  Cookies used by PaidTheFastest can only be seen by PaidTheFastest, and cannot in any way cause harm to your computer. Because we cannot properly track member actions without the use of Cookies (to ensure members are credited for completing Offers, referring friends, etc), our Web Site will not function properly for members who have disabled Cookies.</li>
