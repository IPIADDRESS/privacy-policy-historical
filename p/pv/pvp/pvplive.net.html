    <p>Welcome to the web site www.pvplive.net, and any other web sites, applications, or services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "PVP Live Service"), which sites, applications or services are operated or produced by Live Productions, LLC ("PVP Live"). PVP Live values the privacy of the users, subscribers, publishers, members, and others who visit and use the PVP Live Service (collectively or individually, "You" or "Users") and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you.</p>

    <p>By agreeing to this Privacy Policy in your PVP Live account setup, or by using the PVP Live Service, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this notice.</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to PVP Live's collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name, address, phone number, or email address). It also describes generally PVP Live's practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).</p>

    <strong>The Information PVP Live Collects</strong>
    <p>User-provided Information : You may provide to PVP Live what is generally called "personal information" in the USA and elsewhere or "personal data" in the European Union (such as your name, email address, postal mailing address, home/mobile telephone number, credit card number and billing information) if you register for a PVP Live Service, or upload, purchase, view or download certain content or products from the PVP Live Service, enter contests or sweepstakes, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the PVP Live Service.</p>

    <p>"Cookies" Information : When you access the PVP Live Service, we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer. For information about what cookies are, how they work, how PVP Live uses them and how to remove them, please see our <a href="#">cookie policy</a>.</p>

    <p>"Automatically Collected" Information : When you access the PVP Live Service or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using cookies and other types of tracking technologies. This "automatically collected" information may include Internet Protocol address (" IP Address "), a unique user ID, device type, device identifiers, browser types and language, referring and exit pages, platform type, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the PVP Live Service, the number of clicks, the amount of time spent on pages, the dates and times that you visit the PVP Live Service, and other similar information. Depending on the law of your country of residence, your IP address may legally be considered personal information.</p>

    <p>Information from Other Sources : We may obtain information, including personal information, from third parties and sources other than the PVP Live Service, such as advertisers or social media networks for which you have approved our access to information (e.g., information from your Facebook account provided by the Facebook APIs). When you access the PVP Live Service through social media networks or when you connect a PVP Live Service to social media networks, you are authorizing PVP Live to collect, store and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may also obtain information from third parties such as social entertainment platforms regarding your use of such services, including about your use of the content you choose to broadcast through the PVP Live Service. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that we collect through the PVP Live Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <strong>The Way PVP Live Uses Information</strong>

    <p>PVP Live uses the information that you provide or that we collect from or about you: to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the PVP Live Service; to improve your experience with the PVP Live Service by delivering content which we hope you will find relevant and interesting, including advertising and marketing messages; to allow you to comment on content, and participate in online games, contests or rewards programs; and as necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or other similar legal obligations around the world.</p>

    <p>We will use your email address for administrative communications such as notifying you of major PVP Live Service updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, or to contact you regarding any content that you have posted to or downloaded from the PVP Live Service.</p>

    <p>PVP Live may periodically send promotional materials or notifications to you related to the PVP Live Service. If you want to stop receiving promotional materials, you can unsubscribe at the bottom of each email. If you have installed a mobile app and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, you can change the settings either on your mobile device or through the app.
  PVP Live uses the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the PVP Live Service works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.</p>

    <p>PVP Live may use "Automatically Collected" information and "Cookies" information to maintain and improve the PVP Live Service, including to do the following things: (a) automatically update the PVP Live application on your system; (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the PVP Live Service; (c) provide customized third-party advertisements, content and information; (d) monitor the effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns; (e) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and (f) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.</p>

    <strong>When PVP Live Discloses Information</strong>

    <p>PVP Live does not share your personal information with other organizations for their own marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent. Please be aware, however, that any personal information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the PVP Live Service - such as when you publish content, comments or profile information - becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others.</p>

    <p>If you connect to a third party service (such as Facebook or Twitter) through an icon or link on the PVP Live Service or otherwise link your PVP Live account with a third party service, we may share the contents of your post and associated information (such as your user name, the fact that your connection originated from the PVP Live Service, and other relevant usage and diagnostic information) with such third party.  We may also send information about the content you watch and your activities on the PVP Live Service to such third parties. Once such information is shared, the use of your information will be subject to that service's privacy policy and this Privacy Policy will not apply.</p>

    <p>PVP Live may disclose Automatically Collected and other aggregate non-personal information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, or other functionality of PVP Live.</p>

    <p> PVP Live may make both personal and non-personal information available to subsidiaries and affiliated companies that are under common ownership or control within the PVP Live family.</p>

    <p>We may disclose both personal and non-personal information to service providers working on our behalf to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfil orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist PVP Live in improving the PVP Live Service and creating new services features. We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize them to use the information only for the purposes for which it is provided to them, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.</p>

    <p>PVP Live may disclose User information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with US state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or other applicable laws around the world (for example, in the country of your residence); or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner legally required by the requesting entity.
  PVP Live also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith and after making reasonable enquiries, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability to PVP Live; protect PVP Live from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations to protect the security or integrity of the PVP Live Service; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of PVP Live, our Users, or others. We will notify you of these disclosures if we reasonably think we can do so legally and without harming the purpose of the disclosure.</p>

  <strong>Your Choices</strong>

  <p>You may, of course, decline to share your personal information with PVP Live, in which case PVP Live will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the PVP Live Service. If you would like to access, review, correct, update, suppress, or otherwise limit our use of your personal information you have previously provided directly to us, you may contact us as outlined in the last section of this Privacy Policy titled "PVP Live Contact Information "; or using the mechanism provided below. In your request, please include your email address, name, address, and telephone number and specify clearly what information you would like to access, change, update, or suppress. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and any information you give us will be protected by this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <p>You may update, correct, or delete certain of your user information and preferences by visiting the Settings Page once you have logged in to the PVP Live Service. You may also request to update, correct, delete the personal information you have provided to us by contacting us.</p>

  <p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</p>

  <strong>Advertisers and Analytics Providers</strong>

  <p>We may use third-party Web analytics services on our site, including but not limited to, such as those of Google Analytics and Mixpanel.  These service providers use a variety of tracking technologies such as cookies to analyze how users use the PVP Live Service.  The information collected will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the PVP Live Service.</p>

  <p>PVP Live may allow advertisers, third-party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within the PVP Live Service and other PVP Live sites, services and software. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements, and to collect and track information such as demographic information, inferred interests, aggregated information, and activity to assist them in personalizing the advertising content delivered to you. PVP Live does not provide your personal information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks PVP Live to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, males age 15 to 18) or audience segment (for example, males age 15 to 18 who have participated in certain promotions) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach.</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of, those other advertisers, third-party advertising networks, or third-party advertising servers. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these advertisers, third-party advertising networks, or third-party advertising servers. For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see http://www.aboutads.info/consumers , and to opt-out of such ad networks' and services' advertising practices, go to the  Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page, the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out page, or the Your Online Choices page.</p>

  <p>Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p>

  <strong>Our Commitment to Data Security</strong>

  <p> PVP Live uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical measures designed to protect the integrity and security of your personal information. However, no security precautions or systems can be completely secure. We cannot therefore ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to PVP Live, and you do so at your own risk.
