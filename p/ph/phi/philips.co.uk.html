Philips appreciates the interest you have shown in our company, products and services by visiting our websites, <a href="http://www.philips.com/">www.philips.com</a> or related communication channels, including, but not limited to, our social media pages and/or channels and blogs (together "Philips Pages").

However, some Philips Pages collections work with special kinds of data (for example, medical data), which require a somewhat different privacy notice. Whenever and wherever that is the case, Philips will make it clear that the privacy notice concerned is different from this general Privacy Notice.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Why we ask you to share your Personal Data</h3><p class="MsoNormal">We ask you to share your personal data with us for purposes including, but not limited to:</p><ul><li><div>Buying Philips products online;</div></li><li><div>Activating or registering certain products or enhancing functionality;</div></li><li><div>Receiving information about Philips products and services;</div></li><li><div>Participating in Philips online communities, including our social media channels/pages and blogs;</div></li><li><div>Storing your preferences for future interactions and communications from Philips;</div></li><li><div>Helping us to develop products and create campaigns that are designed around you, optimise customer services and continuously improve our websites;</div></li><li><div>Helping us to improve products and services, and allowing Philips to keep you informed of, or involve you in testing of, new products and services;</div></li><li><div>Resolving consumer and/or product issues;</div></li><li><div>Receiving personalised messages, special offers and advertisements that are relevant to your personal interests, based on the information you have shared with us and on the information we have collected through cookies or similar techniques regarding your use of the Philips websites/social media/blogs.

Personal data may also reach us when we purchase another company of which you are a customer. If you do not want Philips to use your personal data that has not been provided by you, you may let us know at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@philips.com">privacy@philips.com</a>.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Sharing your Personal Data with others</h3><p class="MsoNormal">We may share your personal data with service providers, business partners and other third parties, in accordance with applicable law.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">For example, Philips may sell you a product or offer you a service in a joint marketing effort with another company (Business Partner). We will let you know that such a relationship exists and who these companies are prior to processing your data for such joint marketing efforts.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">If we are required by law to obtain your consent, or otherwise believe that your consent is appropriate in the circumstances, we will obtain your consent before we share your personal data.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The agreements with these Business Partners will limit the purposes for which your personal data can be used and disclosed, and will require your personal data to be adequately safeguarded.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Philips will disclose personal data only in conformance with this Privacy Notice and/or when required by law.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">From time to time, Philips may sell a business or a part of a business to another company. Such a transfer of ownership could include the transfer of your personal data directly related to that business to the purchasing company.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Your rights</h3><p class="MsoNormal">Once you have provided us with your personal data, you have reasonable access to that information so that you can update, modify or, if legally possible, delete it. For My Philips you may do this by logging into your account and accessing your "personal settings", where you can also change your preferences relating to how Philips communicates with you. You may also make these requests regarding your personal data by contacting Philips at <a href="mailto:privacy@philips.com">privacy@philips.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">You will also be provided with an opt-out opportunity when necessary and we will comply with any local legislation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">We encourage you to keep your personal settings and personal data complete and current.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Your choices</h3><p class="MsoNormal">We want to know you better so we can serve you better while at the same time respecting your choices about how we use your personal data.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Your personal data may be transferred from your home country to other Philips companies, in different locations around the world, which may communicate with you about Philips products, services or special offers that you may be interested in. If local law requires it, we will ask for prior consent to transfer your personal data outside of your geographic region.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">If you do not want us to send you personalised offers or information, you can let us know by checking the appropriate box on the registration form or reply card, or by selecting "opt-out" on emails you receive.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Where local law requires it, we will ask you to "opt-in" or affirmatively consent to the processing of your personal data. For example, where local law so requires, we will only send you newsletters if you have subscribed to them. Similarly, where local law so requires, we will ask you to "opt-in" before using sophisticated profiling techniques.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p>Because Philips sells thousands of products in hundreds of countries, you may have previously provided us with your personal data through reply cards, via our call centres or in some other manner. Your decision not to register now will not affect the personal data you have already provided to Philips. Of course, you will always have the option to unsubscribe from any targeted communication from Philips or change your personal profile information.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Do Not Track Signals</h3><p class="MsoNormal">Philips takes privacy and security very seriously, and strives to put our website users first in all aspects of our business.

These websites may operate independently from Philips, and may have their own privacy notices, statements or policies.

This means that your personal data may be processed on behalf of Philips by a cloud service provider and could be stored in different locations around the world.

Philips uses a variety of security technologies and organisational procedures to help protect your personal data. For example, we implement access controls, use firewalls, secure servers and we encrypt certain types of data, such as financial information and other sensitive data.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Special information for parents</h3><p class="MsoNormal">While Philips websites are not generally targeted at children under the age of 16, it is Philips' policy to comply with the law when it requires parent or guardian permission before children's information is collected, used or disclosed.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Philips strongly recommends that parents take an active role in supervising the online activities of their children. If you believe we have collected personal data from a person who is under the age of 16, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@philips.com">privacy@philips.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Changes to this Privacy Notice</h3><p class="MsoNormal">The services that Philips provides are always evolving and the form and nature of the services that Philips provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.
