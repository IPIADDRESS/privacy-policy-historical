            <p><b>Philips Privacy Policy for the Internet</b></p>
            <p>Philips believes strongly in protecting the privacy of the personally 
              identifiable information you share with us, and respecting the permission 
              you give us to use that information. (Personally identifiable information 
              is information that can identify you by, for example, your name, 
              address, telephone number or e-mail address.) We also believe it 
              is important to disclose how we will use your information, and to 
              give you choices about how it will be used. </p>
            <p><b><br>
              Why should you share information with Philips?</b></p>
            <p>Sharing your personally identifiable information enables us to 
              offer you a number of benefits. This will make it easier and more 
              convenient for you to: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Buy Philips products online </li>
              <li>Register your purchase so you can receive all the benefits to 
                which your purchase entitles you </li>
              <li>Request information specific to your interests </li>
              <li>Participate in online communities </li>
              <li>Receive personalized messages and special offers that are relevant 
                to your interests </li>
              <li>Save time by storing your preferences </li>
              <li>It will also allow us to conduct market research to help us 
                develop better products, to provide more responsive customer service 
                and to improve our web sites. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may choose to share your information with us by completing 
              an online registration form to enter a contest, register a purchase, 
              participate in a promotion, subscribe to a newsletter or communicate 
              with a customer care representative. Registration of your personal 
              information always involves filling in a form. </p>
            <p><b><br>
              Your choices</b></p>
            <p>We want to know you better so we can serve you better. But the 
              choice of whether you want this kind of service is up to you. We 
              do not require visitors to Philips web sites to share personally 
              identifiable information. </p>
            <p>We will only collect, use or share your personally identifiable 
              information if you give us explicit permission to do so. By completing 
              any online registration form (and checking/ticking the opt-in box 
              where required by law), you are giving us permission to use and 
              share your information under the rules set out below.</p>
            <p>Because Philips sells thousands of products in hundreds of countries, 
              you may have previously provided us with personally identifiable 
              information through the warranty registration cards, our call centres, 
              or in some other manner. Your decision not to register now will 
              not cancel contacts that occur as a result of your previous interactions 
              with Philips. </p>
            <p><br>
              <b> Sharing information</b></p>
            <p>You should know that by registering you are giving Philips permission 
              to transfer your personally identifiable information from your home 
              country to other Philips divisions, or selected companies around 
              the world, who may communicate with you about products or special 
              offers you may find useful. Some of these partner companies may 
              repackage the information and use it under rules and conditions 
              specified by Philips. </p>
            <p>Philips will not share any personal financial information you provide 
              (such as credit card information) with other companies. From time 
              to time, this website may provide links to other websites. You should 
              carefully review the privacy policies on those sites; they may differ 
              from the Philips Privacy Policy. </p>
            <p><br>
              <b> Cookies</b></p>
            <p>Some of our web sites will send a "cookie," a small summary 
              file, to your computer. This allows us to recognize your computer 
              the next time you visit, without bothering you with another request 
              to register. Philips cookies do not collect personally identifiable 
              information. If you do not wish to receive cookies please refer 
              to your Internet Browser to learn how to block all cookies, or receive 
              a warning before a cookie is stored. To learn more about cookies 
              we encourage you to visit <br>

              <b>Safeguarding the information you share with us</b></p>
            <p>We recognize our responsibility to protect the information you 
              entrust to us. Philips uses a variety of secure techniques to protect 
              your information, including secure servers, firewalls and encryption 
              of financial data. </p>
            <p>Philips web sites also may make chat rooms, forums, message boards 
              and/or newsgroups available to you. Please remember that any personally 
              identifiable information that you provide in these areas becomes 
              public information, and you should exercise caution in deciding 
              to disclose it. It is important to note that Philips will release 
              personally identifiable information if compelled by law. </p>
            <p><br>
              <b> Special information for children and parents</b></p>
            <p>While Philips web sites are generally not targeted to children 
              under the age of thirteen, it is Philips policy to comply with the 
              law when it requires that a parent's or guardian's permission is 
              secured before knowingly collecting, using or disclosing personal 
              information of children under the age of 13. </p>
            <p>We strongly recommend that parents take an active role in supervising 
              the online activity of their children. For more information we recommend 
              that you visit the following web site: Kidz Privacy Campaign of 
              the Federal Trade Commission at: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy" target="_blank">www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy</a></p>
