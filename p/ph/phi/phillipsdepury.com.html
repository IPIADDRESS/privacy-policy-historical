				            </li>
				        </ol>
				    </li>
				    <h3>To whom we may pass your Personal Data?</h3>
				    <li>
						<span>We may transfer your Personal Data externally:</span>
				        <ol>
				            <li>
				                <span>to professional advisors, third party suppliers or subcontractors who perform our contract obligations or who assist us in conducting our business such as data hosting, call centre operations, credit agencies, e-mail management services analytics or other services in relation to our website or Services; and</span>
				            </li>
				            <li>
				                <span>when we believe it is necessary to comply with the law; or we need to do this in connection with protecting our business or enforcing our legal rights, or we need to protect another person's rights, property, or safety or we need to act against actual or suspected illegal activity and reduce unwarranted risk to our business.  This includes, but is not limited to, exchanging information with third parties such as the police, law enforcement agencies, the courts, fraud prevention agencies, debt collection agencies and regulatory authorities.</span>
				            </li>
				        </ol>
				    </li>
				    <li>
				        <span>Unless you are located in Hong Kong, we may (with your permission) use and share your Personal Data with other companies in the Phillips Group and carefully selected third parties to send you promotional information which you may find interesting.  If you are located in Hong Kong, we may (with your permission) only transfer your name, address, email address, telephone and/or fax number within the Phillips Group such that any company in the Phillips Group can send you promotional information about auction, private sale, valuation, financing and other services which they provide.</span>
				    </li>
				    <li>
				        <span>We may transfer your Personal Data (as part of a transfer of our customer, supplier or marketing database) to a third party acquirer or investor where there is a reorganisation or sale of all or part of our business. In such a case we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the security of your Personal Data continues to be respected in line with this Privacy Policy.</span>
				    </li>
				    <li>
				        <span>All use of your Personal Data will be subject to us observing applicable legal obligations and your legal rights (see the ‘Your Legal Rights’ section below).</span>
				    </li>
				    <h3>Consent to worldwide transfer and processing of Personal Data</h3>
				    <li>
				        <span>Phillips operates globally, and has worldwide affiliates. When you give us your Personal Data, it may be processed by us in all countries in which we do business. Each of these countries has different privacy laws that afford varying levels of protection. Some of these countries may not offer the same legal protection to personal data as member states of the European Union.  Phillips will treat the privacy of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy even if local laws afford your Personal Data a lesser degree of protection. By providing your Personal Data to Phillips, you consent to Phillips’ transmission to, and processing of, your Personal Data in any jurisdiction.</span>
				    </li>
				    <h3>Security</h3>
				    <li>
				        <span>We are committed to ensuring that any Personal Data we hold about you is properly safeguarded. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect your Personal Data against unauthorised access or disclosure and any loss, destruction or damage.</span>
				    </li>
				    <li>
				        <span>We endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect your Personal Data from external threats, however, please be aware that there are inherent security risks of sending information by public networks or on public computers and we cannot therefore guarantee the security of any data disclosed or transmitted over the internet.</span>
				    </li>
				    <li>
				        <span>Where you sign-up to participate in auctions or receive other Services, you may be provided with log-in information and may have the ability to set passwords to allow you to access a personal account page. Where we do so, it is on the condition that you will be responsible for ensuring that such log-in information and any passwords are kept secure and confidential at all times.  You will not share any log-in information or passwords, without our express authorisation.  We cannot be responsible for any loss or damage caused by your negligence, misuse of log-in details or your decision to share account access with others.</span>
				    </li>
				    <h3>Phishing</h3>
				    <li>
				        <span>Sometimes unauthorised individuals send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information, using the information (such as the email and domain names of) a legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such information is sought for identity theft. This illegal activity has come to be known as "phishing." </span>
				    </li>
				    <li>
				        <span>If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information via e-mail or to a website that seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to us.</span>
				    </li>
