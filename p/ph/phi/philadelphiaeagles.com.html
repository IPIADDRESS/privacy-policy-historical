<p align="center"><strong>Web Site Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last Updated: December 8, 2011</p>
<p>This is the Privacy Policy for PhiladelphiaEagles.com and LincolnFinancialField.com, as well as Philadelphia Eagles’ various social networking profiles, operated by Philadelphia Eagles LLC (collectively, the "Website").&nbsp; (However, this Privacy Policy does not apply to PhiladelphiaEagles.com/Kids, which has its own posted privacy policy.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know your privacy is important to you, and we want you to know that it is important to us, too.&nbsp; This Policy describes the kinds of information we may collect, how we may collect it, with whom we may share it, and the choices you have regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of this information.&nbsp; By visiting our Website, you agree to the terms of this Policy as they may be amended from time to time.</p>
<p>Here are a few general principles to keep in mind as you read through this Policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>This Policy may change as our business evolves, so check back to this page periodically to make sure you understand how your information will be treated.</li>
<li>This Policy is incorporated into, and part of, our <a mce_href="http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/footer/terms-and-conditions.html" href="http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/footer/terms-and-conditions.html">Terms of Use</a>, which govern your use of the Website as a whole.</li>
<li>This Policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain, other than through our Website, such as at our stadiums and live events.</li>
<li>This Website complies with EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.</li>
<li><b>With your consent on a one-time basis, we may share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes.&nbsp; </b></li>
<li><b>If you are located outside of the United States, you should know that the information you provide to us is being transmitted to us and processed in the United States and will be protected subject to this privacy policy and United States laws, which may not be as protective as the laws in your country.&nbsp; Also, this Site places cookies on your computer or device which are further described below.&nbsp; By using the Site, you agree to this.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>We are a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program, which covers our PhiladelphiaEagles.com and LincolnFinancialField.com sites but not our social networking profiles or downloadable applications.&nbsp; TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.&nbsp; In addition to helping us with this Policy, TRUSTe is there to help you obtain answers to your questions or concerns about this Policy or our privacy practices.&nbsp; If you attempt to contact us at webteam@philadelphiaeagles.com, and we do not acknowledge your inquiry or satisfactorily address your concerns, you should contact TRUSTe at http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php.&nbsp; TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison to resolve your concerns.</p>

<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Questions about this Policy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information We Collect on the Website</h1>
<p><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">User Provided Information</span></i></p>
<p>“Personal Information” is information that can be used to identify you as an individual or allow someone to contact you.&nbsp; When other information, such as a favorite team or player, is associated with personal information, it also becomes personally identifiable information for purposes of this Policy.&nbsp; We collect Personal Information such as your full name, telephone number, street address, email address, unique identifiers (like your Message Board User ID and password), demographic information (like your date of birth, age, gender, ticket holder status, game attendance, marital status, or number of children), and financial information (like your credit or debit card number) in various ways and for various reasons.&nbsp; For example, we collect Personal Information when you sign up for our newsletters, register for an account on our Website, create account recovery credentials, register to play games on the Website, make online purchases, enter sweepstakes and contests, complete surveys or voting polls, contribute to a social forum on the Website, or submit a comment or question to us using a “contact us” or similar feature on the Website.</p>
<p>The “Tell-A-Friend” tool provided on the Website and/or in our e-mails allows you to send information about us to your friends and family members.&nbsp; When you use this tool, we will ask you for your friend's or family member’s name and email address.&nbsp; We will then use this information to automatically send your friend or family member an email inviting him or her to visit the Website.</p>
<p><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Website Usage Information</span></i></p>
<p>As is the case with many Web sites, our servers automatically collect your IP address when you visit the Website.&nbsp; We may also capture certain “clickstream data” pertaining to your Website usage.&nbsp; Clickstream data includes, for example, information about your Web browser and operating system and their settings, the referring page that linked you to the Website, the pages or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, the next Web site you visit when you leave the Website, and any search terms you have entered on the Website or a referral site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, we and our third party partners may deploy various tracking technologies on the Website to collect additional information about your Website visits.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies are small data files stored on your computer or device at the request of a Web site.&nbsp; A cookie may enable us to relate your use of the Website to other information about you.&nbsp; Cookies may also be used to enhance your experience on the Website (for example, by storing your MemberID and/or password for the online store) or to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information.&nbsp; Most browsers can be set to detect cookies and give you an opportunity to reject them, but refusing cookies may, in some cases, inhibit or preclude your use of the Website or its features.&nbsp; To learn more about the use of cookies, including how to manage or delete them, click here.</li>
<li>HTML5 (the language some Web sites are coded in) may be used to store information on your computer or device about your site usage activities.&nbsp; This information can be retrieved by us to determine how our Website is being used by our visitors, how it can be improved, and to customize it for our users.</li>
<li>A pixel tag (also known as a “clear GIF” or “web beacon”) is a tiny image – typically just one-pixel – that can be placed on a Web page or in our electronic communications to you in order to help us measure the effectiveness of our content by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit us online or verifying whether you’ve opened one of our emails or seen one of our Web pages.</li>
<li>Email Communications: When you open emails from us, we may receive a confirmation noting you opened the email, if your computer supports such capabilities. We also may keep track of what emails we send you and what emails you may be receiving from our subsidiaries and affiliates. Additionally, we keep a record of what communications you have opted to receive or not to receive.</li>
</ul>
<p>These tracking technologies may be deployed by us and/or by our partners on our behalf. These technologies may enable us to relate your Website Usage Information to other information about you, including your Personal Information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>By using our Website, you agree to our use of tracking technologies through our Website.</b></p>
<p><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Social Networking</span></i></p>
<p>We maintain presence on several social networking platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and we also incorporate some of their features onto our Website, such as Facebook’s “Like It”.&nbsp; Through these platforms and features, we receive some Personal Information and some usage information about you, and this Privacy Policy applies to that information as well.&nbsp; In addition, third party social networking platforms have their own privacy policies which explain how the third parties that provide them will use and protect your information.</p>
<p><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Obtained from Third Parties</span></i></p>
<p>We may supplement the Personal Information we collect from you with information that we obtain from third parties, such as our partners in sponsored content sections, our affiliates with whom you have previously done business, and data aggregators.&nbsp; The information we obtain from third parties may include, but is not limited to, things like your contact information, preferences, and demographic information.</p>
<h1>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How We Use the Information We Collect</h1>
<p>As applicable, we or one of our trusted partners may use the information we collect from and about you to:</p>

<p>To perform the above functions, we may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Website Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources (including third parties) such as demographic information and updated contact information.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Sharing of Your Information</h1>
<p>We may share your personal information with others for various purposes. In addition to the kinds of information sharing you might expect, such as sharing with third parties who need your information in order to provide services to us (or on our behalf) and sharing what you voluntarily post to public areas on the Website with other Website users, we may share your information:</p>
<ul>
<li>with the public if you win a contest or sweepstakes, but subject to the terms and conditions of such contest or sweepstakes, and not without your consent unless the law requires us to;</li>
<li>subject to your consent on a one-time basis, with third parties for their own marketing purposes;</li>
<li>subject to your consent, with our sponsor(s) if we obtain your information in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or other promotional activity that is offered by a third party or jointly offered by us and any third parties;</li>
<li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or property, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a government, judicial or other legal request; and</li>
<li>in connection with a corporate change including a merger, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, bankruptcy or sale of assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we may share Website Usage Information and other non-personally identifiable information about our users and user behavior with our marketing partners, affiliates, and other third parties.</p>

<p>Please understand the following with respect to your request to opt out of having your information shared or receiving further promotional communications:</p>
<ul>
<li>it may take us a few days to process your request</li>
<li>to stop receiving communications from a third party with whom we have already shared your Personal Information, you must contact that third party directly</li>
<li>even if you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with us.</li>
</ul>
<h1>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Links to Other Websites</h1>
<p>You should be aware that when you are on the Website you could be directed to other Web sites that are beyond our control, including through links from advertisers, sponsors and marketing partners that may use the Website's logo as part of a co-branding agreement.&nbsp; For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, your click may take you to a third party’s Web site.&nbsp; These other Websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.&nbsp; If you visit a Web site that is linked to our Website, you should become comfortable with that Web site's privacy policies and practices before providing any Personal Information.</p>
<h1>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Security</h1>
<p>This Website incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the Personal Information that we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions to protect such information from loss, misuse and alteration.&nbsp; Your sensitive personally identifiable information is transferred to our computers utilizing encryption software.&nbsp; However, do not send us sensitive Personal Information by email or a “contact us” feature on our Website since these transmissions may not be secure.&nbsp; Only those employees who need access to your sensitive information in order to do their jobs are allowed access.&nbsp; Our security policies are reviewed periodically and revised as required.</p>
<p>If we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our care may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development.&nbsp; If a notification is appropriate, we will endeavor to notify you as promptly as possible under the circumstances.&nbsp; If we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.&nbsp; <b>You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.</b>&nbsp; <b>If you prefer for us to use the U.S. Postal Service to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at</b><b> webteam@philadelphiaeagles.com</b>.<b>.</b></p>

<h5>How Information May Be Collected</h5>
<p>We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Website, including but not limited to those described below:</p>
<p>Registration: You may be asked to complete a registration form and provide personally identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Website may choose to offer, such as newsletters or contests. Participation in registration is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.</p>
<p>Newsletters and Website Emails: We offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Website, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our marketing partners and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Website. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website. You may also cancel your free email subscription by following the instructions provided on the Website or in the newsletter or email. You may also cancel your free email subscription by sending an email to: <a href="mailto: webteam@philadelphiaeagles.com">webteam@philadelphiaeagles.com</a>.</p>
<p>Contests or Sweepstakes: We periodically operate contests and sweepstakes through the Website that may require registration or the submission of personal information. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website. Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes, (see the rules of each contest for details about how your personal information will be used). We may also ask your permission to allow us to publicly post some of your information on the Website, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Except as required by applicable law, we will not post your information without your permission. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Website, and collect your information. In those cases, where we are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we do not collect your information and we have no control over the information collected from you. Accordingly, we urge you to review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.</p>
<p>Surveys or Voting: From time-to-time we may request personally identifiable information from you in conjunction with a survey or voting poll. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.</p>
<p>Games: When you register to play games on our Website, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Cookies: As with many Websites, our Website uses a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a unique, random number that is stored in the browser on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify you, just the computer that is used to visit the site. Cookies automatically identify your browser to the Website whenever your computer is used to visit the Website. Cookies also let us know how many people visit our website and where visitors go on the site. In addition, cookies can let us know non-personally identifiable information, like what web browser is being used to access the website. For registered users, cookies can make using the Website easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Website, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Website are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Website. Cookies may also allow the Website to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. When using the Philadelphia Eagles online store, your MemberID will be stored in the season or in a 'cookie' when 'Remember Me' is checked. OrderId is stored in the cookie/session, however the billing, shipping information and gift card are cleared from the order when the browser is closed. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, your browser should contain an option that allows you to disable or delete cookie data at any time. Some areas of the Website, however, may not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. Cookies are not tied to personal information.</p>
<p>Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technology: Our Website uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites. We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Web sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Web sites. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.</p>
<p>IP Addresses and Click-Stream Data: We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data. An IP address is a number associated with the service through which you access the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors, for example regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information. Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Website. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Website, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.</p>
<p>Transaction Information: If you conduct a financial transaction with our Website, such as buy our products, register for an Eagles event or subscribe to services offered on our "Website", we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including contact information, demographic information and financial information. We will use this information to complete the transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, products or other services that you order, and to invoice you. For your protection, such information is collected and stored through encrypted means.</p>
<p><a name="3"></a></p>
<h5>How We Use The Information Collected</h5>
<p>As applicable, the information you provide to us may be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li value="0">contact you about the Website;</li>
<li value="0">contact you relating to your membership status;</li>
<li value="0">confirm or fulfill an order you have made;</li>
<li value="0">inform you of a prize you have won;</li>
<li value="0">monitor or improve the use of the Website;</li>

</ul>
<p><a name="4"></a></p>
<h5>With Whom The Information May Be Shared</h5>
<p>At times, we may share your personal information with others for various purposes. The following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others and the ways in which you may opt-out of having your information shared:</p>
<p>Agents: We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, Website analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for their own purposes, like sending you marketing offers about their products. Aggregate Information: We may share aggregate information, such as demographics and Website usage statistics, with advertisers, sponsors or other organizations. When this type of information is shared, the other parties do not have access to your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Other Promotional Offers: We may send offers to you on behalf of our marketing partners. When we do this, we do not give that partner your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, you may use the opt-out method detailed in the email or change your preferences by logging into your account.</p>
<p>Third-Party Ad Serving &amp; Audience and Traffic Measurement Services: The Website may use a third party network advertiser to serve the advertisements on the Website or may use a traffic measurement service to analyze the traffic on the Website. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to this Website and other Websites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products or Websites you might be interested in. Audience and Traffic Measurement Services allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behavior information from our Website by monitoring anonymous visitor activity. Although advertisers or other companies do not have access to the Website cookies, the Website's advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have your cookies enabled in your browser. Cookies allow third party advertisers to show you advertisements or content you might be interested in. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.</p>
<p>Business Transfers: In the event that all or substantially all of our assets are sold or transferred to another party, or another transaction occurs in which your personally identifiable information is one of the business assets transferred, all personally identifiable information that has been collected and saved may be one of the business assets we transfer. See "Your Acceptance of the Privacy Policy and Notification of Changes to the Policy" section below.</p>
<p>Administrative or Legal Process: Your personal information may be transferred to third parties without notice to you in order to comply with applicable law, law enforcement agencies, to protect our rights, or protect the rights of other users of this website.</p>
<p><a name="5"></a></p>
<h5>Chat Rooms, Forums, And Discussion Boards</h5>
<p>The Website may make chat rooms, forums, fan directories and discussion boards available to its users. You are not required to provide any personal information when using these areas but you may choose to do so. If you post personal information online, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. We cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public in a chat room, forum, or discussion board. Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas.</p>
<p><a name="6"></a></p>
<h5>Links To Other Websites</h5>
<p>You should be aware that when you are on the Website you could be directed to other Websites beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Website onto a different Website. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and marketing partners that may use the Website's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a Website that is linked to our Website, you should consult that Website's privacy policy before providing any personal information.</p>
<p><a name="7"></a></p>
<h5>Security</h5>
<p>This Website incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the personal information that we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions to protect such information from loss, misuse and alteration. Your personally identifiable information is transferred to our computers utilizing encryption software. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access. Our security policies are reviewed periodically and revised as required.</p>

<h5>A Special Note For Parents Concerning Privacy</h5>

If in the future, we collect personally identifiable information from children, it will do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) including, without limitation, obtaining necessary parental consent. For more information about the privacy practices for our affiliated children's Website, such as "PhiladelphiaEagles.com/Kids", please consult the <a href="/kids/KidsClubPrivacyPolicy.asp">children's privacy policy</a> at the children's Website.</p>
<p>The Internet offers children wonderful educational and entertainment resources. Your guidance and involvement are essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience.

<h5>Your Acceptance Of The Privacy Policy And Notification Of Changes To The Policy</h5>
<p>By using this Website, you signify your agreement to the terms of our privacy policy. We may amend this privacy policy at any time. If we make a material change to the way in which we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will post a notice on our website and / or send an email to users who have provided an email address. We will assume that you have given your permission for your information to be used under the terms of the new privacy policy, if you do not respond to our email within thirty days or continue to use the Website thirty days after a notice is posted. Please note that you should always update your personal information to provide us with a current email address.</p>
<p><a name="10"></a></p>
<h5>Correcting/Updating Personal Information</h5>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your email address or zip code), or if you no longer desire to access our Website, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you have provided to us.

<h5>Your California Privacy Rights</h5>
<p>A California privacy law that went into effect on January 1, 2005, allows California residents to obtain specific information about a business's privacy practices if it shares information with other companies for those companies' direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p>As explained in this privacy policy, whenever you agree to let us collect personal information about you, we will always provide you with an option to prevent this information from being shared for non-administrative purposes with third parties. You can exercise this option at any time by following the steps outlined above.</p>
<p>Because this website has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with details on how you may opt-in / opt-out of the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes, we are not required to provide you with this information.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident and have questions about our compliance with this law, please send an email to <a href="mailto: webteam@philadelphiaeagles.com">webteam@philadelphiaeagles.com</a> or write to us at CA Privacy Rights, Philadelphia Eagles, NovaCare Complex, One NovaCare Way, Philadelphia, PA 19145 Attn: Internet.<br /><br /><a name="12"></a></p>
