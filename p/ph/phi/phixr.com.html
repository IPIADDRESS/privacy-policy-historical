</ul>

<p><span class="heading0">Privacy Policy</span></p>

<p>This privacy policy describes how we treat personal information of our users.</p>

<p>What This Privacy Policy Covers</p>

<ul class="ab">
<li>This privacy policy pertains to the use of the Site at http://www.phixr.com/ and related or
affiliate sites in different languages.</li>
<li>This privacy policy covers how we treat personal information that we eventually collect and receive.
Personal information - in general - is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name,
email address, or phone number if applicable.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="heading2">General Information</span></p>

<ul class="ab">
<li>We collect some personal information when you register with the Site. At the moment,
the only personal data collected is your freely chosen user name (which, of course, doesn't have
to be your real name).</li>
<li>Beside that, the Site automatically receives and records information on our server logs
from your browser, including your IP address, cookies, and the page you request.</li>
<li>We use this information for the following general purposes: product and
service provision, identification and authentication, service improvement, research, and
anonymous reporting.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="heading2">IP Addresses</span></p>

<p>IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web
page. Your IP address is stored in our user registration databases when you
register.</p>

<p>IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including:</p>

<ul class="ab">
<li>To diagnose or service technology problems reported by our users or
engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web
company or ISP.</li>
<li>To tailor advertising based on geographic area or other information
derived from your IP address.</li>
<li>To estimate the total number of users visiting the Site from specific
geographical regions.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="heading2">Cookies</span></p>

<p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique
identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored
on your computer's hard drive.</p>

<ul class="ab">
<li>You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies,
or notify you when a cookie is set.</li>
<li>If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use the Site.</li>
<li>The Site uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to
	<ul>
	<li>access your information when you sign in (regardless whether for a temporary
	    session as a guest or by using your registered account details),</li>
	<li>keep track of preferences you specify while you are using the Site's
		services,</li>

		interests and activity on the Site,</li>
	<li>estimate and report our total audience size and traffic,</li>
	<li>conduct research to improve the Site's content and services.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>The Site lets other companies [that show advertisements on some of our pages,
or perform user counting, eg. Google] set and access their cookies on your computer.
Other entities' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.
Advertisers or other entities do not have access to the Site's own cookies.</li>
<li>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.
('Google'). Google Analytics uses 'cookies', which are text files placed on your computer,
to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie
about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored
by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose
of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website
operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.
Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law,
or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. <i>Google will not
associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.</i> You may refuse the use of
cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that
if you do this you will not be able to use this website. By accepting these terms and
conditions, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and
for the purposes set out above. <i>This website runs Google Analytics with the
extension "_anonymizeIp ()" to truncate IP addresses in order to avoid a direct link
to individuals and provide full anonymity. If your browser sends a "Do not track"-header,
tracking is disabled.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Even more information on cookies is <a href="/about/cookiepolicy">here</a>.

<a name="fbperms"></a>
</p><p><span class="heading2">Facebook permissions</span></p>

<p>For Phixr to provide all its Facebook-related services, it needs certain permissions to access your Facebook data.
Here is which permissions are needed and what Phixr uses them for:</p>

<ul class="ab">
<li><b>"Your basic info"</b>: Phixr only uses <i>your name</i> for tagging yourself in a photo,
and the <i>list of your friends</i> for tagging them and accessing their photos. No other information
is accessed or used.</li>
<li><b>"Your Photos" and "Photos shared with you"</b>: This is for allowing Phixr to <i>download
your photos</i> from Facebook, including photo tags.</li>
<li><b>"Post on your behalf"</b>: As dangerous as this might sound, in fact, this is only needed to
<i>upload photos</i> to your albums. Phixr does not "post" anything to your wall. As of August 2013,
this permission is not asked for upon entering Phixr, only later if you want to upload a photo.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can revoke all permissions from within the "Privacy" page in your Facebook account settings. If you remove
Phixr as a Facebook app, permissions are revoked and Facebook notifies Phixr; in that case Phixr will permanently
delete all your Facebook related data.</p>

<p><span class="heading1">Information Sharing and Disclosure</span></p>

<ul class="ab">
<li>When you e-mail a photo, your Site user name that you are registered under
is visible to the recipient(s) of the e-mail. So is the e-mail address you
specified in your profile.</li>
<li>We do not rent or sell or share any personal information.</li>
<li>It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent,
or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including
without limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the
physical safety of any person, violations of the Site's Terms of Use, or as
otherwise permitted or required by law. We will transfer information about you if
the Site or our company is acquired by or merged with another company. In this
event, we will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Site
before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different
privacy policy. We may share demographic information with business partners,
such as "12% of users who regularly use the Site are from countries that start
with 'A'" or the like. No personally identifiable information will ever be used
without your permission.</li>
<li>The Site displays targeted advertisements based on personal information.</li>
<li>All personal information and other data will be stored and processed in the
United States and this information may be subject to the laws of this jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="heading1">Editing Account Information. Security.</span></p>

<ul class="ab">
<li>You can change your Account Information, at any time.</li>
<li>We may send you certain communications relating to the Site's service, such
as service announcements and administrative messages, that are considered part
of your account.</li>
<li>We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we
believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide
products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</li>
<li>Your Account Information is password-protected.</li>
<li>In certain areas, the Site may use SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="heading1">Changes to this Privacy Policy</span></p>

<p>We may update this policy at any time for any reason. If there are any
significant changes to how we handle personal information we will send a notice
to the email address specified in your account or by placing a prominent
notice on our site.</p>
