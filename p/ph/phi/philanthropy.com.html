<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p><i>The Chronicle</i> is committed to protecting the privacy of its subscribers and other users of its online services. The following policies apply to philanthropy.com and any other <i>Chronicle of Philanthropy</i> Web sites.</p>

<p>Our Web site may contain links to other Web sites for your convenience and information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information.</p>

<p><i><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b></i></p>

<p><b>Registration for our Web sites</b></p>

<p>Anyone can view our site, but free registration and/or subscription is required for access to the full range of information and services.</p>

<p>Philanthropy.com requires that you supply an e-mail address to register. You will also be asked for demographic information, which is optional. By using Philanthropy.com, you are agreeing to the terms of our <a href="/help/useragreement.htm">User Agreement.</a></p>

<p>Subscribing to <i>The Chronicle</i> requires that you supply your name, postal address, e-mail address, and credit-card number or other billing information to process your subscription request, as well as to manage your online account.</p>

<p><b>Paid products and services</b></p>

<p>While much of our Web site is free, we do charge fees for select premium content, products, and services. To enable the purchase of these products, we collect and store billing and encrypted credit-card information. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit-card payments.</p>

<p><b>Contests and special offers</b></p>

<p>On occasion, <i>The Chronicle</i> collects personal information from readers in connection with optional contests or special offers. If this information is to be shared with a third party other than <i>The Chronicle,</i> we will notify you at the time of collection. If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the contest or special offer.</p>

<p><b>Reader surveys and market research</b></p>

<p><i>The Chronicle</i> may collect personal information from readers in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected on our Web site, on a survey company's Web site, on the phone, or through the mail. The information you provide in answer to optional survey questions may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.</p>

<p><i><b>Aggregate Information Collected Through Technology</b></i></p>

<p><b>Cookies and other technologies</b></p>

<p>As is standard practice on many Web sites, <i>The Chronicle</i> uses “cookies” and other technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand which parts of our Web site are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. Users who do not accept cookies from the domain “philanthropy.com” cannot access most areas of our site.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to place a cookie on your computer with a unique, anonymous number to ensure that your browser does not see the same advertisement repeatedly, to sequence ads in a series, and to measure the number of unique visitors who have visited a particular Web page or viewed a particular ad.</p>

<p>In addition, advertisers may elect to use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our Web site. In the course of serving these advertisements, the third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your computer. We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain. You may block cookies from loading. Blocking cookies may prevent our site from working properly on your browser.</p>

<p><b>IP addresses</b></p>

<p><i>The Chronicle</i> logs <span class="caps">IP</span> (Internet protocol) addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We use the <span class="caps">IP</span> address log in an aggregate fashion to track access to our site.</p>

<p><b>Log files</b></p>

<p>Log data is only used in aggregate to analyze usage of our Web site.</p>

<p><i><b>What Do We Do With the Information We Gather About You?</b></i></p>

<p><b>Statistical analysis</b></p>

<p><i>The Chronicle</i> may perform statistical, demographic, and marketing analyses of subscribers and their subscribing and purchasing patterns, for product development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our subscriber base. We also use such information to allow advertising to be targeted, in aggregate, to readers for whom such advertising is most pertinent.</p>

<p><b>Products and services from The Chronicle</b></p>

<p>From time to time, we may provide subscribers with information and offers about other products and services offered by <i>The Chronicle,</i> including subscriptions, products, and services.  If you do not wish to receive such information and offers, you may opt out by emailing <a href="mailto:optout@philanthropy.com">optout@philanthropy.com</a>.</p>

<p><b>Banner advertising</b></p>

<p>We may use demographic and preference information to allow advertising on our Web sites to be targeted, in aggregate, to the users for whom they are most pertinent. This means users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. We will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form.</p>

<p><b>User-generated content (comments, forums, and discussions)</b></p>

<p>We offer the ability to post content in a number of areas on our Web site. Any information you disclose when posting on our site, along with your user name, becomes public and may be used by <i>The Chronicle</i> for online and off-line promotional or commercial uses in any and all media.

We provide these companies only with the information they need to perform their services. These service providers are restricted from using this data in any way other than to provide services for <i>The Chronicle,</i> and they may not share or resell this data.</p>
