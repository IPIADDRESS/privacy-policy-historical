<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p><i>The Chronicle</i> is committed to protecting the privacy of its subscribers and other users of its online services. The following policies apply to Philanthropy.com and any other <i>Chronicle of Philanthropy</i> Web sites.</p>

<p>Philanthropy.com may contain links to other Web sites for your convenience and information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any Web site before submitting your personal information.</p>


<p><i><b>Personally Identifiable Information Collected by The Chronicle</b></i></p>

<p><b>Account creation</b></p>

<p>Anyone can view our Web site, but a free account and/or subscription is required for access to the full range of information and online services.</p>

<p><i>The Chronicle</i> requires that you provide an e-mail address in order to create an account. You will also be asked for demographic information related to your profession. By using Philanthropy.com, you are agreeing to the terms of our <a href="/help/useragreement.htm">User Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>Subscribing to <i>The Chronicle</i> requires that you provide your name, postal address, e-mail address, and credit-card number or other billing information to process your subscription request as well as to manage your online account.</p>

<p><b>Paid products and services</b></p>


<p>While much of our Web site and online services are free, we do charge fees for certain premium content, products, and services. To enable the purchase of these products, we collect and store billing and encrypted credit-card information. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling subscriptions, placing job advertisements, and processing credit-card payments.</p>


<p><b>Contests and special offers</b></p>

<p>On occasion, <i>The Chronicle</i> collects personal information from readers in connection with optional contests or special offers. If this information is to be shared with a third party other than <i>The Chronicle</i>, we will notify you at the time of collection. If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the contest or special offer.</p>


<p><b>Reader surveys and market research</b></p>

<p><i>The Chronicle</i> may collect personal information from readers in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected on our Web site, on a survey company's Web site, on the phone, or through the mail. The information you provide in answer to survey questions may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.  You have the right to decline to participate in any survey.</p>


<p><i><b>Aggregate Information Collected Through Technology</b></i></p>


<p><b>Cookies and other technologies</b></p>

<p>As is standard practice on many Web sites, <i>The Chronicle</i> uses "cookies" and other technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand which parts of our Web site are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. Users who do not accept cookies from the domain "Philanthropy.com" will not have access to most areas of our Web site.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to place a cookie on your computer with a unique, anonymous number to ensure that your browser does not see the same advertisement repeatedly, to present ads in a series or sequence, and to measure the number of unique visitors who have viewed a particular ad.  We use cookies to store visitors' preferences, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return, and to customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor has provided.</p>

<p>In addition, advertisers may elect to use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our Web site. In the course of delivering these advertisements, the third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer. We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain. You may block cookies from loading but doing so may prevent our site from working properly in your browser.</p>

<p><b>IP addresses</b></p>

<p><i>The Chronicle</i> logs IP (Internet protocol) addresses, the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We use the IP address log in an aggregate fashion to track access to our site.</p>

<p><b>Log files</b></p>

<p>Log data are used only in aggregate to analyze usage of our Web site.</p>

<p><b><i>What Do We Do With the Information We Gather About You?</i></b></p>

<p><b>Statistical analysis</b></p>

<p><i>The Chronicle</i> may perform statistical, demographic, and marketing analyses of account holders and their subscribing and purchasing patterns, for product-development purposes and to inform advertisers about the nature of our Web traffic. We also use such information to allow advertising to be targeted, in aggregate, to readers for whom such advertising is most pertinent.</p>

<p><b>Products and services from The Chronicle</b></p>

<p>From time to time, we may provide you with information and offers about products and services offered by <i>The Chronicle</i>, including subscriptions, books, reports, and other services. If you do not wish to receive such information and offers, you may opt out by writing to <a href="mailto:optout@philanthropy.com">optout@philanthropy.com</a>.</p>

<p><b>Banner advertising</b></p>

<p>We may use demographic and preference information to allow advertising on our Web sites to be targeted, in aggregate, to the users for whom they are most pertinent. This means that users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. We disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form.</p>

<p><b>User-generated content (comments, forums, and discussions)</b></p>

<p>We offer the ability to post content in a number of areas on our Web site. Any information you disclose when posting on our site, along with your user name, becomes public and may be used by <i>The Chronicle</i> for online and off-line promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. Any posting becomes public as soon as it is published online. For more information, please refer to the <a href="/help/useragreement.htm">User Agreement</a>.</p>

<p><b>Account and service-related e-mail:</b> <i>The Chronicle</i> reserves the right to send you e-mail about your account status.

If you have registered for online discussions or other services, you may receive e-mail specific to your participation in those activities.</p>


<p><b>E-mail newsletters:</b> The Chronicle offers several e-mail newsletters that you can sign up for once you have a Chronicle account. If you no longer wish to receive a specific newsletter, follow the "unsubscribe" instructions located near the bottom of each newsletter.

<p><b>Survey e-mail:</b> We may send you e-mail inviting you to participate in user surveys, asking for feedback about <i>The Chronicle</i> or Philanthropy.com and about existing or prospective products and services, as well as information to better understand our readers. Reader surveys help us to improve our Web site, and any information we obtain in such surveys will not be shared with third parties, except in aggregate form. </p>


<p>Occasionally, we may send you an e-mail message inviting you to participate in a third-party sponsored survey. We recommend that you review the third party's privacy policy if you have any questions about how your responses might be used. You may choose not to receive survey requests by writing to <a href="mailto:optout@philanthropy.com">optout@philanthropy.com</a> and stating so in the subject line of the e-mail.</p>


<p><b>Promotional e-mail:</b> <i>The Chronicle</i> may periodically send you e-mail messages about products and services that we think may be of interest to you. You can choose not to receive messages in the future by either following the "unsubscribe" instructions located near the bottom of each e-mail message, or e-mailing <a href="mailto:optout@philanthropy.com">optout@philanthropy.com</a>.</p>


<p><b>HTML e-mail:</b> We may include coding to determine whether or not readers have viewed these messages. This process does not leave any information on your computer, nor does it collect information from your computer. <i>The Chronicle</i> will share this data with others in aggregate only.</p>


<p><b>E-mail from you:</b> If you send us e-mail messages, you should be aware that information disclosed in those messages may not be secure or encrypted and thus may be available to others. We suggest that you exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal or confidential information in an e-mail message. We will use your e-mail address to respond directly to your questions or comments.</p>


<p><b>E-mail this article/ad/topic feature:</b> Philanthropy.com readers may use these features to send links to articles (or ads or forum topics). The e-mail address(es) that you provide to these service will only be used to send the requested material.</p>


<p><b><i>With Whom Do We Share the Information We Gather?</i></b></p>


<p>If you are a subscriber to <i>The Chronicle</i>, we may exchange or rent your name and postal address with other reputable companies that offer marketing information or products through direct mail. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please send an e-mail message to <a href="mailto:subscriptions@philanthropy.com">subscriptions@philanthropy.com</a>.

These service providers are restricted from using these data in any way other than to provide services for <i>The Chronicle</i>, and they may not share or resell this data.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to disclose your opt-out information to third parties so they can suppress your name from future solicitations, in accordance with applicable laws. We may occasionally release personal information as required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena.
