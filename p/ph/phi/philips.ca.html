Philips appreciates the interest you have shown in our company, products and services by visiting our websites, <a href="http://www.philips.com/">www.philips.com</a> or related communication channels, including, but not limited to, our social media pages and/or channels and blogs (together "Philips Pages"). This Privacy Notice applies to all the personal data Philips collects when you interact with Philips, such as when you visit our websites, when you use the products or services offered by Philips, when you purchase products of Philips, when you subscribe to newsletters, when you contact customer support etc.</p><br><p>This includes, without limitation, all online and offline collections of all types of personal data. However, some Philips Pages collections work with special kinds of data (for example, medical data), which require a somewhat different privacy notice. Whenever and wherever that is the case, Philips will make it clear that the privacy notice concerned is different from this general Privacy Notice.</p><br><h3> </h3><h3>Why we ask you to share your Personal Data</h3><p>We ask you to share your personal data with us for purposes including, but not limited to:</p><br><ul style="list-style-type: disc !important;margin-left:10px !important;">	<li>	<div>Buying Philips products online;</div>	</li>	<li>	<div>Activating or registering certain products or enhancing functionality;</div>	</li>	<li>	<div>Receiving information about Philips products and services;</div>	</li>	<li>	<div>Participating in Philips online communities, including our social media channels/pages and blogs;</div>	</li>	 <li>	 <div>Storing your preferences for future interactions and communications from Philips;</div>     </li>	  <li>    <div>Helping us to develop products and create campaigns that are designed around you, optimise customer services and continuously improve our websites;</div>  </li>	 <li>	 <div>Helping us to improve products and services, and allowing Philips to keep you informed of, or involve you in testing of, new products and services;</div>	   </li>		 <li>	  <div>Resolving consumer and/or product issues;</div>	  </li>	<li>	 <div>Receiving personalised messages, special offers and advertisements that are relevant to your personal interests, based on the information you have shared with us and on the information we have collected through cookies or similar techniques regarding your use of the Philips websites/social media/blogs. For more information on how we use cookies, <a href="#cookienotice" target="_self">click here</a> </div>   </li></ul><br><p>We generally process your personal data only for those purposes that we have communicated with you. If we use it for other (closely related) purposes, additional data protection measures will be implemented if required by law.</p> <br><h3>Type of Personal Data we may collect</h3><p>When you interact with Philips, for instance by registering at My Philips, purchasing a product or interacting with Philips via our Philips Pages (e.g. "like us on Facebook"), we may ask for or receive certain data, such as:</p><br> <ul style="list-style-type: disc !important;margin-left:10px !important;">    <li>Your name;</li>  <li>Your email address;</li>  <li>Your telephone number;</li>  <li>Your social media profile;</li>  <li>Your gender;</li>  <li>Your age;</li>  <li>Information about the products you've purchased;</li>  <li>Your usage of and activities on our Philips Pages;</li>   <li>Your interests; and</li>   <li>Other information related to your online behavior.</li>     </ul>  <br><p>Also, depending on the choices you have made regarding your settings on various social media sites, and your settings on our Philips Pages, certain personal data may be shared with Philips about your online activities and social media profiles (e.g. interests, marital status, gender, user name, photo, comments you have posted etc.).</p><br> <p>In addition, <a href="#cookienotice" target="_self">we may collect personal data via cookies or similar techniques</a>, including, but not limited to:</p><br> <ul style="list-style-type: disc !important;margin-left:10px !important;">     <li>Your IP address;</li>   <li>Your cookie ID;</li>   <li>Your web browser;</li>   <li>Your location;</li>   <li>The web pages you visit on our websites;</li>    <li>The advertisements you've viewed or clicked through;</li>    <li>Etc.</li>	  </ul><br><h3>Different ways we collect your Personal Data</h3><p>You can share your personal data with Philips in several ways, including, but not limited to:</p><br> <ul style="list-style-type: disc !important;margin-left:10px !important;"> <li>Registering as a member of My Philips;</li> <li>Registering a purchase;</li>  <li>Your communications with Philips. These can be product- or service-related, and may include the contents of your questions to us, or requests you addressed to us;</li> <li>Communicating with one of our Philips Customer Care representatives by email or phone or in writing;</li> <li>Ordering a product;</li> <li>Participating in a promotion, game or competition;</li> <li>Participating in a social media activity related to a Philips promotion (for example clicking "like" or "share");</li><li>Asking to receive messages on your mobile phone/device;</li> <li>Subscribing to a Philips newsletter;</li> <li>Sending us a completed reply card, included with your Philips product;</li> <li>Voluntarily participating in product testing or surveys;</li> <li>Social sign-on (using your Facebook or LinkedIn credentials, for example, to create an account or log on);</li> <li>When using Philips connected products and/or Apps, you may be asked whether you wish to share data with Philips (e.g. share your usage data or your location data);</li><li><a href="#cookienotice" target="_self">Cookies</a> placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit our websites;</li><li>Social Listening: Philips may search the Internet for relevant and publicly available content and use it to improve its products or services, resolve consumer issues and provide targeted marketing.</li> </ul><br><p>Philips may also obtain your personal data if you are a customer of a Philips partner. Personal data may also reach us when we purchase another company of which you are a customer. If you do not want Philips to use your personal data that has not been provided by you, you may let us know at any time by contacting us at<a href="mailto:privacy@philips.com">privacy@philips.com</a>.</p><br><h3>Sharing your Personal Data with others</h3><p>We may share your personal data with service providers, business partners and other third parties, in accordance with applicable law.</p><br><p>For example, Philips may sell you a product or offer you a service in a joint marketing effort with another company (Business Partner). We will let you know that such a relationship exists and who these companies are prior to processing your data for such joint marketing efforts.</p><br><p>If we are required by law to obtain your consent, or otherwise believe that your consent is appropriate in the circumstances, we will obtain your consent before we share your personal data.</p><br><p>The agreements with these Business Partners will limit the purposes for which your personal data can be used and disclosed, and will require your personal data to be adequately safeguarded.</p><br><p>Philips will disclose personal data only in conformance with this Privacy Notice and/or when required by law.</p> <br><p>From time to time, Philips may sell a business or a part of a business to another company. Such a transfer of ownership could include the transfer of your personal data directly related to that business to the purchasing company.</p><br> <h3>Your rights</h3> <p>Once you have provided us with your personal data, you have reasonable access to that information so that you can update, modify or, if legally possible, delete it. For My Philips you may do this by logging into your account and accessing your "personal settings", where you can also change your preferences relating to how Philips communicates with you. You may also make these requests regarding your personal data by contacting Philips at <a href="mailto:privacy@philips.com">privacy@philips.com</a> </p><br><p>You will also be provided with an opt-out opportunity when necessary and we will comply with any local legislation.</p><br><p>We encourage you to keep your personal settings and personal data complete and current.</p><br><h3>Your choices</h3><p>We want to know you better so we can serve you better while at the same time respecting your choices about how we use your personal data.</p><br><p>Your personal data may be transferred from your home country to other Philips companies, in different locations around the world, which may communicate with you about Philips products, services or special offers that you may be interested in. If local law requires it, we will ask for prior consent to transfer your personal data outside of your geographic region.</p><br><p>If you do not want us to send you personalised offers or information, you can let us know by checking the appropriate box on the registration form or reply card, or by selecting "opt-out" on emails you receive.</p><br><p>Where local law requires it, we will ask you to "opt-in" or affirmatively consent to the processing of your personal data. For example, where local law so requires, we will only send you newsletters if you have subscribed to them. Similarly, where local law so requires, we will ask you to "opt-in" before using sophisticated profiling techniques.</p> <br> <p>Because Philips sells thousands of products in hundreds of countries, you may have previously provided us with your personal data through reply cards, via our call centres or in some other manner. Your decision not to register now will not affect the personal data you have already provided to Philips. Of course, you will always have the option to unsubscribe from any targeted communication from Philips or change your personal profile information.</p> <br>  <h3>Do Not Track Signals</h3>   <p>Philips takes privacy and security very seriously, and strives to put our website users first in all aspects of our business.

These websites may operate independently from Philips, and may have their own privacy notices, statements or policies. We strongly suggest that you review them to understand how your personal data may be processed in connection with those sites, as we are not responsible for the content of non-Philips-owned or -managed sites, or the use or privacy practices of those sites.</p><br>   <h3>Cloud</h3>     <p>Philips may store your personal data in a cloud. This means that your personal data may be processed on behalf of Philips by a cloud service provider and could be stored in different locations around the world.

If you believe we have collected personal data from a person who is under the age of 16, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@philips.com">privacy@philips.com</a> </p><br> <h3>Changes to this Privacy Notice</h3>  <p>The services that Philips provides are always evolving and the form and nature of the services that Philips provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.

We use cookies for:<br><ol><li>Keeping track of the number of visitors to our web pages</li><li>Keeping track of the length of time that each visitor spends on our web pages</li><li>Determining the order in which a visitor visits the various pages on our website</li><li>Assessing which parts of our site need to be improved</li><li>Optimising the website</li></ol>	<h3>Cookies for displaying advertisements</h3>Our website displays advertisements (or video messages) to you, which may use cookies.<br><br>By using cookies we can:<br><ol><li>keep track of which advertisements you have already been shown so that you are not always shown the same ones</li><li>keep track of how many visitors click on the advertisement </li><li>keep track of how many orders are placed by way of the advertisement </li></ol><br><p>Even if such cookies are not used, however, you may still be shown advertisements that do not utilise cookies. These advertisements can, for instance, be modified according to the content of the website. You can compare this type of content-related Internet advertisements with advertising on television. If, say, you are watching a cookery programme on TV, you will often see an advertisement about cooking products during the advert breaks while this programme is on.</p><br><h3>Cookies for behaviour-related content of a web page</h3>Our aim is to provide visitors to our website with information that is as relevant as possible to them. We therefore endeavour to adapt our site as much as possible to every visitor. We do this not only through the content of our website, but also through the advertisements shown.<br><br>To make it possible for these adaptations to be carried out, we try to acquire a picture of your likely interests on the basis of the Philips websites that you visit in order to develop a segmented profile. Based on these interests, we then adapt the content and the advertisements on our website for various groups of customers. For instance, based upon your surfing behaviour, you may have similar interests to the 'males in the 30-to-45 age range, married with children and interested in football' category. This group will, of course, be shown different advertisements to the 'female, 20-to-30 age range, single and interested in travelling' category.<br><br>Third parties that set cookies via our website may also try to find out what your interests are in this way. In this case, the information about your current website visit may be combined with information from previous visits to websites other than ours.<br>Even if such cookies are not used, please note that you will be provided with advertisements on our site; however, these advertisements will not be tailored to your interests.<br><br>These cookies make it possible for:<br><ol><li>the websites to record your visit and, as a result, to assess your interests</li><li>a check to be run to see if you have clicked on an advertisement</li><li>information about your surfing behaviour to be passed to other websites</li><li>third-party services to be used to show you advertisements</li><li>more interesting advertisements to be displayed on the basis of your social media usage</li></ol><h3>Cookies for sharing the content of our website via social media</h3>The articles, pictures and videos that you look at on our website can be shared and liked via social media by means of buttons.
