			It is amazing how much confidence you engender, Phil………..I knew the 1% a day trades and repeated often were possible as I had done in stretches, and I knew kill zone trades were also possible and 5% to 10% returns per month were very possible with practice, experience and smart risk management all without having to take a lot of risk, but I guess I was talking to the disbelievers and since I have dropped them into my 'why bother to try to explain it' file and come over to the dark side at PSW I feel soooo much more content not only with the returns, but with the company and a comments and the obvious opportunity to learn and learn and learn some more.
 
It all helps the mental and emotional discipline of the trading too. So thanks again.		</p>

			On Optrader's section yesterday he was asked how he works with AAPL as an investment. He replied that he just ‘plays with the covers'. I've got a separate portfolio where I use primarily this technique over the past 6 months. Up 60% The principles involved are stock selection, patience, patience, using covers to protect profits, rolling covers to maximize premium return, and exiting when covers are gone and stock price is high. Sometimes it's hard to remember where you learn to do this stuff, but much of it is from integrating principles I've learned here with thing I already knew. Thanks for the help on this, Phil and others.		</p>

			Phil – I think I finally figured out your "crystal ball" time frame.  You're about 5-14 days AHEAD of what the market is going to do.  It's taken me a long time to realize this, but boy it's been profitable.  I go in when you recommend something at about 25% allocation, and then add to it each day it "goes the wrong way"  Then BOOM, one day it's all good….   The long put list was literally exact in it's timing.		</p>

			Phil - I am 3 month follower and shout a big thanks for all the good advice and training. I read all the materials and posts as suggested. I am retired CFO and took over my investments 2 years ago from broker after frustration with returns. I followed some conservative advice for retirees and have 60% bonds currently in a 5m portfolio. I had been doing covered calls on my stocks to boost returns and slowly am getting more aggressive after following your site and my son who has been with you for 6 months. I allocated 1.5m to stocks and am scaling up from 30%. I did some of the trades suggested in early June using Aug &amp; Oct buy/writes on CSCO, WMT, MON, WFR, DO in addition to calls on XOM, CVX, PEP, PG, WM, T that I owned. Most are doing very well (4-24%) in 60 days.  My good problem is that instead of getting longer, I will be making 6% quickly (50% plus annualized) and getting called away on many positions.  What would you advise for getting long again.  Thanks again for such a great job advising all of us!		</p>

			I've recently done exactly what Phil described.  I upgraded my ability to trade the IRA acct. by  transferring acct. from TDA to TOS.  TDA would not allow spreads; TOS does.  Neither will allow naked options.  With spreads I am able to buy calls or puts several months out then sell front month calls or puts over and over.  This allows me to collect premium, which is, of course, the goal.  This wasn't an original idea.  Phil put me onto it.  Since the transfer I've substantially increased my performance in the IRA!		</p>

			I'm just starting my second year as a member, and I'd like to thank all of you for sharing your trading ideas and insight, and especially Phil of course for great all-around investing advice as well as trades!  In addition to learning patience and profit-taking, I think one of the most important things I'm learning here is to stick to stocks and trades that suit my temperament. And wow, I had NO idea how hard it was to learn patience.  I should say "practice" instead of "learn", because it seems to be a constant struggle.  Phil, please keep reminding us how nice CASH is!		</p>

			Phil - I celebrate today, having reached my goal for the year,  trading in sync with your education and guidance, of 1 million in profit. I learned a lot, achieved much, and am profoundly grateful.  To be honest, when I set the goal I thought it was daunting, as I have for many years been an investor in equities but did very little with options. Learning and doing has for me been a blast!
I reached my goal by following Phil's strategies - lots of Buy/Writes, covered calls on equities , naked put entries for income production.  I did it with 2.5 mil and kept 600,000 in cash in case I got in trouble. I concentrated on stocks (many of my own choosing) that had decent dividends and wrote front month calls against (OTM) which has worked well in this market run. 25% of my gain is in dividends and premium selling, with the balance in appreciation.		</p>

			You may wonder if anyone gets anything out of you seminars (or may not wonder). Anyway, I almost never day trade because of my job. Today, I was home due to the snow and since I was behind by 2 weeks on watching your recorded seminars I though I would watch one of them. I set up my pivot point charts in TOS to match the ones in your seminar and made the QQQ trade from this morning. I only bought 5 puts. While I watched the seminar, I would pause then switch back and forth and watch the live QQQ chart. I ended up stopping out for a $170 gain, but it was pretty cool to have the dip and recovery at the same time I was learning the art of stopping out when a pivot line was taken out.		</p>

			Phil/Everyone here/Thank you - What everyone here with their insightful comments (including yourself) has helped me with is that I'm greatly increasing my ability to trade more psychologically neutral, although I've got a ways to go. Two years ago I'd wake up early and my heart would race if futures weren't pointing exactly how I wanted… I've noticed an exponential leap in my discipline skills especially over this past two weeks. The old me would have ran with that trade for profits without even asking. Now I know that there are ALWAYS more trades and that I have PLENTY of options to turn a bad trade even. Also, it's more logical and less emotionally draining which lets me focus my faculties on my wife, college, my job, and studying for the ol' Series 7. Would it be safe to say that one of the most important skills to develop is the ability to adjust? I'd love to get to the point where I can look at a bracket and know, for example, what I need to sell for cover in what month in order to get my desired results. Both COF and my past DMM venture have been excellent learning experiences. Thanks, everyone. I look forward to further lessons.		</p>

			PSW AC Conf:  For those who may be on the bubble, I attended my first PSW LV in November.  It was a real eye-opener.  What I accomplished in a couple of days of exposure to Phil, Pharm, Craig, et al made my previous couple of years of hanging around the web site seem silly.  If you are inclined in the slightest, you really should go.  Just rubbing shoulders with other PSW members proved to be really valuable.  Strictly on the basis of value, it's a great deal.  You will have real time conversations with Phil and the gang and they will get to your questions and agenda items.		</p>

			Thx Phil.  Lightly moving in the bullish direction.  Took PFE for $14.35 and sold the Jan 11 C/P for $2.85 giving me a net entry below Mar 09 low.  And I bought back those calls on BTU and JPM I asked about the other day and am leaving them uncovered for now, so feeling better.  Still just learning the rhythm.
In the three months I have been using your system, my little portfolio is up 9.9%, so not only am I learning, but I am APPLYING that knowledge, and it's paying off.  Thanks.		</p>

			Boring trading – Phil/  Thanks to PSW, my yearly covered-writes are on pace for 15%.  Add the long puts and well over 20%… and I look at it once a day and never lose sleep over it.  Actually doing better than my trading account at this point (Thanks, summer 2013)

Anyway, the point is that anyone with enough money would be wise to do the 20% – 40% stuff and do trading as a hobby…		</p>

			I don't post much, but I guess this morning has brought me out.  This site has made me tens of thousands, every year since I have become a member.  It took me nearly two years devoting 3 hours per day to get on the ball, and actually understand portion sizing, and which trades fit my personal trading style.  Before that I spent at least two years working on Buffet style fundamental investing.  (Intellegent Investor, Security Analysis, ect.).  This site really will teach you amazing things if you just pay attention.  Literally it has changed my day to day life, has allowed my family and I to move back to the U.S. from overseas with confidence even with a paycut at my day job, and literally put me in a different league financially.  Seriously my life and my children's is better because of this site.		</p>

			Phil: Once again thanks for those inciteful comments, and the old links to Sage's portfolio management (I hadn't read before).  I'm an experienced stock trader, but over the last 3 or 4 months have come to appreciate options trading here at PSW, and the consistency of your many premium-selling strategies.  It is liberating to have to worry less about getting direction right and being able to generate 5% MONTHLY returns with close to delta-neutral positioning.  Much appreciated!		</p>

		Everybody knows they should buy low and sell high, but few traders have the psychological fortitude to actually stick with the plan. When shares are cheap there are always negatives that get well publicized.

		Fund managers and guest hosts on CNBC are much more prone to&nbsp;explain&nbsp;price weakness while acting as if they had predicted it, than to recommend buying shares that are currently bargains, but sport ‘bad charts’.

</p>

<p>
	This happy story is wrong on multiple counts.
</p>

<p>
	The conventional view of the Baby Boomers' retirement is a happy story:&nbsp;since we're living longer and remaining productive longer, Boomers will not be as much of a burden on Gen-X and Gen-Y as doom-and-gloomers assume.
</p>

<p>
	Not only are Boomers staying productive longer, they will draw upon their vast generational wealth as they age, limiting the financial burden on younger generations.
</p>

<p>
	This happy story is nicely summarized in this lengthy piece&nbsp;<a href="http://theamericanscholar.org/the-fear-factor/" target="resource">The Fear Factor:</a><a href="http://theamericanscholar.org/the-fear-factor/" target="resource">&nbsp;Long-held predictions of economic chaos as baby boomers grow old are based on formulas that...</a></p>		<br><br>

		<p>Courtesy of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/"><strong>Doug Short</strong></a>.</p>  <p>Earlier today we learned that the Third Estimate for Q1 2014 real GDP came in at -2.93 percent (rounded to 2.9 percent), down from -1.0 percent in the Second Estimate and well below most forecasts. Real GDP per capita was even lower at -3.53 percent.</p>  <p>Here is a chart of real GDP per capita growth since 1960. For this analysis I've chained in today's dollar for the inflation adjustment. The per-capita calculation is based on quarterly aggregates of mid-month population estimates by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which date from 1959 (hence my 1960 starting date for this chart, even though quarterly GDP has is available since 1947).

Despite extremely overbought technical conditions and regional hot spots that may ultimately threaten global economic recovery, investors seem undeterred. Indeed, all major central banks are now onboard the liquidity bandwagon, and although bonds have not sold off as many expected (to create a Great Rotation into equities), most income and total return-seeking investors in the U.S. see little in the way of attractive alternatives to equities.</p> <p>	The economic data continues to indicate improvement in the U.S. economy.

	First, the media is on a tear against biotechs/pharma, ripping companies for their drug prices.&nbsp; Gilead's HepC drug, Sovaldi, is priced at $84K for the 12-week treatment.&nbsp; Pundits were screaming bloody murder that it was a total rip off, but when one investigates the other drugs out there, and the consequences of not taking Sovaldi vs. another drug combinations, then things become clearer.&nbsp; For instance, <a href="http://www.olysio.com/" target="_blank">Olysio (JNJ) </a>is about $66,000 for a 12-week treatment, but is approved for <u>fewer types of patients</u> AND...</p>		<br><br>
