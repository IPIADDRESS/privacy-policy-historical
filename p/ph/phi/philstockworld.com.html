			I took $2 (up 133%) and ran on those USO puts, quite a bit more than the 20 you played in the $25KP.  Thank you once again for turning a bad market week into a great personal week.  You will be happy to know I am back to cashy and cautious with a few of your favorite longs into the weekend.  Thanks to Phil, JRW and all the members who share their knowledge here.		</p>

			Peace of mind / I have a portfolio mainly consisting of long term long calls, short term short calls and puts, and long term BCS. Three years, ago when I started my journey on this board I would be freaking out panicking as to what to do, as many of the short calls are ITM, Three years later (today) I look at the screen and serenely process the information. Three years ago, I inevitably made the wrong decisions which cost me a lot of money. Three years on I calmly roll the positions to whatever makes sense. No drama, no hair pulling, and a great cost saver. I guess they call that the power of education.		</p>

			BTW Phil, I wanted to relate a conversation I had with my business partner yesterday. I told him that I have been much more relaxed about my investments ever since I joined your site. It's funny how a 15-20% cushion does to your nerves. My returns have increased dramatically and my risk diminished. Many thanks for the guidance and patience. Good thing I am doing better financially as you might have increased my life expectancy as well!		</p>

			Phil – I think I finally figured out your "crystal ball" time frame.  You're about 5-14 days AHEAD of what the market is going to do.  It's taken me a long time to realize this, but boy it's been profitable.  I go in when you recommend something at about 25% allocation, and then add to it each day it "goes the wrong way"  Then BOOM, one day it's all good….   The long put list was literally exact in it's timing.		</p>

			I would like to thank Phil and PSW crew for the insight and assistance (even the liberals).
 
In December I initiated long stock positions buying stock, writing calls and puts in AAPL, WFR and CHK (scaling in and out).  Over the last week I have been trimming back my positions selling stock and taking out my callers and putters. I am now back to my initial 25% position that I started with in December. However this time, my cost basis on shares AAPL, WFR, and CHK is $0! With money to spare from those positions.		</p>

			I don't post much, but I guess this morning has brought me out.  This site has made me tens of thousands, every year since I have become a member.  It took me nearly two years devoting 3 hours per day to get on the ball, and actually understand portion sizing, and which trades fit my personal trading style.  Before that I spent at least two years working on Buffet style fundamental investing.  (Intellegent Investor, Security Analysis, ect.).  This site really will teach you amazing things if you just pay attention.  Literally it has changed my day to day life, has allowed my family and I to move back to the U.S. from overseas with confidence even with a paycut at my day job, and literally put me in a different league financially.  Seriously my life and my children's is better because of this site.		</p>

			GIVE THANKS/PHIL
Have not done my 10,000 hours, but a couple of years at PSW, and moved from fishing with a single line to owner of a commercial trawler (metaphorically speaking). Now I fish with many lines. It is amazing when you go over the same information time and time again, eventually it clicks. Like planting trees; being the house, 20% sale items, selling into the excitement. and patience. I just sold an AAPL Jan 12 340/390 BCS financed by the sales of Jan 12 275 Put. The trade was put on one year ago for a net credit and exited five minutes ago for a 49 dollar per contract profit. No point in waiting till opex to see what happens, and I will just sell 10 of those VLO puts to make myself net the round 50.
I no longer worry about opex coming as I have adjusted well in time for most positions that go against me. I still make some howlers (RIMM, TBT, TRGT) but I play the percentages and my winners outdistance my losers by many miles. 
I would never be in this position if it were not for Phil. He is a treasure, pure and simple. The goose that lays the golden egg if we care to listen and practice. Phil, a mighty big thank you.		</p>

			I discovered PSW while reading up on the US economy and how it applies to all the poor folk of the world and to myself as a humble UK desk slave.

This year I put time into learning options trading. I upgraded (with great administrative difficulty!) my stock dealing account to deal options. Now I am an avid reader of PSW and subscribed for voyeur membership. Initially feeling out of my depth struggling to keep up with the peculiar language of options traders, I unsubscribed feeling a little under confident and uncertain if the small stake I have to invest in options could generate enough to justify my PSW subscription.  Nevertheless, I've benefited considerably from the member's material. From a small number of initial trades, I've exceeded profit targets enough to consider re-subscribing in some capacity.   Thanks for the knowledge and more than anything I appreciate the human angle, the humour and the ecologically sympathetic approach rarely seen in other financial media.  Best wishes all - Jon		</p>

			Great call on expe Phil! Went long 50 shares and sold for a nice profit! And Great call on the nkd shorts as well. I didn't use a stop that tight and was able to cover for a $400 gain. Works been keeping me pretty busy and I'm jealous of all the members who are able to check in here more often! It's almost always quite profitable! Looking forward to Vegas!		</p>

			Phil - I am 3 month follower and shout a big thanks for all the good advice and training. I read all the materials and posts as suggested. I am retired CFO and took over my investments 2 years ago from broker after frustration with returns. I followed some conservative advice for retirees and have 60% bonds currently in a 5m portfolio. I had been doing covered calls on my stocks to boost returns and slowly am getting more aggressive after following your site and my son who has been with you for 6 months. I allocated 1.5m to stocks and am scaling up from 30%. I did some of the trades suggested in early June using Aug &amp; Oct buy/writes on CSCO, WMT, MON, WFR, DO in addition to calls on XOM, CVX, PEP, PG, WM, T that I owned. Most are doing very well (4-24%) in 60 days.  My good problem is that instead of getting longer, I will be making 6% quickly (50% plus annualized) and getting called away on many positions.  What would you advise for getting long again.  Thanks again for such a great job advising all of us!		</p>

			Thanks, after years of blood and blunders, I have reached a significant milestone – I don't lose money.  Net net, I rarely have a losing week, market up, market down.  And that I owe to you. Balanced positions.  More premium sold than bought.  Fundamental criteria applied to good companies, not momentum/ news headlines/ stock du jour/ triangle squeezies. But rather earnings, P/E, dividends, competitive position — the boring stuff that takes study, thought,….and patience.  You have been a great teacher, and I have embarassed myself repeatedly day with how slowly I learn. 
 
And it's a funny thing – if you don't lose, the gains start to pile up.  The arithmetic is cruel to the downside, and becomes a gift in the other direction.  And I'm in this for the long run, having made myself unemployable through a need for diversification.   Moreover, what I've learned here has also elided into other areas, including real estate and ex-U.S. investment.  Pretty cool.  Have a great weekend.		</p>

			PSW AC Conf:  For those who may be on the bubble, I attended my first PSW LV in November.  It was a real eye-opener.  What I accomplished in a couple of days of exposure to Phil, Pharm, Craig, et al made my previous couple of years of hanging around the web site seem silly.  If you are inclined in the slightest, you really should go.  Just rubbing shoulders with other PSW members proved to be really valuable.  Strictly on the basis of value, it's a great deal.  You will have real time conversations with Phil and the gang and they will get to your questions and agenda items.		</p>

			Why were the analysts wrong?  
If I were a Japanese investor who purchased US stocks prior to November at Y80 yen to the dollar, with the US market up an average of 15% or more and upon  selling the asset I covert dollars  to Yen, also realizing an additional 25% gain (one dollar now converts to 100+ Yen rather than the 80 I used at time of purchase), I think I would be unloading US assets also.
But analysts never do the math in their articles nor very rarely bring up or discuss the ramifications of currency fluctuations. I don't include Phil in this group as this is a valuable lesson I am learning from him.		</p>

			Phil has some great insight into the market. He's given me a different perspective on the market and I know I'm a better trader/investor because of it.

I've been trading options since the late 80's and Phil is right. Unless you know what is going to happen (how can you, unless you have insider information), then do what the smart money does - be the house. Remember guys, we're allowed to sell options. If you're afraid to be short, then do a spread to limit your liability. When I think about the money I've made and lost on options, a good approximation is that I win 30% of the time when I do a straight buy; I win about 70% of the time when I do a spread; I win nearly 90% of the time when I sell naked.		</p>

			I traded with Phil for approximately three years, and consistently averaged 80% returns yearly... some of which was due to my skills as a trader, but much was a direct result of what I learned as a member of Phil's site.... both from Phil, and the many talented traders that hang out there.  Phil... if you are reading along... thanks, again for the approximately $ 3 mil I made tagging along with you.... in order to make you feel good for the work you did... I gave the government 50% of it all, so you made your contribution....		</p>

			I'm just starting my second year as a member, and I'd like to thank all of you for sharing your trading ideas and insight, and especially Phil of course for great all-around investing advice as well as trades!  In addition to learning patience and profit-taking, I think one of the most important things I'm learning here is to stick to stocks and trades that suit my temperament. And wow, I had NO idea how hard it was to learn patience.  I should say "practice" instead of "learn", because it seems to be a constant struggle.  Phil, please keep reminding us how nice CASH is!		</p>

			WOW, look at DRYS go.  Nice call on the entry the other week Phil.  I got 200 at $6.66 and sold a 7.5 call for $.50, then on the tear today sold another 7.5 call for $1.  This should puts me in at an average of $5.91 and called away at $7.5 for a profit of $300+ after commisions.  Once again another Phil trade pays for this months membership.		</p>

			Man, what a week: Bought C at 1.40, sold half at 1.59 (relatively big position), another quarter at 3.04 just now.  Ran SKF down from 270 with one April put, still holding some 115's expiring in a couple days.  I'm going to gamble this position like a champion Friday. Bought FAS at all sorts of levels and started cashing out.  Long HOV, stock and some nickel calls for fun - Mocha up your buy-out from 5 to 8 and that's 10,900% return for the May-2.50's . Ha!		</p>

FWIW - This site is my brokerage firm, I was with Wells Fargo Portfolio and it was costing a fortune to trade, the costs here are more than offset with the data, trade ideas and profits you should make.. and I get a chuckle out of Cap and Phil's rantings on healtcare, guns, oh, yeah, and government….		</p>

<p>
	Investors in U.S. equities seem to have embraced a new market paradigm in which upside spikes come more swiftly than the downside selloffs. Remember when it used to be the other way around? When fear was stronger than greed? The market is consolidating its gains off the early-October V-bottom reversal, and no one seems to be in any hurry to unload shares this time around, with the holidays rapidly approaching and all. After all, there are bright blue skies directly overhead giving hope and respite from the early freeze blanketing the country.

	If you&nbsp;would have supposed that Ukraine had enough problems to make banning bitcoins a backburner issue, you'd have been wrong. The rationale, "to protect consumers' rights" makes little to no sense... The other one, "to keep money in the country" makes more sense.&nbsp;

	By Andrew Wilkinson&nbsp;at Interactive Brokers
</p>


	<p>
		A four-year low for the spot price of gold has had a devastating impact on Yamana Gold (Ticker: AUY), with shares in the name down at the lowest price in six years. Some option traders were especially keen to sell premium and appear to see few signs of a lasting rebound within the next five months. The price of gold suffered again Wednesday as the dollar strengthened and stock prices advanced. The post price of gold fell to $1145 adding further pain to share prices of gold miners. Shares in Yamana Gold tumbled to $3.62 and the lowest price since 2008 as call option sellers used the April expiration contract to write premium at the $5.00 strike. That strike is now 38% above the price of the stock. Premium writers took in around 16-cents per contract o...</p>		<br><br>

	Well PSW Subscribers....I am still here, barely.&nbsp; From my last post a few months ago to now, nothing has changed much, but there are a few bargins out there that as investors, should be put on the watch list (again) and if so desired....buy a small amount.
