			Praising PSW for enlightenment is a bit akin to praising the Pope for being holy.  I've been reading PSW for about two months now and have learned more about investing technique and the world in general than I've learned from the books and seminars I've paid for. Thanks for the enlightenment, the education, the guidance and the truth, which is not a commodity these days, but a virtue in short supply.		</p>

			Hi Phil,

Thanks for the free disaster hedge ideas. I implemented variations of two of them on SDS bull call spreads and EEM bear put spreads (haven't done the TZA yet) and they really hedged my short term longs nicely today. Makes it seem a lot less like gambling.

You are the man (of the people)!		</p>

			Personally I admire and respect you disciplined approach to investing.  My style is at the extreme side of aggressive and I have to learn how to be less that way.  If I yell " Let it Ride" at my house, no one says a word so I can't use that to temper my behavior.  Phil has done a pretty good job of knocking some of my potential moves and as a result, I have increased my portfolio value by almost 25% since late July.		</p>

			Phil - I am 3 month follower and shout a big thanks for all the good advice and training. I read all the materials and posts as suggested. I am retired CFO and took over my investments 2 years ago from broker after frustration with returns. I followed some conservative advice for retirees and have 60% bonds currently in a 5m portfolio. I had been doing covered calls on my stocks to boost returns and slowly am getting more aggressive after following your site and my son who has been with you for 6 months. I allocated 1.5m to stocks and am scaling up from 30%. I did some of the trades suggested in early June using Aug &amp; Oct buy/writes on CSCO, WMT, MON, WFR, DO in addition to calls on XOM, CVX, PEP, PG, WM, T that I owned. Most are doing very well (4-24%) in 60 days.  My good problem is that instead of getting longer, I will be making 6% quickly (50% plus annualized) and getting called away on many positions.  What would you advise for getting long again.  Thanks again for such a great job advising all of us!		</p>

This is the grand finale of several successful trades from you through this roller-coster and as you have further suggested it is time for me to sit back and relax in cash.

			Being a bear is easy (and I am not convinced we are doing all that well on the whole as an economy), but one cannot fight the trend (didn't Phil say that a while ago)?  Just cover, make 5-10-15-20% and move on.  It really does add up by chipping away.  All I can say is I am back to 2007 levels in my account b'f the crash with this run up and some very nice help on this board….so kudos to us (and me!!)…		</p>

			Phil:  I am always able to figure out your trades, including the rational when put in the right context of previous comments, etc. Keep doing what you're doing. It is much appreciated, and invaluable. Your hit rate of successful trades has been very high in my 1.5 months as a member, but even more importantly is your teaching of how to repair and DD positions that haven't gone your way yet. As with most members, we all have our ‘pet' trading interests, and learning how to think about trading is much more important than a specific trade, which could see the conditions behind it change an hour later. This is the classic case, of ‘Teach us to Fish', rather than just giving us a fish once in a while. Thank you!		</p>

			Speaking of the "Man Who Planted Trees", it really works.  I bought BTU back in March at $49.87.  I practically bought it at the tippy top.  However, I soon afterward found this site, started learning Phil's methodology(and those in the strategy section) and began selling calls/puts regularly against my bad position.  As of yesterday, I still own the original 100 shares, but have brought my basis down by over $11.00.  Couldn't be happier, what started out as a really bad entry, I have managed to work down to a good basis.  Had I not watched that video and learned your system, I would sold out of the position, and been kicking myself for making such a bad entry.		</p>

			Kudos on the POT puts! I studied the charts last night and you couldn't have hit the inflection points more perfectly. Since there are often many head fakes in the charts, that was very well done. I know they can't all work this well, but that was an extra unexpected bonus yesterday.		</p>

Atleast now when I see something go in the red I know how much I'm going to loose and that I will profit somewhere else and have enough money left at the end of the day to trade again.

The educational material alone is worth several times the price of admission.

			Peter D, Just a note of thanks. Eight weeks ago, I entered my first RUT strangles, when the RUT was at 625.  Tomorrow, I will let them expire, with the RUT at 625 (give or take).  I didn't care when the RUT went to 650, nor when it dropped to 590.  Easiest, no touch money I've made in a long time.		</p>

The November Mortgage Monitor report released by Lender Processing Services, Inc. (LPS) shows that the volume of loans moving to REO continued to drop as moratoria further delayed foreclosure sales. While the 90+ delinquency category has steadily declined, the number of loans moving to seriously delinquent status beyond 90 days far outpaced the number of foreclosure starts. Nearly 2.2 million loans are 90 days or more delinquent but not yet in foreclosure.<br>

		<p>Forecasts Forecasts Forecasts</p>
<p>Everyone is coming out with forecasts.</p>
<p>What do we think about that? We don't, why? The most dangerous thing to do is to become emotionally attached to someone's forecast or what they THINK the market is going to do. We all know better right? The last thing we want to do is read a DOW a gazzillon points higher by year end 2011 and hang our hat on that.</p>
<p>What if it doesn't come to fruition? What if it doesn't happen and rolls over with us mentally attached to that outcome? We get crushed. Thanks anyway.</p>
<p>What we at All About Trends prefer to focus upon is the reality of what is and what is developing all based upon what we see via technical analysis vs. think. We've seen it time and time again around here. We watch what the indexes and leading stocks are actually doing and yes more often than not we end up being buyers when everyone is a seller and a seller when everyone is a buyer.</p>
<p>So what's our forecast?</p>

<strong>The markets traded mostly flat on Monday on limited volume and news. The market appeared ready for a bounce in pre-market with extended excitement over the tax cut extensions, but the market quickly changed its tune and began to sell off and remained flat for most of the day, only dropping as low as fifty points down before recovering before the close and ending mixed. The midday rally, though, shows some definite bullishness in the market, and it should be viewed as something positive rather than negative.</strong>

The Dow finished up down nearly 14 points. The Nasdaq finished up nearly 7. The S&amp;P 500 finished up 3. Gold finished up nearly 7.<br>
