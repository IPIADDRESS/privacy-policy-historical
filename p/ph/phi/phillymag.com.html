unanticipated security breach.</b></p>

<p><b>Aggregate Information Collection and Use</b></p>

<p>We collect and use non-identifying and aggregate information to improve
the content of our Web pages,
for systems administration, and trouble-shooting purposes.  This
information may be shared with other
organizations for commercial purposes and with Philadelphia Magazine
affiliates. This kind of information
includes which pages you visit, how many pages you visit, the search

<p><b>Personal Information Collection and Use</b></p>

<p>We also collect any information that you volunteer, such as your name,
email address, mailing address,
telephone number, or credit card information ("Personal Information").  We
request this information when

collect online.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to share both aggregate and personal information
collected from you with third
parties if we are authorized to do so, if the law requires it, to protect
the rights of Philadelphia
Magazine, or as part of a sale or other disposition of our assets
(including our membership and/or
customer records).  We may also use and disclose Personal Information to
prevent or trace abuses of the
Site, including but not limited to use of a Forum.  We may also use and
disclose Personal Information  to
comply with any court order or government investigation or inquiry, or as
otherwise required by law, or
to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Philadelphia

<p><b>Purchases</b></p>

<p>If you make a purchase on our Site, including a subscription for a

number, and the expiration date.  If
the product or subscription is provided or shipped by a third party, we
will pass on to the third party
the information needed to fulfill your order.</p>

<p><b>Promotions and Contests</b></p>

<p>Philadelphia Magazine may from time to time sponsor sweepstakes,
contests, or other events
("Promotions") which require the collection, processing, and storage of
individual contact information
plus demographic information.  These Promotions may also ask registrants
to answer survey questions.  Any
personally identifiable information collected through promotions will be
treated as "Personal
Information," as defined above.  No purchase is ever necessary to enter a
Philadelphia Magazine
Promotion.  Please see the official rules of each Promotion for more
information.</p>

<p>Philadelphia Magazine may co-sponsor Promotions with other companies,
in which case any information
collected is likely to be shared with other participating sponsors, who
may use this information as they
wish.  A registrant's personal contact and demographic information will
not be released to any
third-party organization other than named sponsors without the
registrant's consent.</p>

<p><b>Chats, Clubs, Forums, and Message Boards </b></p>

<p>Please consult our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a> for a
description of our chats, clubs,
forums, and message boards ("Forum").  You should be aware that any
Personal Information, such as your
name and email address, as well as any other information or content that
you post on a Forum, or
otherwise specifically and knowingly disclose by use of a Forum, may be
directly collected and used by
Philadelphia Magazine and third parties.  Therefore, you may receive
unsolicited email as a result of
your disclosure of such information.  <b>You should have no expectation of
privacy with respect to your
communications through these forums. </b></p>

<p><b>Surveys and Polls</b></p>

<p>Philadelphia Magazine will from time to time conduct anonymous surveys
and polls of users to the Site
to obtain aggregate demographic information about them.  Such information
may be compiled and shared in
the aggregate with advertisers and other third parties, but no personal
details will be traceable or
associated with specific individuals. </p> 

<p><b>Cookies</b></p>

<p>Philadelphia Magazine does not use Cookies at the present time.  In the
future, however, users to this
