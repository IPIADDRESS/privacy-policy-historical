        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This Privacy Policy was last revised on October 29, 2009.</p> 

<p>PHP Fog, Inc. ("PHP Fog," "we," or "us") knows that you care how information about you is used and shared.  This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by PHP Fog when you use the PHP Fog Service, how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information.   Our basic principles are:</p> 

<ul> 
<li>We won't spam you or sell your personal information to others.</li> 
<li>You control how we send most messages to you.</li> 
<li>You control who you share your Applications with.</li> 
<li>We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</li> 
</ul> 


<p>We will only collect, use, and share your information as we describe in this Privacy Policy or as  you give us express permission to do.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources.  Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our <a href="tos">Terms of Service</a>.</p> 

<h2>Information We Collect</h2> 

<p><strong>User-Provided Information:</strong>  You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, when you register for an account with the Service.  You also provide us information in the Content and Application(s) you post to the Service.  If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses.  If you sign up for a paid subscription to the Service, we will ask you for your credit card information, which we store in encrypted form.</p> 

<p><strong>Cookies Information:</strong>  When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets PHP Fog help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.  A cookie may also convey anonymous information about how you browse the Service to us.  A cookie does not collect personal information about you.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browserâ€™s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p> 

<p><strong>Log File Information:</strong>  Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page.  When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p> 

<p><strong>Clear Gifs Information:</strong>  When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously.  No personally identifiable information from your PHP Fog account is collected using these clear gifs.  In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.  The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make PHP Fog better for our users.</p> 

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2> 

<p>We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.</p> 

<p>By providing PHP Fog your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail.  We may use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or special offers.  If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your "My Account page".</p> 

<p>Following termination or deactivation of your account, PHP Fog may retain your profile information, Content, and Application for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes.  Furthermore, PHP Fog may retain and continue to use indefinitely all Content contained in your communications to other users or posted to public or semi-public areas of the Service after termination or deactivation of your account.</p> 

<p>If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to the Service, we will ask you for that person's email address and automatically send an email invitation.  PHP Fog stores this information to send this email, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database at privacy@phpfog.com.</p> 

<p>PHP Fog may use certain information about you and/or your Application internally for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content.</p> 

<p>PHP Fog reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or remove the Content you post on the Service if in our sole opinion such Content violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Service, or to protect or defend our rights or property or those of any third party.  PHP Fog also reserves the right to remove Content upon the request of any third party.</p> 

<p>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as activity, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses; and (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (h) track Content and users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p> 

<h2>How We Share Your Information</h2> 

<p>Personally Identifiable Information:  PHP Fog will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others.  PHP Fog may share your personally identifiable information with third parties solely for the purpose of providing the Service to you (for instance, to process your credit card transactions).  If we do this, such third partiesâ€™ use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy.  We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of PHP Fog (for instance, on servers in the cloud).</p> 

<p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.</p> 

<p>If you invite another user to share your Application, we will share the Application and associated Content with that user.  You can change your Application sharing settings at any time in you app resource page.  Any Content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to public areas of the Service becomes available to the public.  If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other users have copied or saved that information.</p> 

<p>By subscribing to or enabling an Add-on, you grant PHP Fog permission to share your Application, Content, and user information with the Add-on Provider as necessary in order to provide you the Add-on. We cannot control third partiesâ€™ use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with an Add-on Provider, you can choose not to subscribe to or enable Add-ons.</p> 

<p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, PHP Fog will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our <a href="tos">Terms of Service</a>, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of PHP Fog, our users or others.</p> 

<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:  We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain PHP Fog services.</p> 

<h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2> 

<p>PHP Fog uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information and implement your Application sharing settings. <!-- Our current security measures are described here [link]. -->  We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to PHP Fog or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk.</p> 

<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</p> 

<h2>Compromise of Personal Information</h2> 

<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, PHP Fog will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p> 

<h2>Your Choices About Your Information</h2> 

<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Service, in which case PHP Fog may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account information and email preferences at any time by logging in to your account on http://phpfog.com.   You can review and correct the information about you that PHP Fog keeps on file by contacting us directly at support@phpfog.com.</p> 

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2> 

<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.  For that reason, PHP Fog does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register as Members. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on PHP Fog. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at privacy@phpfog.com.</p> 

<h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2> 

<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein.  Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p> 

<h2>Notification Procedures</h2> 

<p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the Service, as determined by PHP Fog in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.</p> 

<h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2> 

<p>If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on the Service to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.  Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p> 

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this website, please contact us at privacy@phpfog.com, or send mail to:  PHP Fog, Inc., Privacy, 2732 SE 18th Ave, Portland, OR, 97202.</p>
