       <p> PHPizabi / Real!ty Medias only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of PHPizabi / Real!ty Medias in the following limited circumstances: </p>
       <ul>
         <li>

         <li>           We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of PHPizabi / Real!ty Medias, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>

        <br>
        We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.<br>
        <br>
      Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Information security</h2>
      <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.<br>
        <br>
      We restrict access to personal information to PHPizabi / Real!ty Medias employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Data integrity</h2>
      <p>PHPizabi / Real!ty Medias processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Accessing and updating personal information</h2>
      <p>When you use PHPizabi / Real!ty Medias services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices for these services.</p>

When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is PHPizabi / Real!ty Medias's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between PHPizabi / Real!ty Medias and an individual.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes). Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date.</p></td>
