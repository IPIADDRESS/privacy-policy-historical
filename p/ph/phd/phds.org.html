<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)<br>We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers.&nbsp; This information does not identify individual users.

<h2>Personally identifiable information</h2>
<br>We do not share personally identifiable information with third parties except as specified below.<br><br>
<h3>Service Providers</h3>
We use Akismet to provide spam filtering for comments posted on our site.&nbsp; If you post a comment on blog.phds.org, we will provide your name and email address as well as the contents of your comment to Akismet as part of their spam testing process.&nbsp; Akismet’s privacy policy can be found at http://automattic.com/privacy/<br><br>

<h2>Log Files</h2>
<br>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.&nbsp; This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. &nbsp;<br><br>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. &nbsp;<br><br>We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.<br>&nbsp;<br>We use third-party tracking services, Google Analytics and Quantcast, that use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate such as statistics on site usage and traffic volume.&nbsp; We use this information to improve the site and to describe our site’s audience to prospective advertisers.<br><br>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<br>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. <br><br>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.&nbsp; We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.&nbsp; A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.&nbsp; See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie for more information about cookies.<br><br>We use persistent cookies to store your user name if you request that we remember you when logging in.&nbsp; We also set a persistent cookie to store your geographical location so that we can set default values in forms on the site that ask for your location.<br><br>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use areas of our site that require that you be logged in will be limited. <br><br>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.&nbsp; We have no access to or control over these cookies. See “Third Party Advertisers.”<br><br>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by phds.org only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. [See the “Third Party Advertisers” section.]<br><br>
<h2>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h2>
<br>Our third party advertising partner, Google AdSense, and our third party statistics provider, Quantcast, employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.&nbsp; Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. <br><br>To learn more about our advertising company’s use of clear gifs, please go to http://adsense.google.com and to http://quantcast.com<br><br>
<h2>Third Party Advertisers</h2>
<br>Ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by Google AdSense and DirectTrack, our advertising partners.<br>&nbsp;<br>Google AdSense and DirectTrack may use cookies and/or clear GIFs on this site, which allow them to recognize a user's cookie when a user visits this site. The information that Google AdSense and DirectTrack collects and shares through this technology is not personally identifiable. &nbsp;<br><br>For more information about our third-party advertisers, or to learn more about the choices available to you regarding this anonymous information, please visit http://adsense.google.com and http://www.directtrack.com<br><br>
<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<br>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Collected Insight. Please be aware that we, Collected Insight, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. &nbsp;<br><br>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. &nbsp;<br><br>This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site. <br><br>
<h2>Blog Comments/Forums</h2>
<br>If you use a web forum or post blog comments on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.<br><br>
<h2>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<br>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update it by logging in to your account or by contacting our customer support by visiting http://www.phds.org/contact-info<br><br>
<h2>Business Transitions</h2>
<br>In the event Collected Insight goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.&nbsp; You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.<br><br>
<h2>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h2>
<br>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. &nbsp;<br><br>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.&nbsp; If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.<br><br>
