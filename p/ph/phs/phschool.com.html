<br>
Student progress, work and results from taking Site coursework are collected automatically by this Site: (a) to provide customized content; (b) to assign or link to further coursework or resources; (c) to review and track courseware completion and results; and (d) to provide information that may be usable by teachers, administrators, tutors, parents and students for assessing or fostering student learning and progress. Non-personally identifiable data may be aggregated for statistical use by either the School or Pearson and shared with third parties.</p>
