									<p><strong>Revised September 28, 2005</strong></p>
									<p>Phanfare maintains two privacy policies: one for <em>registered users</em> who 
										use the Phanfare software and service to share their photos and video, and one for <em>guests,</em>
										anyone who is not a Phanfare registered user who visits the Phanfare website or 
										a photo and video album created by Phanfare registered user.</p>
									<h3>Privacy Policy For Phanfare Registered Users</h3>
									<p>This policy applies only to registered Phanfare users.</p>
									<p>
									We want you to know what information we collect about you and give you the 
									choice of how that information is shared with others. We call this "notice" and 
									"choice" and it's at the heart of every decision we make around privacy. We 
									also strive to treat our members as we ourselves would like to be treated.
									</p><p></p>
									<p>Our goal in collecting information about you is to provide you with a better 
										product and be a profitable, enduring company. We have structured this policy 
										as a series of questions and answers to make it as clear as possible, and we 
										have chosen a conversational style versus a legal one. If you have any 
										questions about our privacy policy, or suggestions for making it more clear, 
										email us at
										<a href="mailto:privacy-matters@phanfare.com">privacy-matters@phanfare.com</a>

										<li>
											<a name="whats-collected" class="t"><strong>What information does Phanfare collect 
													about me?</strong></a>
											<p>
												<strong>Registration: </strong>
											When you register for the Phanfare service we collect personal contact 
											information, such as name, address, phone number, and email address. We also 
											collect credit card payment information that is used to bill you for the annual 
											subscription after the initial trial period.
											</p><p>
												<strong>System Usage: </strong>When you create albums, we store the digitals 
												images you give us, the album descriptions and other information you enter to 
												customize your albums. We also log certain usage information on our servers as 
												you create and manage your photos and video.
											</p>
											<p>
												<strong>Technical Support: </strong>
											When you request support we collect information about the nature of your 
											problem and we may log additional information about system usage to try to help 
											you.</p><p></p>
										</li><li>
											<a name="how-used"><strong>How is the information that Phanfare collects used?</strong></a>
											We use the system usage information and logged diagnostic information to 
											improve our service. For example, we may look at how often a particular feature 
											is used to determine whether or not to improve the feature or a different 
											feature. We use logged diagnostic information to fix bugs and track down 
											problems. In the course of customer support, we may look at system logs to try 
											to understand what you were doing when you had a problem.<p>
												We also look at aggregate demographic information to try to understand who are 
												customers are and to guide product development.</p>
											<p>We do not send out marketing email to sell you third party products and we do 
												not accept any advertising.</p>
										</li><li>
											<a name="sharing"><strong>Does Phanfare share my member account information? </strong>
											</a>We do not share your member account information with third parties except 
											as described here.
											<p></p>
											<p>
												<strong>Agents: </strong>We employ agents who provide various services to us 
												and are subject to non-disclosure agreements. In the course of their work for 
												us, such agents may have access to your account information. Examples of 
												possible services for which we might employ agents (not all of which we employ 
												today) would be: sending out postal mail, billing your credit card, or taking 
												care of our computer servers.
											</p>
											<p>
											</p><p><b>Business Partners:</b> Phanfare may disclose your personal information to 
												business partners, but only after you consent. For example, to provide prints 
												of pictures, we will need to send the digital images to a printing service 
												along with your account information (we don't make prints ourselves). We try to 
												choose companies with privacy policies similar to ours. Nevertheless, our 
												business partners have separate privacy and data collection practices. Phanfare 
												has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more 
												information regarding the partner or service and their privacy policies, return 
												to that partner's home page and click on their Privacy Policy link.
											</p>
											<p>
												<b>If Phanfare is Acquired: </b>Additionally, Phanfare may disclose your 
												personal information to a third party who is a successor in interest, in the 
												event of a merger, reorganization, change of control, acquisition or sale of 
												all or substantially all of Phanfare's assets. But we will tell you if that is 
												going to happen and give you the opportunity to quit before it does.</p>
											<p><b>Legally Compelled Disclosure:</b> Phanfare may disclose your account 
												information when we believe that the law requires it or for the protection of 
												our legal rights. If we believe that you are violating our terms of service, we 
												may disclose your personal information to investigate. We can disclose any 
												personal information about you to law enforcement or other government officials 
												as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection 
												with a violation of the Phanfare Member Agreement, an investigation of fraud, 
												intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may 
												expose us to legal liability.
											</p>
											<p></p>
										</li><li>
											<a name="sharing-email"><strong>Does Phanfare share my email address for email 
													marketing?</strong></a> No, we do not. We hate spam and we guess so do 
											you. Your email address is never sold or otherwise shared with other companies 
											for email marketing.
											<p></p>
										</li><li>
											<a name="spam"><strong>If am Phanfare member, will I receive spam email?</strong></a>
											The spammers won't get your email from us. Phanfare is a subscription service, 
											not paid for by advertising or marketing to our customers. We do not share your 
											email with third parties. We do send out a newsletter to keep our members aware 
											of features improvements and news about the company. You can opt out of that 
											newsletter if you like. We still reserve the right to contact you about billing 
											problems, changes in our member agreement and other official Phanfare 
											communications.
											<p></p>
										</li><li>
											<a name="friends-n-family"><strong> Does Phanfare contact, market to or advertise 
													to the people who view my online albums?</strong></a> Absolutely not. 
											We consider the people who view your albums to be your relationships, not ours. 
											We don't contact your friends, try to sell them on the service, require them to 
											sign up for service to view your pictures, or otherwise co-opt your 
											relationships. In fact, since the Phanfare name does not appear on your albums, 
											if you use a custom URL to serve your pictures, your friends would have no easy 
											way of knowing how you put your pictures online. They are your pictures, your 
											private albums.
											<p>
											But just because we don't tell your friends how you created great looking photo and video 
											albums online does not mean you can't. We hope you will tell your friends about 
											our service and encourage them to join. And we may, from time to time, offer 
											referral bonuses to our members who refer new people who become paying members.</p><p>Also, 
												if a person who views your albums happens to be a Phanfare member already, then 
												they are subject to this privacy policy.</p>
											<p></p>
										</li><li>
											<a name="spyware"></a><strong>Does Phanfare collect any information about my 
												interactions with my personal computer when I run the Phanfare 
												application? </strong>We do not collect other information about your use of 
											your own computer. Phanfare software makes no attempt to track the 
											overall usage of your computer. The sole reason that Phanfare software is 
											a download, versus a purely over-the-web experience is that we can provide a 
											faster, more efficient and more responsive system for managing your online 
											photo and video albums by running locally on your computer.
											<p></p>
										</li><li>
											<a name="quitting"></a><strong>How do I deactivate my Phanfare account and do you 
												purge your records of my information? </strong>If you want to leave the 
											service, email the support team at
											<a href="mailto:support@phanfare.com">support@phanfare.com</a>. 
											Once you leave we purge your information from our servers within a few weeks. 
											But, your information will continue to exist in our computer server backup 
											tapes until those tapes are re-used.
											<p></p>
										</li><li>
											<a name="opt-out"></a><strong>How do I opt out of receiving communications from 
												Phanfare?</strong> The only types of communications you will receive from 
											us are the newsletter and official emails that enable the service (for example, 
											we might send you email when your account is nearing a limit or if your credit 
											were to be denied). You can't opt out of official emails. You can opt out of 
											our newsletter if you like. Send mail to our support team to do that 
											(Automating opting out is on the list.).
											<p></p>
										</li><li>
											<a name="changes"></a><strong>How will Phanfare make me aware of changes to this 
												Privacy Policy?</strong> We will send you email and make changes to this 
											web page.
											<p></p>
										</li><li>
											<a name="security"></a><strong>How does Phanfare secure my personal information?</strong>
											Our computer servers are housed in secure facilities with 24 hour supervision. 
											We employ industry standard encryption and firewall software. We encrypt 
											registration passwords and have policies and procedures for ensuring that your 
											information is not compromised.
										</li>
									</ol>
									<h3>Privacy Policy For Phanfare Guests</h3>
									<p>This policy applies only to <em>guests, </em>those who are not Phanfare registered users, 
										visiting the Phanfare website, including when viewing photo and video albums created by 
										Phanfare registered users.</p>
										<p>We consider the people who view albums to be the relationships of our customers, not our relationship. Hence,
										we do not market our services to album viewers, show album viewers advertisements or attempt to directly solicit viewers to buy the Phanfare
										service while they are viewing user albums. We collect very little information on who people view albums. We do use 
										browser cookies to implement our password protection. We do keep logs of access, but those logs are anonymous.
										</p>
								
									<p><!-- "Data Collection" section of privacy policy --></p>
									<p><strong>Data Collection</strong></p>

									</p>

									<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
									<p>We use browser cookies. Cookies are a technology which can be used to provide you with tailored 
										information from a Website. A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can
