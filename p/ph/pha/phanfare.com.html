                    <p class="subtitle">
                        Introduction</p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Phanfare’s purpose is to enable its customers to archive and share photos and videos.
                        We consider the photos, videos and other meta data to be the private information
                        of our customers. We provide tools and the Phanfare service to enable our customers
                        to share and archive photos, videos and other meta data on Phanfare websites.</p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Our primary responsiblity is to our customers, who in turn have relationships with
                        their viewers. This privacy policy covers both our customers and the viewers of
                        our customer’s photos, videos and other information.</p>
                    <p class="subtitle">
                        Information for Phanfare Customers</p>
                    <p class="description">
                        You are in control of your Phanfare website and control how much security to impose.
                        You decide which albums to publish and what photos and videos to include. You decide
                        whether your Phanfare site is open to the public or locked down with a password.
                        Phanfare’s role is to enable you to publish your photos and videos, store your photos
                        and videos reliably and securely, and enable you to collect comments and other data
                        from your viewers.</p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Phanfare will not solicit your viewers or attempt to contact your viewers unless
                        your viewers independently sign up for the Phanfare service. Some Phanfare pages
                        do include links leading back to Phanfare’s corporate pages and hence a viewer may
                        become a Phanfare customer by following a link found on your page.</p>
                    <p class="subtitle">
                        Information for Viewers</p>
                    <p class="description">
                        If you view a Phanfare website controlled by one of our customers, we may collect
                        certain information from you as described below in this privacy policy. Each Phanfare
                        customer also has access to some data we collect. For example, Phanfare customers
                        have access to visitor reports and logs of comments left by viewers.</p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Phanfare does not control what its customers do with the data we share. Phanfare
                        expects and requires its customers to abide by Phanfare’s terms of service and if
                        we become aware that a Phanfare customer is violating our terms of service than
                        we will terminate the customer’s account.</p>

                        No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on Phanfare. In the

                        When you register with Phanfare, you create your own profile and privacy settings.
                        Your profile information, as well as your name, email and photo, are displayed to
                        people in the relationships specified in your privacy settings to enable you to
                        connect with people on Phanfare. We may occasionally use your name and email address
                        to send you notifications regarding new services offered by Phanfare that we think
                        you may find valuable.

                        Profile information is used by Phanfare primarily to be presented back to and edited
                        by you when you access the service and to be presented to others permitted to view
                        that information by your privacy settings. In some cases where your privacy settings
                        permit it (e.g., posting comments to your albums), other Phanfare users may be able
                        to supplement your albums.

                    <p class="description">
                        Profile information you submit to Phanfare such as your name and the name of recently
                        posted albums will be available to users of Phanfare who belong to at least one
                        of the relationships you allow to access the information through your privacy settings
                        (e.g., friends of friends). Phanfare users who see your name and the name of recent
                        albums in this context, however, will not be able to access your profile information,
                        albums or your User Content unless they have a relationship with you (friend or
                        family) that allows such access based on your privacy settings.

                        Phanfare may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the
                        general operation of the service. For instance, if a friend sends you a new album
                        notification message or someone posts comments on your album, you may receive an
                        email alerting you to that fact.

                        System usage information and logged diagnostic information is used by Phanfare to
                        improve our service. For example, we may look at how often a particular feature
                        is used to determine whether or not to improve the feature or a different feature.
                        We use logged diagnostic information to fix bugs and track down problems. In the
                        course of customer support, we may look at system logs to try to understand what
                        you were doing when you had a problem.

                        Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</p>

                        Phanfare enables sharing photos and videos with both authenticated and anonymous
                        viewers over the Internet, while providing you with privacy settings that restrict
                        other users from accessing your information. We allow you to choose the information
                        you provide to friends and family relationships through Phanfare. Our network architecture
                        and your privacy settings allow you to make informed choices about who has access
                        to your information. We do not provide contact information to third party marketers
                        without your permission. We do not share, sell, or rent your email address to third
                        parties. We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances
                        where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2)
                        legally required or, 3) permitted by you. For example:

                        <li>Your news feed may aggregate the information you provide and make it available to

                            your preferences for your news feed in your Phanfare privacy settings off your Phanfare
                            home page.</li>
                        <li>Phanfare offers user controls to block access to open site information by third
                            party search engine "crawlers" (e.g. Google, Yahoo, etc.). Generally, search engines
                            respect markup on pages that directs search engines to exclude the site content,
                            but respecting such conventions is voluntary on the part of the search engines.</li>
                        <li>We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services
                            we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such
                            as to host the service at a co-location or other facility for servers, to send out
                            email updates about Phanfare, to process and fulfill print and photo merchandise
                            orders, to remove repetitive information from our user lists or to process payments
                            for products or services. In connection with these offerings and business operations,
                            our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a
                            limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third
                            parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable
                            contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the
                            Phanfare-specified purposes. </li>
                        <li>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such
                            as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal
                            information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law
                            enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally,
                            we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply
                            with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal
                            activity perpetrated through the Phanfare service or using the Phanfare name, or
                            to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other
                            companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies. </li>
                        <li>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Phanfare business were to change,
                            your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue
                            operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain
