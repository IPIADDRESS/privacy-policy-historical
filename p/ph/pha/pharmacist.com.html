    <b>I.	Introduction</b>
<br><br>
The American Pharmacists Association (APhA) and the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP), the owners and operators of pharmacist.com, respect your privacy as a user of this Web site. Please read this Privacy Policy so that you can understand what information is collected on pharmacist.com, how that information is used, with whom it is shared, and how it is protected against unauthorized access. To make this notice easy to locate, we make it available on our home page and throughout the site. 
<br><br>
Note that this Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. You should check it regularly to make certain that you are kept up to date. Questions about this Privacy Policy should be directed to: <a href="mailto:feedback@pharmacist.com">feedback@pharmacist.com</a>
<br><br>

<b>II.	Who collects information through pharmacist.com?</b>
<br><br>
Pharmacist.com was developed, and is owned and operated jointly, by the American Pharmacists Association, which is the national professional society of pharmacists in the United States, and the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, which is the association whose membership consists of the Boards of Pharmacy of all 50 United States as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, New Zealand, eight Canadian Provinces, and four Australian states. For additional information about APhA or NABP, see the "About Us" section of pharmacist.com.
<br><br>

<b>III.	What information is collected on pharmacist.com? </b>
<br><br>
This section of the Privacy Policy describes the types of information collected on pharmacist.com. The information collected on pharmacist.com falls into two categories: (1) information that you provide when you engage in transactions on the site, register for the site, or enroll as an APhA member, and (2) information gathered about how you navigate pharmacist.com.
<br><br>
Information that you provide when engaging in transactions on the site, registering for the site, or enrolling as an APhA member includes the following:
<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Primary mailing address</li>
  <li>Primary telephone number</li>
  <li>Primary fax number</li>
  <li>E-mail address</li>
</ul>
Additional demographic information such as practice setting, job function, and license number is requested, but not required.
<br><br>
You may also provide, at your option, a secondary address, telephone number, or fax number. For example, you may provide your home address, telephone, and fax numbers as your primary contact information and a business address, telephone, and fax number as your secondary contact information.
<br><br>
In order to take continuing education (CE) exams on pharmacist.com, you will also be required to provide your Social Security Number for tracking purposes.
<br><br>
If you decide to enroll as an APhA member on the site, you will also be asked for the college(s) of pharmacy or other educational institutions from which you have earned degrees, your date(s) of graduation, and the APhA Academy and Section you wish to join. APhA members may also elect to join one or more Practitioner Interest Groups and to receive certain e-newsletters that are provided as a benefit of membership. APhA members may opt in or out of APhA e-newsletters by updating their profiles on pharmacist.com. After logging into the site, click on "My Account" then "Edit my Preferences." 
<br><br>
When you place an order on pharmacist.com, we may also collect information you provide about someone else to whom you wish to ship products. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
<br><br>
Pharmacist.com receives and stores certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Pharmacist.com may collect and log your IP address and your browser information to determine how to facilitate services online and administer the site. We may collect information on pages visited, frequency of visits, and length of time spent to make improvements that will enhance your experience with us. We also use "cookies" and collect passwords to facilitate your navigation through our site. Cookies are small files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. You can easily adjust your browser settings to prevent cookie data from being stored on your computer; however certain site functions may not operate if you do so. We do not allow third parties to use cookies on pharmacist.com.
<br><br>

<b>IV.	How is the information you provide on pharmacist.com used?</b>
<br><br>
This section of the Privacy Policy describes how the information that you provide on pharmacist.com is used. The information you provide is used for four purposes: (1) to control access to the Web site (2) to provide the products or services you purchase through pharmacist.com, (3) to contact you about APhA or NABP activities, and (4) to understand how you interact with the Web site so that the site may be improved to better meet your needs.
<br><br>
In addition, the name, address, e-mail, telephone, and fax numbers you provide on pharmacist.com may be used to send you APhA periodicals, resource catalogs, information on programs such as the APhA Annual Meeting, the NABP Annual Meeting, educational programs, and announcements from APhA or NABP, and, for APhA members, e-newsletters and ballots for APhA elections.
<br><br>
We may also conduct occasional voluntary surveys of pharmacist.com users (for example mailing or e-mailing you a questionnaire).
<br><br>

<b>V.	With whom is the information you provide on pharmacist.com shared?</b>
<br><br>
This section of the Privacy Policy describes how the information you provide on pharmacist.com may be shared with parties other than APhA or NABP and how you may control such information sharing. There are four ways in which information that you provide on pharmacist.com may be shared: (1) with agents of APhA or NABP who are performing Web services, data entry, customer service, or product fulfillment tasks under contract, (2) with organizations seeking to contact you about pharmacy-related news, professional information, or educational resources, (3) with research organizations, and (4) with a select few organizations offering professional services to pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, or pharmacy students. With the exception of (1), pharmacist.com offers you the option not to have your information shared.
<br><br>
Name and address, telephone or fax number, e-mail address, and credit card information may be provided to third parties operating under contract to APhA or NABP for such purposes as fulfilling product orders, handling meeting registrations, or providing CE exam grading services. Contract terms specifically forbid these third parties from making any other use of your information. These third parties are selected and monitored by either APhA or NABP, as are the arrangements that the third parties make to secure your information against unauthorized use. Credit card information provided on pharmacist.com is not permanently stored by APhA, NABP, or the third parties that perform the functions listed in this paragraph.
<br><br>
Name and address information collected on pharmacist.com may be made available for limited, one-time use by organizations seeking to contact you with information about products, programs, or services relevant to the professional or educational needs of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, or pharmacy students. E-mail addresses are not made available to any such third party. Requests for such use of your address information are reviewed to ensure that the information that is to be provided is consistent with the professional nature of APhA and/or NABP and the professional and educational needs of the pharmacy community. You may specify that your name and address information not be used for the purposes enumerated in this paragraph by sending an e-mail with the subject "no informational mailings" to <a href="mailto:feedback@pharmacist.com">feedback@pharmacist.com</a>. 
<br><br>
APhA and/or NABP may provide name and address, telephone, or e-mail information collected on pharmacist.com to research firms operating under contract to either or both organizations, to researchers at colleges of pharmacy or other recognized educational, or to research organizations seeking to conduct studies on pharmacy practice, education, or training on a voluntary basis (that is, you may be asked but never required to participate in such studies). Such organizations will be permitted to use personally identifiable information only to contact you regarding the study. You may specify that your name and address information not be used for the purposes enumerated in this paragraph by sending an e-mail with the subject "no surveys" to <a href="mailto:feedback@pharmacist.com">feedback@pharmacist.com</a>. 
<br><br>
Name and address information collected on pharmacist.com may be made available to a small number of providers of professional liability or other insurance products, credit card, banking, or investment services, telephone discount, or automobile rental companies for the purpose of sending you mail about their products, programs, and services. You may specify that your name and address information not be used for the purposes enumerated in this paragraph by sending an e-mail with the subject "no offers" to <a href="mailto:feedback@pharmacist.com">feedback@pharmacist.com</a>. 
<br><br>
Pharmacist.com may disclose personally identifiable information in special cases if we find it necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the policies of pharmacist.com or causing injury to or interference with pharmacist.com, its users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Pharmacist.com also may disclose personally identifiable information as is required or appropriate in order to comply with the law.
<br><br>

<b>VI.	How we protect the information you provide on pharmacist.com</b>
<br><br>
This section of the Privacy Policy explains how the information that you provide when you register for pharmacist.com, conduct transactions on pharmacist.com, or enroll as an APhA member is protected against unauthorized use.
<br><br>
We will undertake procedures to help to ensure that the information you provide to us is protected against loss, misuse, alteration, destruction, or unauthorized access. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online,
<br><br>
The information stored in your profile and CE Center account is protected by the user name and password that you were provided when your pharmacist.com account was created. You may change your user name and password at any time by logging onto pharmacist.com, clicking "My Account" then "Change Password." You are encouraged to change passwords periodically and to protect your user name and password as you would other personally sensitive information.
<br><br>
Whenever you are finished using the pharmacist.com site, you are encouraged to log out by clicking the "log out" button located on the home page and most other pages within the site. To prevent others from accessing your personal account information, it is particularly important to log out if you are using a shared or publicly accessible computer.
<br><br>
All information that you provide on pharmacist.com is stored in a database residing on servers that are secured against unauthorized access both by physical and software means. Physical access to the servers is tightly controlled. Access to your information by employees of APhA, NABP, and third parties working on pharmacist.com or providing services under contract to APhA and/or NABP is on a "need to know" basis, in which access is permitted only for specific jobs or job functions (for example, billing clerks or customer service representatives). 
<br><br>
Credit card and other personal information that you provide on pharmacist.com is transmitted over the Internet using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connection. SSL is the industry-standard method for protecting confidential Web communications, such as credit card numbers, online forms, and financial data, from interception and hacking. 
<br><br>
APhA and NABP take commercially reasonable steps to secure the information collected on pharmacist.com. In addition, you can do your part to protect the information collected on pharmacist.com about you by securing your pharmacist.com user name and password, as described above, and by logging out when you finish using the site. However, you should be aware that despite the security procedures that APhA and NABP employ, no security system is impenetrable nor can we guarantee that the information you provide will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet. You should particularly note that although it is illegal to intercept or disclose these messages under Federal law, Internet e-mail is not secure, so you should not send confidential or personally sensitive information via e-mail.
<br><br>

<b>VII.	How you can change information that you provide on pharmacist.com</b>
<br><br>
Pharmacist.com provides users with 24-hour access to their personal information after it has been collected. You can access all of your personally identifiable information that we collect online (your "profile") and maintain it by logging into the site and clicking on "Update my Account." You may also send changes to pharmacist.com, Customer Services Department, 2215 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC, 20037. To further protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to make corrections. When you update information, we usually keep a record of the prior version for our records.
<br><br>
<b>VIII. Anonymous browsing</b>
<br><br>
You are also given the option of visiting pharmacist.com without offering any information about yourself. Please note that you will not be able to purchase certain products or visit certain areas of the site as an anonymous browser.
<br><br>
<b>IX. Acceptance of Privacy Policy by user</b>
<br><br>
The use of this site and submission of personal data to pharmacist.com constitute the User's acknowledgement that he or she has read, understood, and accepted this Privacy Policy, and agrees to its terms.
<br><br>
Pharmacist.com reserves the right to modify or supplement this Privacy Policy statement at any time. If we make a material change, we will post a notice on our home page with a link to the updated Privacy Policy. Please read any such notice and the new Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after we post such notice will constitute your acceptance of the new terms and their application to your use of this Web site and the information disclosed for such use, including information previously furnished to us, as if they were the original terms.
<br><br>
Pharmacist.com contains links to other Web sites. Pharmacist.com has no control over, and is not responsible for, the privacy policies or content of these sites.
