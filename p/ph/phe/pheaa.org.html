</ul>
<p><a name="1"></a><b>PHEAA's Commitment To Privacy Protection For Users Of Its 
  Website</b></p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA)<sup>1</sup>, is 
  committed to preserving the individual privacy rights of all of the users of 
  its websites. PHEAA strongly believes that it has a responsibility to protect 
  from disclosure to unauthorized parties the personally identifying information 
  (name, address, date of birth, social security number, etc.) of its website 
  users. Therefore, PHEAA has adopted and implemented a privacy policy to protect 
  the individually identifying account and personal information of its website 
  users.</p>
<p><a href="#m">Back to Privacy Policy Menu</a></p>
<p><a name="2"></a><b>Notice and Disclosure</b></p>
<p><b>PHEAA will not sell, trade, nor disclose the personally identifying information 
  of its website users to any unauthorized third parties.</b> Because of the many 
  different relationships PHEAA has with the users of its websites<sup>2</sup>, 
  it is possible that disclosure of information provided by website users might 
  be required in the delivery of PHEAA's services to users in the following circumstances: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li> When users have authorized the disclosure of information through certifications 
    on loan applications and promissory notes, the Free Application for Federal 
    Student Aid (FAFSA), and documents held by PHEAA and its partners such as 
    schools, lenders, servicers, United States Department of Education, and guarantors 
    of users' financial aid. </li><p>
  </p><li>When PHEAA needs to share user information to provide services a user has 
    requested. </li><p>
  </p><li>When PHEAA needs to provide the information to its business partners that 
    perform services for users. </li><p>
  </p><li>When PHEAA is required by law to disclose user information by order of court, 
    pursuant to state, local, federal, or international statute, regulation or 
    mandate, and in cooperation with law enforcement agencies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, PHEAA may use information provided by users for the following 
  internal purposes: providing services to users, complying with local, state, 
  or federal financial aid statutes and regulations, ensuring accurate contact 
  and billing information for users, and analyzing the efficiency of its websites.</p>
<p> Under PHEAA's administration of both the Pennsylvania State Higher Educational 
  Assistance Grant Program and the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), 
  PHEAA requires the disclosure of Social Security numbers by applicants for Pennsylvania 
  State Grants and loans under FFELP. The primary use of this information is to 
  verify user identity, to determine user program eligibility and benefits, to 
  permit the servicing of user financial aid, to certify user attendance and status 
  at an approved higher educational institution, and in the event necessary, to 
  locate users. The disclosure of a user's Social Security number by a user is 
  mandatory for the user to participate in both Pennsylvania's Higher Educational 
  Assistance Grant Program and the FFELP. </p>
<p>PHEAA has required the disclosure of applicants' Social Security numbers under 
  state statute and regulations prior to January 1, 1975 in order to verify the 
  identity of State Grant applicants and recipients. Similarly, the United States 
  Department of Education has for several years required the disclosure of individuals' 
  Social Security numbers on applications and other FFELP requisite documents 
  pursuant to published regulations.</p>
<p>PHEAA uses "cookies" to enhance its website users' experiences on the PHEAA 
  Website. A cookie is a small file that PHEAA transfers to users' computer hard 
  drives. PHEAA's use of cookies enables its website users to avoid the nuisance 
  of being asked to provide the same information repeatedly while users move from 
  page to page of the site. Cookies also allow PHEAA to ensure that only the user's 
  web browser may exchange information regarding the user's account with PHEAA's 
  servers. Most web browsers are initially set to accept cookies. Additionally, 
  some web browsers may be set to prompt users before it accepts a cookie. Many 
  of the services offered on the PHEAA Website might not function properly when 
  users' set their web browsers to reject cookies.</p>
<p>Users should be aware that other websites to which a user links from PHEAA's 
  websites may contain privacy policies, statements, promises, or provisions that 
  differ from PHEAA's Website Privacy Policy and as such users are encouraged 
  to review the applicable privacy policy of any site other than the PHEAA websites. 
  Users are encouraged to fully review the privacy statements of other websites 
  to determine whether or not the user's use of the site comports with the user's 
  desire to maintain the privacy of his/her personally identifying information.</p>
<p><b>PHEAA will not knowingly collect or retain information submitted to it by 
  children under the age of thirteen. If PHEAA learns that it unknowingly collected 
  personally identifying information from children under 13 years of age, it will 
  immediately take all reasonable measures to delete the information from its 
  computer systems. </b></p>
<p>PHEAA will closely monitor and restrict its employees' access to user account 
  and personal information to only instances of business necessity.</p>
<p><a href="#m">Back to Privacy Policy Menu</a></p>
<p><a name="3"></a><b>Choice And Consent</b></p>
<p>PHEAA provides users access on its websites to users' individual account, eligibility 
  for financial aid status, and much more personal user level information. PHEAA 
  fully understands and wishes to fully serve its website users that do not desire 
  to have personally identifying account and status information available on PHEAA's 
  websites. Users may request the deletion of their PHEAA account information 
  available to them on PHEAA's websites by sending an email to <a href="mail%20to:%20slsccs@pheaa.org">slsccs@pheaa.org</a> 
  or call 1-800-233-0557 extension 4500. Upon receipt of an email from a user, 
  PHEAA will remove the user's account information from its websites but will 
  continue to retain all of the information on its computer systems as required 
  by state and federal laws and regulations governing financial aid. </p>
<p>Unless specifically notified by the user, PHEAA will operate as though the 
  user consents to the user's account information being available on its websites. 
  Please review the sections on data security and PHEAA's privacy commitment for 
  explanations of the security utilized by PHEAA in protecting personal account 
  information from unauthorized disclosure. </p>
<p><a href="#m">Back to Privacy Policy Menu</a></p>
<p><a name="4"></a><b>Data Quality And Access</b> </p>
<p>PHEAA will take all reasonable steps to assure that information about users 
  is accurate, complete, and timely for the purposes for which it is intended 
  to be used. PHEAA will take every measure to establish appropriate processes 
  or mechanisms so that inaccuracies or errors in users' information may be timely 
  corrected by the user. PHEAA will try to make these processes and mechanisms 
  as simple and easy to use as possible while providing assurances that the erroneous 
  and inaccurate information has been timely corrected. The information contained 
  on PHEAA's websites is subject to change without prior advance notice. </p>
<p>When users browse PHEAA's websites and have not registered as a user for any 
  of PHEAA's online services, the browsing is anonymous. Anonymous browsing includes 
  reading pages and downloading certain information. Personal information such 
  as name, address, phone number, and email address are not collected from anonymous 
  browsers.</p>
<p><a href="#m">Back to Privacy Policy Menu</a></p>
<p><a name="5"></a><b>Data Security</b></p>
<p>Securing users' personal information is very important to PHEAA. Therefore, 
  PHEAA has implemented several security measures to protect users' personally 
  identifying information from loss, misuse, or alteration.</p>
<p>When users send confidential personal information to PHEAA via a PHEAA website, 
  PHEAA requires that a secure session first be established using Secure Socket 
  Layer (SSL) technology. During a secure SSL session, data passed back and forth 
  between the user's computer and PHEAA's servers is secured through the use of 
  public key cryptography. The user's computer exchanges key information with 
  PHEAA computers to create a private conversation that only the user's computer 
  and PHEAA systems may understand. To benefit from SSL technology, users must 
  use a browser with SSL capabilities. </p>
<p>Please note that while using PHEAA's websites, users will be notified when 
  entering a secure session and when leaving a secure session, unless the setting 
  is turned off on the user's browser. After leaving a secure session any information 
  transmitted to PHEAA is not secure. </p>
<p>For security purposes, PHEAA uses special software programs to monitor traffic 
  on its websites and to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, 
  or otherwise to cause damage to PHEAA's websites. These programs do not collect 
  personally identifying information about you but they do collect information 
  that will enable PHEAA to identify someone attempting to tamper with its websites. 
  PHEAA has a zero tolerance policy for the misuse, misappropriation, unauthorized 
  access, tampering, damage, destruction, or unlawful utilization of its websites 
  and computer systems and will seek the maximum enforcement of state, federal, 
  and international criminal laws against any individual engaging in such activity. 
  Additionally, PHEAA will seek the maximum amount of civil damages available 
  under the law in such instances of the unauthorized misuse of its websites and 
  computer systems. </p>
<p>Please note that when a user sends electronic mail messages (e-mail) to PHEAA, 
  AES, SLSC, or GLC, the user's message will usually contain the user's return 
  email address. Thus, PHEAA may utilize a user's e-mail address in responding 
  to a user's inquiry and the content of the user's e-mail in formulating a response. 
  PHEAA will permanently record and store any substantive e-mail received from 
  users. E-mail is not a secure means of transmitting information. </p>
<p><a href="#m">Back to Privacy Policy Menu</a></p>
<p><a name="6"></a><b>Changes To PHEAA's Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p>PHEAA's Website Privacy Policy may be modified when necessary to conform to 
  federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations, and at other 
  times to conform with technological changes, court decisions and changes in 
  agency policy. Changes to PHEAA's Website Privacy Policy will be notated here 
  when made so that you may be fully informed about the privacy protections afforded 
  to you by PHEAA enabling you to make an informed decision concerning your use 
  of PHEAA's websites. It is recommended that you check PHEAA's Website Privacy 
  Policy each time that you visit PHEAA's websites. </p>
