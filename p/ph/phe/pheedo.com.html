            <p><strong><font size="2">Personally Identifiable Client Data</font></strong> 
        <font size="2"><br>
        Pheedo, Inc. collects personally identifiable information from all websites 
        (and specifically their owners) wishing to join our network. The collection 
        of this information is a part of normal business practices. Clients wishing 
        to join the Pheedo, Inc. advertising network will be asked to provide 
        personally identifiable data through the host sign up and registration 
        process at our web site. Examples of personally identifiable data that 
        may be requested include name, address, phone number, e-mail address, 
        and social security number, tax ID number, etc. Pheedo, Inc. will never 
        request or collect data from a client on subject areas including sexual 
        orientation, political or religious affiliations, or medical data. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Pheedo, Inc. does not use any personally identifiable 
        data about a client for profiling purposes. All personally identifiable 
        information that Pheedo, Inc. collects from clients is principally intended 
        for administrative needs (e.g., accounting and pay-out), for which purpose 
        such data are required. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Periodically Pheedo, Inc. may desire to communicate with 
        our network of hosts via email newsletters or other avenues to offer strategic 
        marketing information and other communications to assist in business related 
        activities. In such instances Pheedo, Inc. will access clients' personally 
        identifiable information. In the event that a client of Pheedo, Inc. wishes 
        not to have their personally identifiable information used for the aforementioned 
        purposes, those clients can elect to opt-out from future communications. 
        For more information on opting-out please see the "Client Choice Concerning 
        Data Collection" section below. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">All personally identifiable data provided by individual 
        clients will be kept in strict confidence by Pheedo, Inc. and will be 
        treated with the same level of respect and care that Pheedo, Inc. treats 
        its other proprietary information and trade secrets. Pheedo, Inc. will 
        never sell, rent, exchange or barter any personally identifiable client 
        information to or with any third party for financial gain or marketing 
        purposes. Pheedo, Inc. may, from time to time, provide such information 
        to certain third-party administrative vendors for efficiency purposes 
        in providing administrative services such as billing, delivery and payouts. 
        Any third-party vendor so used, will be required to enter into a confidentiality 
        and non-disclosure agreement with Pheedo, Inc. in accordance with the 
        policies stated here. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>Personally Identifiable Client Data - Opt-Out</strong> 
        <br>
        Because Pheedo, Inc. is a strong proponent of online privacy we are committed 
        to making sure that clear notice and choice is provided to all clients 
        before any personally identifiable data are used for any purposes other 
        than for what was originally intended. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">When a client joins Pheedo, Inc.'s network and registers 
        for Pheedo, Inc.'s services, personally identifiable information is required 
        as a part of doing business. Pheedo, Inc.'s primary intent in collecting 
        personally identifiable information is for use in administrative purposes 
        including accounting and payouts. However, Pheedo, Inc. may periodically 
        use personally identifiable information for marketing and communication 
        purposes targeted to our clients. Clients wishing not to receive such 
        communications from Pheedo, Inc. may do so by "opting-out" during the 
        registration and application procedure process. A client may change their 
        "opt" status at anytime during their tenure with Pheedo, Inc. by accessing 
        their online account.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>"Cookies"</strong> When a Pheedo Client logs in 
        to the Pheedo reporting systems, a "cookie" is placed within their computer. 
        A "cookie" is a unique tag that is issued to the Client and is used to 
        identify individual computers. The purpose of the cookie is to allow Pheedo 
        to validate the identity of the Client and maintain the security and privacy 
        of the Client's account data. This cookie is required to log into Pheedo's 
        reporting systems and there is no method to opt out of this cookie. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>Security Precautions</strong> <br>
        Pheedo, Inc. makes every effort to maintain the security of its network 
        and the data we collect. Any data that is stored on Pheedo, Inc.'s server 
        is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the 
        public. Pheedo, Inc. has a strict internal security policy with respect 
        to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only 
        to those employees or third parties who have a need to know such information 
        for the purpose of effectively delivering Pheedo, Inc. products and services. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>Access to Data<br>
        </strong>Pheedo, Inc. allows clients who have provided personally identifiable 
        data, access their data to ensure that it is correct and to make any changes 
        at anytime through their Pheedo customer online account. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>Pheedo and Client Website Privacy Policy Statements</strong> 
        <br>
        Pheedo, Inc. encourages all websites within our network create privacy 
        policy statements and provide Internet consumers with conspicuous access 
        to their statements. Additionally, Pheedo, Inc. requests that all website 
        publishers doing business with Pheedo, Inc. disclose any and all information 
        that is being collected from Internet consumers on their website, including 
        data gathered from banners and other forms of advertising being served 
        on their website. Finally, Pheedo, Inc. encourages the websites in our 
        network to provide links to all advertisers gathering information from 
        Internet consumers in their respective privacy statements. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">If you have particular concerns about any website advertising 
        with Pheedo, Inc. with respect to privacy issues, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@pheedo.com">privacy@pheedo.com</a>. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>Children's Privacy<br>
        </strong>As of April 21, 2000 the children's Online Privacy Protection 
        Act became effective. The regulations apply to the online collection of 
        personal information from children under the age of 13. Pheedo, Inc. is 
        very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and makes every effort 
        to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. Pheedo, Inc.'s 
        web site, products, and services are not developed for or directed at 
        children. Our policy is not to permit anyone under the age of 13 to do 
        business with us. If you believe your child has provided Pheedo, Inc. 
        with any personally identifiable data by registering at Pheedo, Inc.'s 
        web site, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@Pheedo.com">privacy@pheedo.com</a> 
        to have them removed. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">We also request that all websites using our advertising 
        network disclose in their privacy statements any and all information regarding 
        the collection of information from children. </font></p>
