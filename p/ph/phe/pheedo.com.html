				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				<hr>
				<h2 class="help">What Personal Information About Customers Does Pheedo Collect?</h2>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> Pheedo collects personal information when you register with Pheedo to use our products or services or when you enter into promotions or sweepstakes. Pheedo also collects information about your transactions with us. When you register or enter into a transaction we ask for information such as your name, email address, billing address, phone number, credit card information, and certain optional information. You may opt not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future services for you, and communicating with you.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Automated Information:</strong> We receive and store certain types of information automatically whenever you interact with us. For instance, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and
				we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses www.pheedo.com. Pheedo automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie, and the page you request.
				Pheedo receives IP addresses from all users because this information is automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page.</li>
				
				<li><strong>E-mail Communications:</strong> To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Pheedo if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to
				lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Information from Other Sources:</strong> Pheedo may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>What About Cookies?</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>Cookies are small text files that your Web browser
				stores on your computer's hard drive. These text files only
				contain information you have already given to us and enable our
				systems to recognize your browser and to provide personalized
				features within Pheedo's services and
				products.</li>
				<li>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you
				how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to
				have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how
				to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take
				full advantage of some of Pheedo's features, and we
				recommend that you leave them turned on.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>How Does Pheedo Use The Information It
				Collects?</h3>
				
				<p>Pheedo uses information for the following general purposes:
				products and services provision, billing, identification and
				authentication, services improvement, customer contact, notifying
				you of new services or products, research, and anonymous
				reporting.</p>
				<h3>Does Pheedo Share the Information It
				Receives?</h3>
				<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our
				business and we are not in the business of selling it to others.
				We share customer information only as described below and with
				subsidiaries Pheedo, Inc. controls that either are subject to
				this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as
				those described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Agents:</strong> We employ other companies and
				individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
				sending e-mail and postal mail, removing repetitive information
				from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing
				assistance, providing search results and links (including paid
				listings and links), processing credit card payments, and
				providing customer service. They have access to personal
				information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it
				for other purposes.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong>As we continue to develop
				our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries or business
				units. In such transactions, customer information generally is
				one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the
				promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of
				course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the event that
				Pheedo, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
				information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
				</li>
				
				
				<li>
				
				<strong>Subscription to RSS Feeds via Email:</strong> Pheedo provides services that enable users to receive updates of our advertiser and publisher partnersâ€™ RSS feeds via email. In order to provide this service Pheedo collects the email addresses of users. Pheedo may share the email addresses with the advertiser and/or publisher partnersâ€™ on whose behalf we deliver the RSS feed content.
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<strong>Protection of Pheedo and Others:</strong> We release
				account and other personal information when we believe release is
				appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of
				Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or
				safety of Pheedo, our users, or others. This includes exchanging
				information with other companies and organizations for fraud
				protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this
				does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise
				disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for
				commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in
				this Privacy Notice.
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Other than as set out
				above, you will receive notice when information about you might
				go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose
				not to share the information.
				</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>What About Aggregate or Non-Personally Identifiable
				Information?</h3>
				<p>Pheedo aggregates (gathers up data across all user accounts)
				personal information and may disclose such information in a
				non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third
				parties for their marketing, promotional, or other business
				purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose any
				information that could be used to identify you personally.
				<em>For example, we may disclose to third parties
				information about how many people used our services in the last
				week, but we will not disclose who those people are.</em>
				Certain information, such as your name, email address, password,
				credit card number, and bank account number, are not disclosed to
				these third parties in a personally identifiable manner without
				your explicit consent.</p>
				<h3>How Secure Is Information About Me?</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>
				We limit access to personal information about you to employees
				who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that
				information to provide products or services to you or in order to
				do their jobs.
				</li>
				<li>
				We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to
				protect personal information about you.
				</li>
				<li>
				
				Your Pheedo Account Information is password-protected.
				</li>
				<li>
				In certain areas, Pheedo uses industry-standard SSL-encryption
				to protect data transmissions.
				</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Which Information Can I Access?</h3>
				<p>Pheedo gives you access to a range of information about your
				account and your interactions with Pheedo for the limited purpose
				of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.</p>
				
				<h3>What Choices Do I Have?</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>
				As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide
				information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or
				to take advantage of such Pheedo features.
				</li>
				
				<li>
				You can add or update certain information on pages such as
				those listed in the "Which Information Can I Access?" section
				above. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the
				prior version for our records.
				</li>
				<li>
				The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you
				how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to
				have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how
				to disable cookies altogether. However, you will not be able to
				use important Pheedo features if you do not use cookies.
				</li>
				<li>
				A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you
				visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to
				provide you with a personalized experience at Pheedo if we cannot
				recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools
				exist.
				</li>
				<li>
				In addition, the Federal Trade Commission provides useful
				information about online privacy on its own Web site, <u><a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee.shtm">Site
				Seeing on the Internet</a></u>.
				</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Children</h3>
				
				<p>Pheedo does not provide its services to children under 13
				years of age.</p>
				<h3>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h3>
				<p>If you choose to visit Pheedo, your visit and any dispute over
				privacy is subject to this Notice and our Terms of Service
				including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and
				application of the law of the state of Oregon. If you have any
				concern about privacy at Pheedo, please contact us with a
				thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.</p>
				<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>
				Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and
				the Terms of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic
				reminders of our notices and conditions but you should check our
				Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated
				otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information
				that we have about you and your account.
				</li>
				<li>
				We will notify you about significant changes in the way we
				treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary
				email address specified in your Pheedo account or by placing a
				prominent notice on our site.
				</li>
				</ul>
