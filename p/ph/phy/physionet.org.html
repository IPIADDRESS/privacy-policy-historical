<p>
<strong>Your privacy is important to us.</strong> We do not collect
personally identifiable information on our web site or otherwise
unless you choose to give it to us via an electronic mail message, a
phone call, or by postal mail. Even when you choose to give us such
information, we keep it confidential.

</p><p>
We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose mailing lists or
other personally identifiable information. We maintain some records of
individuals who contact us so that we may contact you later or provide
further information to you in the future.  We do not provide
this information to anyone else unless you give us your permission.

</p><p>
We do not use "cookies" on our web site.  Our web servers collect
information about dates and times when our web site was accessed,
the IP addresses and host names of the computers that connect to our
site, and the URLs of the web sites from which you linked to our site.
We may use this information in summary form, stripped of personally
identifiable information, to analyze web traffic and to document usage
of this resource to funding agencies.

</p><p>
You may register as a member of PhysioNet if you use PhysioBank data
or PhysioToolkit software, or if you wish to contribute data, software, or
commentary to the PhysioNet web site.  The information you submit with
your registration is entered into the PhysioNet membership database.
The PhysioNet membership database is never sold, rented, lent,
exchanged, or used for anything other than official PhysioNet
activity.  We may elect to send members mailings with information from
other groups, but the mailings will always originate with PhysioNet.

</p><p>
Members may post data, software, and commentary via PhysioNet (once these
services are available), but all such postings are identified by the
member's e-mail address (at a minimum;  you may of course include other
identifying information, such as a PGP signature, if you wish).

</p><p>
Our privacy policy is based on those adopted by <a href="http://www.cpsr.org/" target="other">Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility</a> and by the <a href="http://www.privacyrights.org" target="other">Privacy Rights
Clearinghouse</a>.
