<a name="What_this_Privacy_Policy_doesn.E2.80.99t_cover"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> What this Privacy Policy doesn’t cover  </span></h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to web sites and services that are owned and operated by Physiopedia. Physiopedia does not exercise control over other web sites linked to or from within the Site. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit information from you. You are encouraged to read their privacy policies before you enter into an exchange with them. 
</p><p>Physiopedia may allow other companies to serve advertisements on the Site. These third-party advertisers use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content to a certain audience. 
</p><p>Sponsors or advertisers on the Site may use their own cookies, web beacons or other online tracking technologies in the banner advertisements served on the Site and in emails, special promotions or newsletters we send you. Some advertisers use companies other than Physiopedia to serve their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies (“Ad Servers”) may also collect non-personal information through the use of cookies or web beacons on our web site. In certain situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily directing your browser to the web site of an Ad Server or other third party acting on behalf of the sponsor, partner, or advertiser before re-directing your browser to its selected destination (e.g., back to Physiopedia to show the ad, or to the advertiser's website); this re-direction process will not be apparent to you. We do not control these third parties' use of cookies or web beacons, or how they manage the non-personal information they gather through them. However, we do require sponsors, advertisers and Ad Servers who collect cookie or web beacon information through our web site to agree that they will not collect any personal information from our site without your consent. They have promised us they will not link any non-personal cookie or web beacon information collected by them on our site to personal information they or others collect in other ways or from other sites except as may be described in connection with a particular program. You should review the privacy policy of other sites you visit or link to from our site to understand how these other sites use cookies and how they use the information they collect through the use of cookies or web beacons on their own sites. Certain Ad Servers allow you to prevent them from collecting data through the use of cookies. In order to do so, you must opt-out of such data collection with each individual site. Currently, you can opt-out of cookies for several Ad Servers by visiting the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" rel="nofollow">Network Advertising Initiative gateway Opt-out </a>site. This website will also allow you to review the Ad Server's privacy policies. You can also find additional information and resources about how to opt-out of advertising and related cookies by visiting the <a href="http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/cookieoptout.html" class="external text" title="http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/cookieoptout.html" rel="nofollow">World Privacy Forum's Site</a>. 
</p><p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to Physiopedia by email. If you want to keep content or business information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them in an email to Physiopedia.

<p>You do not need to register for a Physiopedia account in order to visit and use the Site. For these no-registration-required services Physiopedia collects the following information: 
</p><p><b>Cookies:</b> A cookie is a small file containing a unique string of characters that is sent from the Physiopedia servers and saved by your browser software. Browsers are typically set to accept cookies, however, you can change the settings on your browser to notify you when a site is sending a cookie to your browser or, alternatively, to refuse cookies altogether. The Physiopedia Site sets a temporary session cookie on your browser whenever you visit, and you will not be able to log in to your account if you have set your browser to deny the session cookie. This temporary cookie is deleted each time you close your browser session. When you log in, the Physiopedia Site sets another cookie on your browser that remains on your computer up to 30 days so that you don’t have to retype your user name when you return to the Site and log in. You may clear this log in cookie anytime through your browser settings. 
</p><p><b>Log information:</b> When you use the Physiopedia services, our servers automatically record the data that your browser sends whenever you visit a Web site. These “server logs” include data such as browser type, Internet Protocol address, your Web request, the date and time of your requests, and your Physiopedia cookie(s) that uniquely identify your browser. The log data is used primarily for the Web site technicians to monitor the health of the Site and solve any technical problems. The log data can also be used to track down malicious Editors and Members by correlating their IP address to a username. Examples of malicious activity include harassment, duplicate accounts, abuse of the system and disruption of the Physiopedia service. Physiopedia’s policy is not to disclose the log data publicly, but such data may be shared with third parties in the following cases: a) if it is required to comply with compulsory requests from law enforcement, b) if it is required to pursue an investigation of abuse, c) if it is required to resolve technical issues, d) if it is required to help block certain IP addresses to stop abuse, or e) if it is required to protect the safety, property, or rights of Physiopedia, its users, or the public. 
</p><p><b>Clear Gifs Information: When</b> you use the Site, we may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons), which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of users without collecting any personally identifiable information about you. 

E-mail Messages:<b> If you send an email to Physiopedia we may retain those communications and your email address in order to reply to your inquiries, fulfil your requests and to improve our services.<br>We use the non-personal information described above to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your current or subsequent visits to the Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) access your information after you sign in; and (h) market the Site to advertisers and other third parties. </b>

<a name="Editors_.28registration_required.29"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline"> Editors (registration required) </span></h5>
<p>In order to contribute content to the Site you must register as a Physiopedia “Editor.” Physiopedia collects the non-personal information described above from Editors, and in addition, Physiopedia collects the following types of personal information from Editors for the following purposes (personal information is information that personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, home address, phone numbers, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information): Information you provide:<b>When you register to become an Editor, Physiopedia asks you for personal information. Examples of that information include your name (or a pseudonym), email address, birth date, account password, and the profile information described below. We use the personal information that you provide to respond to your questions, provide you the specific services you select, send you emails about Site maintenance and updates, and inform you of significant changes to this Privacy Policy </b> 
</p><p><b>Profile Information:</b> Editors must disclose in their public profiles their corporate and academic affiliations and they must disclose if they receive, or expect to receive, any form of compensation for the content they contribute to Physiopedia, or any compensation related to medicine, medical information, or products and services related to the body. This is standard practice in the medical field and those policies carry over to the Physiopedia community, and are meant to encourage a “neutral point of view” with respect to Physiopedia contributions. 
</p><p><b>Your IP Address:</b> In addition to your profile, you may also be identified in the Physiopedia system by your IP address, the numerical address of the location from which you are connecting to the Site. That IP address may be traceable specifically to your computer, or it may only be traceable to the Internet Service Provider (ISP) you use to access the Internet, depending on what type of connection you have. In either case, Physiopedia will have the ability to link your IP address to your contributions on the site, which helps to prevent abuse and fraud.<br>Contributions: When Editors submit content to the Site, that information becomes publicly available throughout the world via the Site, and each such “post” will be attached to the Editor’s profile. This material will be stored indefinitely and is always publicly viewable. Removing content from a Physiopedia article does not permanently delete that content. The features of the Site permit anyone to retrieve a previous version of an article and see content that was previously deleted. If the article itself is deleted, a copy will permanently remain on the Physiopedia servers and be accessible by Physiopedia personnel. 
</p><p><b>Other Data:</b> In order to maintain an open and transparent community, certain other data on Editors is made public through “user contributions” lists and by other users, typically in aggregated form. Such data might include the times at which an Editor edited content on the Site and the number of edits they made. 
</p><p><b>Email:</b> Other Editors may send email to you through the Physiopedia service, however your email address will not be revealed to them unless you respond, or possibly if their email to you is “bounced” back to them. Physiopedia may use Editors’ email address to communicate with them periodically. If you subscribe to a mailing list for a project, your address will be visible to others on the project. 
</p><p><b>Invitation emails:</b> You may choose to opt-out of Physiopedia invitation emails by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the invitation email. 
</p><p><b>Links:</b> Physiopedia may present links in a format that lets Physiopedia keep track of when these links are clicked. Physiopedia uses this information to improve the quality of Physiopedia services, to estimate traffic Physiopedia sends to third party sites, and to customize content and advertising. 
</p><p><b>Your contacts:</b> In order to invite others to connect with you directly in Physiopedia, you will enter their names and email addresses. This information will be used by Physiopedia to send your invitation including a message that you write. The names and email addresses of people that you invite will be used only to send your invitation and reminders. You may also choose to manually enter or upload data about your contacts on Physiopedia. All information entered as private will only be viewable by you and will not be searchable by others in the Physiopedia network without your permission. All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this privacy policy as cover your own personal information.
