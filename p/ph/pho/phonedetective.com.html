          <p class="wpText">
            <strong>With Our Parent Company:</strong> Inflection.com, Inc. owns a variety of products and services in addition to this site, including Identity.com, GoodHire.com, PeopleSmart.com, and other people search sites.

				</p>
          <p class="wpText">
            <strong>Deidentified and Aggregated Data:</strong> We may share or disclose information we collect after deidentifying and aggregating it so it cannot be linked back to an individual person. We contractually require third parties to respect this practice.

However, the new entity will be bound by this privacy policy after the sale or transfer.
				</p>
          <p class="wpText">
