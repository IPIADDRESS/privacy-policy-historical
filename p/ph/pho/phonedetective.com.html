        <li>We transfer information about you       if we are acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, we       will notify you by sending a notice to the primary email address specified       in your account or by placing a prominent notice on our Website before       information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different       privacy policy.</li>
        <li>We may display targeted       advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad       serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or       click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women       ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.</li>
        <li>We do not provide any personal       information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted       advertisement. However, by interacting with or viewing an advertisement       you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the       assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the       advertisement.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>We may set and access our cookies       on your computer.</li>
