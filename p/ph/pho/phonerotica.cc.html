<p>PhonErotica respects your privacy. This policy explains how PhonErotica
will treat information that it may obtain from you as you make use of
the PhonErotica.cc site. The owners and operators of PhonErotica.cc ("PhonErotica")
provide the PhonErotica.cc site ("Site") subject to the terms of
this Privacy Policy. By using the Site, you accept and agree to this
Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy may change from time to time,
without notice other than appearing on the Site. The Revision Date
below will show you when the Privacy Policy was last revised.</p>
<h4>The PhonErotica Site and Third Party Sites</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to the PhonErotica Site. The Site
may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or
controlled by PhonErotica. PhonErotica has no control over, and assumes no
responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of
any third party website. You agree that you are responsible for
reviewing and understanding the privacy policies (if any) of any
third party websites you may access through this Site. By using this
Site, you release PhonErotica from any and all liability arising from
your use of any third party website to which this Site may be linked.</p>
<h4>Information Collected on this Site</h4>
<p>When you visit the Site, we may collect passive information about
your visit. Passive information is any form of aggregate data,
navigational data, tracking data, click-stream data, or historical
data. It may include the domain name of your internet service
provider (e.g., whether you logged on from aol.com or
whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., the address of the last URL you
visited prior to clicking through to the Site) and browser and
platform type (e.g., a Firefox browser on a Macintosh platform). We
use this information to track how users are accessing and using the
Site.</p>
<p>In addition, when you visit the Site we generally collect the IP
Address of the computer you are using to access the Site. (An IP, or
"Internet Protocol," address is a unique number associated
with your computer, that may be communicated to other computers and
servers when you use the Internet.) We use this information for
purposes of security and anti-fraud protection.</p>
<p>PhonErotica also uses cookies and/or web beacons. (A cookie is a small
amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and
stored on your computer's hard drive, and that may be accessed when
you use a website. A web beacon is a small, transparent graphic image
placed on a website, which allows the site to record the actions of a
visitor opening the page that contains the beacon.)</p>
<p>We may use cookies or web beacons to: (1) determine whether
visitors to the Site are unique, or whether the same user is visiting
the site on multiple occasions; (2) help deliver advertisements; (3)
track usage throughout the Site (e.g., tracking where traffic comes
from, how traffic flows within the Site, etc.); (4) store your
agreement to the terms and conditions for entering and using the
Site; (5) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors,
pages viewed, etc.</p>
<p>These kinds of information do not, on their own, personally
identify you. However, they can potentially be combined with
information obtained from other sources in order to identify you.
PhonErotica does not ordinarily seek or obtain personally identifying
information about users from others. It does reserve the right to
seek such information in the event of a violation of the PhonErotica
Terms of Service in the event of a dispute between PhonErotica and you,
or if required by law to do so.</p>
<h4>Content You Submit to or Post on the Site</h4>
<p>PhonErotica allows you to submit and post audio and video content, and
accompanying text ("User Content"). User Content that you
submit to PhonErotica or post on the Site, including any personal
information included in your User Content, becomes publicly available
and can be seen, collected, and used by others. You should not post
any content on the Site that you do not want to be seen, collected,
or used by others. 
</p>
<p>In the process of posting User Content, you may be asked to
provide some personally identifying information, such as your name,
address, and e-mail address, and other documentation. We will keep a
record of the information you provide, including your personally
identifiable information, and that information will be linked in our
records to the User Content. We will not publicly post your name or
other personally identifying information, and we will not provide
such information to our advertisers or business partners without your
permission. However, we may disclose the personally identifying
information and documentation you provide in some limited
circumstances, as set forth below ("Permitted Disclosures of
Personal Information").</p>
<h4>Use of Visitor Information Collected on the Site</h4>
<p>We do not collect or share personally identifiable information
about visitors to the site through the ordinary operation of the
Site. We may obtain and merge information about users and usage of
the Site into aggregated data, which may then be used by us and/or
shared with advertisers or others. When we provide aggregated
information to outside companies, they will not be able to identify
you or contact you based on that data. 
</p>
<h4>Usage Information - Collection and Use by Advertisers and Others</h4>
<p>PhonErotica allows other companies to place advertisements on the
Site. These companies use technology to deliver advertisements you
see on the Site directly to your browser. In doing so, they may
automatically receive your IP address. Other companies that place
advertising on the Site may have the ability to use cookies and/or
web beacons to collect information, including information about your
usage of the Site. We do not control the processes that advertisers
use to collect information. However, IP addresses, cookies and web
beacons alone generally cannot be used to identify individuals, only
machines. Therefore, advertisers and others whose advertisements or
content may appear on the Site generally will not know who you are
unless you provide additional information to them, by responding to
an advertisement, by entering into an agreement with them, or by some
other means.</p>
<h4>Children's Privacy</h4>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is important to us. We do
not knowingly allow children to use the Site, and all visitors to the
Site must confirm that they are at least 21 years old. We do not
collect or maintain information at our Web sites from those we
actually know are under 21, and no part of our Web site is structured
to attract anyone under 21.</p>
<h4>Permitted Disclosures of Personal Information</h4>
<p>PhonErotica generally does not collect personally identifiable
information (data such as your name, email address, password, and the
content of your communications) unless you submit User Content for
posting on the Site. PhonErotica will not disclose any personally
identifiable information it collects or obtains except: (1) as
described in the PhonErotica Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy; (2)
after obtaining your permission to a specific use or disclosure; (3)
if PhonErotica is required to do so in order to comply with any valid
legal process or governmental request (such as a court order, search
warrant, subpoena, civil discovery request, or statutory
requirement); (4) as required to protect PhonErotica's property, safety,
or operations, or the property or safety of others; or (5) as
otherwise required by law.</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>Some pages of the Site may use security measures to protect
against the loss, misuse and alteration of information that is
transmitted through the Site. However, no data transmission over the
Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be secure. As a
result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable
information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
information you transmit, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<h4>Questions or Concerns</h4>
<p>If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about PhonErotica's
Privacy Policy and use of personal information, please contact us
using our contact form.</p>
