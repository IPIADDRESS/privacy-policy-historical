We utilize commercially reasonable information security standards to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Northstar supports online security using appropriately secure technology because we want your data to be safe. We bind our employees and data processors to written agreements to observe your privacy and confidentiality rights. Unfortunately, no method of internet transmission is one hundred percent secure.

By using our products and services you understand and agree that your personal information may be transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA, which comprises the European Union countries plus Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein) to a country that does not have an equivalent level of data protection, such as the United States. When your personal information is transferred from your home country to another country, the laws and regulations that protect your personal information may be different than those in your home country. In particular, if your information is in the US, it may be accessed by government authorities in accordance with US law.</p><p>To the extent that Northstar is deemed to transfer your personal information outside the EEA, Northstar relies upon data transfer agreements with Model Contract Clauses, which the European Commission has adopted to provide safeguards for personal information that is transferred outside the EEA. You may obtain a copy of the Model Clauses by contacting&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@ntmllc.com">privacy@ntmllc.com</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2><p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. If we do, we will change the "effective date" at the top of the Privacy Policy. Before making any update that would make this Privacy Policy materially less restrictive in our use or disclosure of personal information collected prior to the update, we will provide prior notice of the update by posting notice on our Website at the top of the then-current Privacy Policy within a reasonable time before the effective date of the update. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.</p><h1>&nbsp;</h1><p></p></content>
