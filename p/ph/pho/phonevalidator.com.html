            number assigned to computers on the Internet). No personal information about you
            is revealed in this process because we do not collect any other identifying information

            pages you visit, the keywords you use to find the Site and other information detailing
            your use of the Site. If you do a search on the Site, we also track your IP to make
            sure you are not scraping our Site. The Site may also gather anonymous aggregate
            data for all visitors that does not personally identify you, but that may be helpful
            for marketing purposes or for improving the goods services we offer.

            we make no assurances about our ability to prevent any such loss, misuse, to you
            or to any third party arising out of any such loss, misuse, or alteration. If hackers
