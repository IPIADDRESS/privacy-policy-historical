<p>Phonezoo understands that privacy is extremely important to you and is committed to protecting the privacy
of your personal information.  This Privacy Policy explains how Phonezoo Communications, Inc.
("Phonezoo") collects and uses personally identifiable information about visitors to the
site and users of the service.  By visiting the Phonezoo site or using its services, you are
accepting the practices outline in this Privacy Policy.  This policy does not apply to the
practices of third parties that Phonezoo does not own or control, or to individuals that
Phonezoo does not employ or manage.   </p>
<p><u>The information Phonezoo collects</u></p>
<p>Phonezoo collects non-personally identifiable information when you visit our website
(www.phonezoo.com).  This data includes your IP address, the IP address and URL of the Website
that sent you to the Phonezoo main page, browser cookie and browser type.  This data is
automatically recorded in our server logs and is used to manage the website, track usage and
improve the Phonezoo website and services.  </p>
<p>When you use Phonezoo services and register for Phonezoo, we collect additional information
such as your name, mobile phone number, mobile phone device information and network carrier
information. We also collect any optional information you choose to enter like email address,
location information (such as address, zip code, and country), gender and age.</p>
<p>When you connect to the Phonezoo services on your mobile device, if your mobile phone service
provider uniquely identifies the device, Phonezoo will receive this information. Phonezoo may
use your unique mobile device identification information to offer you extended services and/or
functionality. Some mobile phone service providers are required to operate a system that will
record the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the mobile phone
service provider, Phonezoo may automatically receive this information.</p>
<p>When you visit the Phonezoo site, we may send one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.  Phonezoo uses both session cookies - cookies that expire after you close your browser - and persistent cookies - cookies that can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Some of our business partners may use cookies on our website (for example, advertisers).  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.  The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies.  We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Phonezoo's most attractive features.</p>
<p>Phonezoo members can invite friends to join the service and preview content by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. Phonezoo stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added as Friends of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations.  Phonezoo does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations, invitation reminders (up to three (3) per email address). </p>
<p><strong>We will not sell, rent or otherwise distribute personal information to third parties without your consent, except in instances described below.</strong></p>
<p><u>How Phonezoo uses your personal information</u></p>
<p>Phonezoo uses your personal information to operate, maintain and provide you with the features and functionality of the Phonezoo site and services.  Phonezoo uses your mobile phone number to deliver the mobile content you create and other content you request.  <strong>Phonezoo will not use your mobile phone number to call you or send commercial or marketing messages. </strong></p>
<p>Additionally, Phonezoo will not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or subsequently opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Phonezoo service changes or for customer service purposes). </p>
<p>Phonezoo uses personally identifiable and certain non-personally identifiable information so that:</p>

</ul>
<p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online (on the Phonezoo site, in our discussion, rating and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others.
