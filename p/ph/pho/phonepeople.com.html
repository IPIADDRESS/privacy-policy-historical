                The Company collects information from its users at several different points on the
                Site and through the Services, both directly from the user (including through interactions
                with Customer Service and Sales) and through the use of technologies such as cookies,
                log files and clear gifs.

                    In order to use the Services, you must first complete the registration process.
                    During registration you are required to provide contact information (such as name,
                    phone number and email address). We use this information to contact you about the
                    Services and other services offered by the Company for which you have expressed
                    interest or that you might be interested in. We may request or require that users
                    provide general demographic information so we can provide a more personalized experience.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A user must also provide financial information (such as credit card number and expiration
                    date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customers' orders.
                    If we have trouble processing an order and/or collecting payment, the contact information
                    is used to contact the user.

                    We may collect information pertaining solely to corporations, governmental or educational
                    entities, or other businesses or not for profit entities, such as a company's address.
                    We may use any such information without restriction.

                    A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about
                    the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session
                    ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent
                    cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period
                    of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file
                    directions.

                    <br>
                    Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information while
                    on the Site except if you choose to store your user name and password so that you
                    do not have to enter it each time you access your account. Then a persistent cookie
                    will be stored on your computer which is linked to your account information.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you reject the persistent cookie, you may still use the Site but you will be
                    limited in some areas of it. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target
                    the interests of our users to enhance their experience on the Site. See the "Profile"
                    section below.

                    <br>
                    Some of our business partners (for example, advertisers) may use cookies on the
                    Site or in emails or in our advertisements on other Web sites. The cookies are not
                    linked to any personally identifiable information. This Policy covers the use of
                    cookies by the Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
                    Our advertisers have their own privacy policies which you should consult.

                    Like most Web sites, our servers use log files to analyze trends, administer the
                    Site, track users' movements in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information
                    for aggregate use. These log files are not linked to personally identifiable information.

                    Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies,
                    and we may use them to track the online movements of our users. Clear gifs are invisible
                    on the page and are much smaller than cookies, about the size of the period at the
                    end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable
                    information. We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know
                    which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness
                    of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users
                    would like to opt-out of receiving these emails, please see the “Choice/Opt-out”
                    section below.

                    We may store information that we collect through cookies, log files and clear gifs
                    to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on
                    individual users that details their viewing preferences and Services usage. Third
                    parties may also furnish us with additional information about your preferences.
                    Consequently, information may be tied to the user's personally identifiable information
                    to improve the content of the Site for the user, and to direct pertinent product
                    updates and marketing promotions to them if they have opted in to receive those
                    promotions. We do not share personally identifiable elements of your profile with
                    third parties, your profile would only be shared in aggregate form.

                    The Company does not release personally identifying information about our customers
                    or monitor, edit or disclose the contents of a user's private communications through
                    the Services except where the Company in good faith believes that such action is
                    necessary to: (1) comply with the law or where we have a good-faith belief that
                    such disclosure is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court
                    order or legal process served on us; (2) investigate, prevent or take action regarding
                    illegal activity; (3) protect and defend the rights or property of the Company;
                    or (4) to protect the personal safety of our users or the public. For example, we
                    may disclose personal information to law enforcement, other government officials
                    or third parties in response to criminal or civil subpoenas. Sometimes, these subpoena
                    requests come from our third party Internet, telecommunications and collocation
                    providers all over the world who supply the network required for us to deliver our
                    Services. In order to maintain the integrity of our network, we often cooperate
                    with requests from these third party providers and/or requests from law enforcement
                    or other governmental officials directed to these providers. In cases where the
                    Company believes that disclosure of any information about a user (including account
                    information) is necessary, the Company reserves the right to disclose all information
                    in our possession about such user.

                    we use third parties and we may share users' information with these third parties.
                    For example, the Company verifies the billing address on all credit card transactions
                    and may obtain credit reports for some corporate users. We use an outside credit
                    card processing company to bill users for Services. In addition, we may use third

                The Company takes every reasonable precaution to protect its users' information.
                When our registration/order forms ask users to enter their personally identifiable
                information, that information is protected with encryption software called SSL.
                Any activities after you log into your account are also encrypted with SSL.

                a specific job (for example, our billing clerks or a Customer Service representative)
                are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers

                If a user's credit card information changes (such as name, address or credit card
