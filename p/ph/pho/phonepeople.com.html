<p style="text-align: left;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;"><strong>1. Information Collection </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">The Company collects information from its users at several different points on the Site and through the Services, both directly from the user (including through interactions with Customer Service and Sales) and through the use of technologies such as cookies, log files and clear gifs. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;"><strong>a.  Registration</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">In order to use the Services, you must first complete the registration process. During registration you are required to provide contact information (such as name, phone number and email address).  We use this information to contact you about the Services and other services offered by the Company for which you have expressed interest or that you might be interested in.  We may request or require that users provide general demographic information so we can provide a more personalized experience.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">A user must also provide financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customers' orders. If we have trouble processing an order and/or collecting payment, the contact information is used to contact the user. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;"><strong>b.  Entity Users</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt;">
</span><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">We may collect information pertaining solely to corporations, governmental or educational entities, or other businesses or not for profit entities, such as a company's address. We may use any such information without restriction. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;"><strong>c.  Cookies</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information while on the Site except if you choose to store your user name and password so that you do not have to enter it each time you access your account. Then a persistent cookie will be stored on your computer which is linked to your account information.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">If you reject the persistent cookie, you may still use the Site but you will be limited in some areas of it. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on the Site. See the "Profile" section below. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">Some of our business partners (for example, advertisers) may use cookies on the Site or in emails or in our advertisements on other Web sites.   The cookies are not linked to any personally identifiable information.  This Policy covers the use of cookies by the Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.  Our advertisers have their own privacy policies which you should consult.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;"><strong>c.  Log Files</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">Like most Web sites, our servers use log files to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. These log files are not linked to personally identifiable information. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;"><strong>d.  Clear Gifs</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and we may use them to track the online movements of our users. Clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller than cookies, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information. We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of receiving these emails, please see the “Choice/Opt-out” section below. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;"><strong>e.  Profile</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">We may store information that we collect through cookies, log files and clear gifs to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences and Services usage.  Third parties may also furnish us with additional information about your preferences.  Consequently, information may be tied to the user's personally identifiable information to improve the content of the Site for the user, and to direct pertinent product updates and marketing promotions to them if they have opted in to receive those promotions. We do not share personally identifiable elements of your profile with third parties, your profile would only be shared in aggregate form. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;"><strong>f.</strong></span><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">  </span><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;"><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal information of a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">The Company does not release personally identifying information about our customers or monitor, edit or disclose the contents of a user's private communications through the Services except where the Company in good faith believes that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or where we have a good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us; (2) investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activity; (3) protect and defend the rights or property of the Company; or (4) to protect the personal safety of our users or the public. For example, we may disclose personal information to law enforcement, other government officials or third parties in response to criminal or civil subpoenas. Sometimes, these subpoena requests come from our third party Internet, telecommunications and collocation providers all over the world who supply the network required for us to deliver our Services.  In order to maintain the integrity of our network, we often cooperate with requests from these third party providers and/or requests from law enforcement or other governmental officials directed to these providers.  In cases where the Company believes that disclosure of any information about a user (including account information) is necessary, the Company reserves the right to disclose all information in our possession about such user.</span></p>

We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for Services. In addition, we may use third parties to host certain portions of our Site, to fulfill certain requests for information from our users, to comply with legal requirements and to communicate with customers</span><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt; color:#FF0000;">,.</span><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;"> In order to personalize a user's experience and provide relevant offers from us or our third party advertisers, we may share users' information with third parties to learn more about users and their preferences.

<p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">In the event the Company goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be included as part of the assets transferred.

<p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 36pt;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">Individual users who reside in California and have provided their personally identifiable information to the Company may request once per calendar year information about Company's disclosures of certain categories of personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Such requests should be directed to the Chief Privacy Officer at <span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;"><a href="mailto:cpo@j2global.com">cpo@j2global.com</a></span><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">. Within thirty days of receiving such a request, we will provide a list of categories of personal information shared during the immediately preceding calendar year with other businesses for their direct marketing purposes, and the names and addresses of those third parties. The Company reserves its right to not respond to requests submitted other than to the email address specified in this section.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;"><strong>4.  Security</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">The Company takes every reasonable precaution to protect its users’ information. When our registration/order forms ask users to enter their personally identifiable information, that information is protected with encryption software called SSL. Any activities after you log into your account are also encrypted with SSL.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">While we use SSL encryption to protect personally identifiable information online, we also employ security measures to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the personally identifiable information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerks or a Customer Service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;"><strong>5.  Changing Your Credit Card Information or Cancelling Your Service</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">If a user's credit card information changes (such as name, address or credit card number), users can change their credit card information by logging into their PhonePeople Control Panel &amp; Support Center online and going to My Account.  If a user wants to terminate their Service, they must call Customer Service or open a support case within the PhonePeople Control Panel &amp; Support Center to request termination.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;"><strong>6.  Notification of Changes</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">If we decide to change our Policy in a non-material way, we will post those changes in this Policy, and other places we deem appropriate, so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">If, however, we change our Policy in a material way, we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted if we change our Policy, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;"><strong>8.  Data Retention</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:8pt;">The time period for which we keep information varies according to how we use the information. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we do not retain it for any longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be further processed. &nbsp;</span></p>
