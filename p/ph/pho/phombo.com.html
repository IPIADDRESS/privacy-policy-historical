</ul>

<h4>2. Information Use</h4>

You may opt-out of receiving non-essential communications; however, certain essential emails, which are necessary for the administration and maintenance of your account, may still be communicated with you.</p>

<h4>3. Information Sharing</h4>

<p>We do not rent, sell or share your personal information with other people or companies except when we receive your permission.</p>

<p>In the case Phombo is acquired by or merged with another company, Phombo will transfer your information to the acquired or merged company. However, Phombo will notify you before your information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

<h4>4. Information Access</h4>

<p>You have the right to view or edit your personal information yourself when you are signed into your account, or have the right to request that Phombo edit the information on your behalf.</p>

<p>For personal information that may not be accessible via the websites, you may still access that information by writing to us by email to privacy@phombo.com, or through our <a href="/contact/"> contact form</a>, and we will contact you within 30 days regarding your request.</p>

<p>You also have the right to limit certain personal information from being displayed on your user profile for the public to view.  You may request that Phombo limit the information for you.</p>

Your preference and information may be stored on the cookies in order to simplify your experience by saving you time from repeatedly entering the same information. When you sign in to Phombo using your credentials, cookies will allow you to move from page to page without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out of, or after 60 minutes of inactivity, these cookies are deleted or expired from your computer.</p>

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.</p>

<h3>Third Party Advertising</h3>

<p>Ads may be delivered to you by Phombo or one of our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may set cookies, which would allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Phombo and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h3>Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
