				<div class="content">By installing or using the application, software and services known as “Twidroyd,” you individually or the entity on whose behalf you are acting agree that your use of Twidroyd or the website www.twidroyd.com (the “Website”) is subject to this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”).
This Policy informs you about the ways in which PostUp, Inc. (“Company” or “we”) knowingly collects and uses information collected via the Website and Twidroyd. 
<br><br>
<b>Information Collected</b>
<br>
In order to facilitate your use of Twidroyd and the Website, and in order to provide the full range of features of Twidroyd, we may collect the following types of information (the “Information”):
<br>
<ul>
<li>Personal Information You Provide -”Personal Information” means information about you that is personally identifiable, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, user name and passwords or other personal information voluntarily provided by you in connection with your use of Twidroyd or the Website and that is not otherwise publicly available.  We may also collect Personal Information you choose to voluntarily provide to the Company when providing feedback or questions.</li>

<li>Content you Submit  – The term “Submissions” is defined in the Twidroyd End User License Agreement &amp; Terms (the “Terms”).  The most recent version of the Terms is located at www.twidroyd.com.</li>

<li>Non-Personal Information – We also collect and store “Non-Personal Information,” such as technical information and related data about your usage of Twidroyd. We use this Non-Personal Information to better understand the use of Twidroyd and/or the Website, to improve and revise Twidroyd and/or the Website and to track interest.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
In connection with your visit to www.twidroyd.com, we may use cookies to store your Website preferences, usage patterns, and other information so that the Website, and the websites and tools of our partners, will function better for you on subsequent visits. The Website or its partners may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and for other similar purposes. A “cookie” is a tiny file that your browser places on your computer’s hard drive, which acts to identify your computer. Cookie and cookie tracking technology is useful for gathering information such as browser type and operating system, tracking the number of visitors to the Website and partner sites, and understanding how visitors use the Website. Cookies can also help tailor the Website and partner sites to visitors’ needs and help customize the Website and partner sites for visitors. Personally identifiable information cannot be collected via cookies and other tracking technology; however, if you previously provided personally identifiable information (as discussed above), cookies may be tied to such information. Aggregated cookie and tracking information may be shared with third parties. Most modern browsers allow users to decide whether to accept cookies, but rejection of cookies may cause some parts of the Website to not function properly or be inaccessible.
<br><br>

<b>Use of Information</b>
<br><br>
By using Twidroyd or visiting the Website, you hereby consent to the collection and processing of Information by the Company.  We may use Personal Information to keep you up to date on the latest announcements regarding Twidroyd or upgrades or updates, and to better understand your needs and provide you with better services.  Our use includes transmission of your Information to the Twitter service in order to process your posting and communications, and such use is subject to Twitter’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, as provided on www.twitter.com.  In addition, your Submissions (as defined in the Terms) are subject to our use as described in the Terms; provided that our default is to not make public information that you have set to private on your twitter account (i.e. non-public Tweets).
<br><br>
We may share your Information with our trusted business partners so they may also offer services that complement those provided by us or with third parties that assist us with Twidroyd and/or this Website. For example, we may engage third parties to make improvements on Twidroyd and/or our Website, to offer new products, to provide e-mail and other marketing support, and to allow us to customize your experience with Twidroyd and/or on the Website. When we engage third party companies, they have access to Information as needed to perform their functions, but they may not use it for other purposes. We may disclose any Information to third parties if we believe release is necessary to comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order or to help prevent fraud or enforce or protect the rights and properties of the Company or its affiliates.
<br><br>
Further, we may disclose Personal Information if you opt-in (either at the time of providing personally identifiable information, or at a later time) to have us share your Personal Information with our partners for the purpose of receiving information from our partners and other companies.  In addition, we may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public Tweets.
<br><br>
In the event of an acquisition of all or part of the Company by another company, or in the event that the Company sells or disposes of all or a part of the Twidroyd business, the acquirer will have access to the Information maintained by us, which can include Personal Information, subject to applicable law. Similarly, Information may be transferred as part of a reorganization or insolvency proceeding.
<br><br>
We process information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. We may process Information on servers outside of your country. In addition, Personal Information may be shared with a third party to support services for us as described above, and such third party may store Personal Information on servers located in or outside the United States.
<br><br>
Although we use reasonable efforts to maintain the privacy of your personally identifiable data and information, due to technological limitations, and the risk of unlawful interceptions and accessing of transmissions and/or data, we cannot completely assure you, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable data and information, and any other electronically communicated information, will be absolutely confidential.
<br><br>
<b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b><br>
We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Any amendments made to this Privacy Policy will be considered effective after the amendments are posted on the Website.
