									W3 Data, Inc. ("W3 Data") is committed to protecting 
									your privacy. By participating in the Council of Better 
									Business Bureau's BBBOnLine Privacy Program we 
									have made a commitment to meet the program's 
									strict requirements regarding how we treat your 
									information and have it verified by 
									<a href="http://www.bbbonline.org" target="new">www.bbbonline.org</a>. 
									Further information about this program is available 
									at www.bbbonline.org. This privacy policy ("Privacy 
									Policy") explains the type of information W3 Data 
									collects through 
									<a href="http://www.w3data.com/">www.w3data.com</a> 
									and any services 
									offered therein (e.g., BatchAppend411 and 
									EnterpriseDA), 
									<a href="http://www.whitepages.com/" target="new">www.whitepages.com</a> 
									as well as any 
									Web site incorporating the content of 
									<a href="http://www.whitepages.com/" target="new">www.whitepages.com</a>
									(the "Whitepages.com Network"), 
									and My WhitePages ("MyWP"). MyWP, 
									BatchAppend411, EnterpriseDA and the 
									WhitePages.com Network offer electronic 
									information services provided by W3 Data which 
									allow you to access a list of names, addresses, 
									telephone numbers and other information compiled 
									from telephone company databases (the 
									"Service(s)"). For purposes of this Privacy Policy, 
									viewing any portion of the aforementioned Web sites 
									that offer Services is considered a "use" of the 
									Services. 
								</p>
<p>
									Please read the following Privacy Policy carefully 
									before using the Services. If you use any of the 
									Services, you will be bound by the terms of this 
									Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may change from 
									time to time so you should check it frequently. 
									If you do not want us to contact you via telephone, please contact 
									<a href="javascript:emailPopup('/cross_site/w3/w3_email?PARAM_subject=PhoneNumber.com%20Inquiry&amp;PARAM_to_email=support@w3data.com&amp;PARAM_section_ref=privacy');">customer support</a>.
								</p>
<p>
									W3 DATA COLLECTS AND STORES 
									INFORMATION ABOUT THE WEB PAGES YOU 
									VIEW, THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US IN 
									CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE 
									SERVICES AND THE DATA YOU ENTER IN 
									ONLINE FORMS AND SEARCHES. ALTHOUGH 
									W3 DATA DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO ANALYZE 
									INTERNET USAGE DATA TO DETERMINE THE 
									IDENTITY OF ANY SERVICE USER, SOME 
									INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE SERVICES 
									ARE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE. W3 DATA 
									AGGREGATES AND ANALYZES THE 
									INFORMATION IT COLLECTS TO IMPROVE ITS 
									SERVICES AND TO PREPARE REPORTS ABOUT 
									AGGREGATE INTERNET USAGE AND YOUR 
									DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE LOOK-UP HABITS. IN 
									ADDITION, WHEN YOU USE THE SERVICES 
									YOUR SEARCH RESULTS WILL BE 
									TRANSMITTED TO AND LOGGED BY W3 DATA 
									AND MAY BE CORRELATED BY W3 DATA WITH 
									ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION 
									YOU MAY HAVE PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED TO W3 
									DATA. 
								</p>
<p><strong>What types of information does W3 Data collect?</strong></p>
<p>
									If you are using any of the Services, we may collect 
									the following information: the full Uniform Resource 
									Locator ("URL") of the Web page from which you 
									came to the Services; your Internet Protocol ("IP") 
									address, which may include a domain name; the 
									date and time for each page you view; the name of 
									and information about any advertisement that 
									brought you to the Web pages that offer the 
									Services; searches you perform, links you click on; 
									and computer and connection information such as 
									browser type and version, operating system, and 
									platform. We also transmit cookies to your computer 
									so we can track the pages of our Web site that you 
									view and the order in which you view them. 
								</p>
<p>
									If you e-mail W3 Data we collect your message, the 
									recipient e-mail address(es), and your e-mail 
									address for the purpose of sending the e-mail. We 
									do not send other e-mail to these address(es).
								</p>
<p>
									Certain Services (e.g., BatchAppend411) allow you 
									to send us the personal identifiable information of 
									third parties.  We treat such personal identifiable 
									information as if it is your personal identifiable 
									information (i.e., this Privacy Policy covers third 
									party personal identifiable information provided by 
									you to us).
								</p>
<p>
									If you use the Services, we collect any information 
									voluntarily provided by you during the registration 
									process (if applicable), which can include your e-mail 
									address as well as billing information and 
									demographic information such as gender, age, 
									occupation, household income, zip code and 
									country. We also collect the name of and information 
									about any advertisement that brought you to the 
									Web pages that offer the Services. 
									Demographic information is correlated to Internet 
									usage collected during your use of the Service, but 
									we do not attempt to determine your identity by 
									analyzing this information. 
								</p>
<p>
									When you use the Services we transmit cookies to 
									the hard drive of your computer. These cookies 
									assign your Web browser a unique series of 
									numbers, letters, or characters that enable W3 
									Data's servers to recognize and identify your Web 
									browser when you are using the Service. They also 
									enable W3 Data to track and store information about 
									your Internet usage path while using the Service. 
									See below for more information about how W3 Data 
									uses this data. 
								</p>
<p>
									When you use the Services we collect information 
									about the Web sites you visit (e.g., by clicking on 
									advertisements) and the Web pages you view. This 
									information allows us to build our database of 
									information about related Web pages. Thus, for 
									every Web page you view while using a Service, the 
									Service transmits and stores the following 
									information from your computer to W3 Data: 
									</p><ul>
<li>your IP address, which may include a domain name; </li>
<li>the full URL of the Web page you are visiting;</li>
<li>general information about your browser; </li>
<li>general information about your computer's operating system; </li>
<li>your cookie number; and </li>
<li>the date and time the above information is logged. </li>
</ul>
									All of the above information is logged together in a 
									single data string for each Web page you visit. Each 
									string is logged in our database. 
								<p></p>
<p><strong>Does W3 Data collect personally identifiable information?</strong></p>
<p>
									The URLs we collect through your use of the 
									Services sometimes contain personal information 
									about you. For example, when you enter information 
									on a Web page (e.g., when you complete an online 
									registration form or advertisement form) the operator 
									of the Web site may insert that information into its 
									URL for that or the next page. This information often 
									appears after a question mark ("?") in the URL, 
									although it can appear in other places. This means 
									that your name, your address, your e-mail address, 
									or similar information you might consider private or 
									personally identifiable which you enter into a Web 
									page sometimes becomes part of a URL and is 
									automatically stored in W3 Data databases. This can 
									also occur with words, topics, products, or phrases 
									you enter into search engines - whether those 
									engines are provided by the Services or found 
									elsewhere on the Internet - while using the Services. 
									W3 Data has no control over what information third 
									party Web sites put into their URLs or where they 
									put it, and any information in each URL is collected 
									and stored by W3 Data when you are using the 
									Services. 
								</p>
<p>
									W3 Data analyzes its logs of usage path collected 
									from users to determine Internet usage in the 
									aggregate. Further, by storing this information with 
									users' cookie numbers, W3 Data correlates each 
									user's usage path information and demographic 
									information to each other. 
								</p>
<p>
									We may monitor and record telephone communications 
									between you and our employees for quality control and 
									training purposes. We protect the personally identifiable 
									information we collect through these telephone recordings 
									and transcriptions in the same manner as other personally 
									identifiable information covered by this policy. We will only permit 
									authorized employees and business associates to access these 
									recordings or transcriptions.  By using the Services you hereby 
									consent to such monitoring and recording unless you affirmatively 
									inform W3 Data that you do not want such telephone conversations 
									recorded or monitored.
								</p>
<p>
									All transmissions between you and W3 Data, 
									including e-mails, URLs, cookie identification 
									numbers, usage paths, and any personally 
									identifiable information they might contain, pass 
									through many third party machines, operating 
									systems, programs, browsers, Internet servers, 
									networks, routers, Ethernet switches, ISPs, proxy 
									servers, intranets, the public telephone systems, or 
									other devices, any of which may create activity logs 
									containing such transmissions. 
								</p>
<p><strong>What does W3 Data do with the information it collects?</strong></p>
<p>
									If you gave us your e-mail address when you registered, we may use it to send
									you W3 Data newsletters, product updates, service-related information, and
									other offers and information from W3 Data or its business partners. If you gave
									us your telephone number, we may use your telephone number to contact you to
									discuss your use of the Services or other matters pertaining to the Services. 
									W3 Data also may contact you by e-mail or telephone to respond to any customer
									service inquiries you submit. We do not disclose your e-mail address to
									business partners or to anyone other than employees and agents working for or
									on behalf of W3 Data, except as required by subpoenas, court orders, or legal
									requirements. We do not use your e-mail address to correlate your identity to
									your Internet usage paths. By using the Services you hereby give W3 Data
									permission to contact you via e-mail or telephone.  If you do not want to
									receive W3 Data newsletters, offers, or product and service information, simply
									click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the unwanted e-mail message or
									<a href="javascript:newsPopup('/cross_site/w3/newsletter_unsubscribe_form.xhtml')">http://www.w3data.com/newsletter_unsubscribe_form.xhtml</a>.
									 If you do not want us to contact you via telephone, please inform us of this fact via e-mail at
									<a href="javascript:emailPopup('/cross_site/w3/w3_email?PARAM_subject=PhoneNumber.com%20Inquiry&amp;PARAM_to_email=support@w3data.com&amp;PARAM_section_ref=privacy');">customer support</a>.
								</p>
<p>
									We use cookies for such functions as verifying that 
									you are a Services user and counting and tracking 
									your Web site visits. We further use cookies to 
									determine the number of visitors that use the 
									Services or come to a web site offering the Services 
									through a particular advertisement. Your cookie 
									number is also used to create usage paths and to 
									correlate those with any demographic information 
									you provide, but we do not use your cookies or usage 
									paths to attempt to determine your identity. 
								</p>
<p>
									We use IP addresses to diagnose problems with our 
									servers and to administer our Web sites. Your IP 
									address also is used by W3 Data to gather broad 
									demographic information, such as your general 
									geographic location and Internet Service Provider. 
									IP addresses are further used to help determine the 
									number of Service users. This demographic 
									information may also be used by W3 Data to 
									analyze aggregate Internet usage behavior. 
								</p>
<p><strong>How does W3 Data share the information it collects?</strong></p>
<p>
									W3 Data does not intentionally disclose personally 
									identifying information collected from any user to any 
									third party without the user's consent.  In no event 
									will W3 Data use any personally identifiable 
									information for direct marketing purposes.
								</p>
<p>
									We provide "stripped" usage path information and 
									demographic information to researchers. They use it 
									to prepare analyses of aggregate Internet patterns 
									and trends. Such analyses are used in research and 
									commercial reports provided to third parties. We 
									disclose any information we possess in response to 
									subpoenas, court orders, or legal requirements, and 
									such information might be used by the receiving 
									party to determine your identity, your Internet usage, 
									or other things about you. We generally do not 
									inform users of such requests for information, 
									although we might try to do so in some cases. 
								</p>
<p>
									We employ other companies and individuals to 
									perform functions on our behalf, such as technical 
									support services. To perform those functions, it may 
									be necessary for them to obtain access to W3 Data's 
									databases and servers, which may contain 
									personally identifying information about users. They 
									may not use such access or information for any 
									purpose other than that for which they are retained. 
								</p>
<p>
									In the event that W3 Data or substantially all of its 
									assets are sold or acquired, all information collected 
									by W3 Data would be transferred to the acquiring 
									party. In any such transfer, however, such 
									information would remain subject to any applicable 
									terms and conditions, including the terms of this

								</p>
<p><strong>How we use third party personal identifiable information.</strong></p>
<p>
									For certain Services you may provide W3 Data with 
									third party personal identifiable information.  If you 
									provide us third party personal identifiable 
									information in connection with your use of the 
									Services, we will only use such information to the 
									extent it enables us to provide the Services to you.  
									You consent to our providing the third party personal

<p>
									W3 Data uses commercially reasonable computer

									destruction, misuse, modification, or inadvertent or 
									improper disclosure of data. These risks, however, 
									cannot be completely eliminated and W3 Data 
									therefore cannot guarantee complete security.
