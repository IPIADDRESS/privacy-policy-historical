We didnât want to just copy what other people are doing, because that isnât always working.</p><p>The reason is we want to look to the future and serve the present. We simply cannot do that while hanging on to the past. I have heard from so many of you, that you no longer have a DVD player in your computer and that most new computers havenât had a DVD ROM for a number of years.</p><p>I have also heard from a lot of you, that you are now wanting to watch your training on tablets and phones. However, you donât necessarily want to be connected to&nbsp;the internet all the time. You travel on trains in planes, busses, and ubers and want to watch your training there too (Actually this is the best time to learn. Turn your commute into a university).</p><p>Another thing, Adobe is doing smaller, incremental updates between major releases. Itâs impossible to do a re-run of a DVD each time and send it out. Also, emailing a new download is difficult, and if you miss the email, you would miss the update.</p><p>So the solution that we came up with is PhotoshopCAFE ANYWHERE.</p><p>This means, in the future, when you buy premium training from PhotoshopCAFE, you can download it to your computer. All the video files are in the clips folder and named in such a way, that they will be easy to use when you copy them to your mobile devices (Through iTunes, or your player of choice). So you can watch them anywhere.</p><p>But thatâs just part of anywhere. The other part is anytime access. You will have your own control panel, where all your downloads will be listed and you can re-download them, whenever you like.</p><p>This means, on certain training, we will be able to drop in updates that you will be able to download them whenever you like and stay up to date.</p><p>In fact, if you have purchased a download from us in the past 3 years, just log into your account and your downloads are there now, today!</p><p>BONUS. You know those nice bonuses, the&nbsp;Superguides and blending modes ebook.? Yup, you can also download those whenever you like from your account.</p><p>Let me show&nbsp;you what you can do. Go to your account and login. (Note, this email list and PhotoshopCAFE account are not the same. If you have made a purchase in the past 3 years, you will have an account at PhotoshopCAFE). If you just want the free bonuses, you can create an account for free <a href="https://photoshopcafe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at PhotoshopCAFE</a>.</p><p>1.

We have lots of work to do and lots of ideas to expand all of this for&nbsp;you in the future. PhotoshopCAFE is one of the longest-running Photoshop resources in the world, and we plan to be around to serve you long into the future. PhotoshopCAFE ANYWHERE is one way that we can do this.</p><h1 class="null">FAQ:</h1><p><strong>1. So you are ending DVDs?</strong><br> After 17 years and pioneering CD and DVD Roms in our industry (yes, we were the first), we have to cut the anchor, DVDs are fast becoming obsolete. However, you will be able to get them at our sister site <a href="http://software-cinema.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software-cinema.com</a>&nbsp;(we are launching a new SC site very soon too â with DVDs).</p><p><strong>2. I bought a DVD, can it be added to my account?</strong><br> Unfortunately, there just isnât a way to do that right now, the man-hours would be enormous to do that.If you have a DVD, you can still copy the digital files from the clips folder to your mobile devices and other computers, so you still have the ability to watch your training anywhere.</p><p><strong>3. Is this a subscription?</strong><br> No, you still buy your training as you need it and some of the courses will come with free updates in between major Adobe updates. Big releases like 2017/2018 will be paid purchases.</p><p><strong>4. What about streaming video?</strong><br> We have had streaming video for 2 years now at <a href="http://academy.photoshopcafe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">academy.photoshopCAFE.com</a> If you have purchased our streaming training courses, nothing has changed for you, just remember that itâs a separate account login. We are looking at adding a streaming option to PhotoshopCAFE in the near future. (Just one exciting feature on its way)</p><p><strong>5. I bought a download 4 years ago, 10 years ago. Can it be added?</strong><br> We can go back 3 years because this is how long we have been using the database solution we have and we are able to import accounts. Before that, we processed everything manually and we didnât have accounts.</p><p>Please also be aware, that there might still be a few little bugs as we sweep up the dust on this big release. Let us know if you find any (please be patient as we fix them).</p><p>I hope you are as excited as we are moving forward! This is just the beginning and Iâd love to hear what you would like to see here at your CAFE.</p></div></div><div class="image_banner"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><h2>The Ultimate</h2><h3>Photoshop Resource</h3></div><div class="col-md-6 button_alignment" style="margin-top: 25px;"><div class="orange_button"><div><a href="https://photoshopcafe.com/video/videos.htm">Our Courses</a></div></div><div class="classic_transparent_button"><div><a href="https://photoshopcafe.com/free-tutorials/">Browse Tutorials</a></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-4"><div class="left_column_footer"><div class="logo_footer"><img src="https://photoshopcafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/logo-footer.png" alt="logo"></div><p>Based out of Southern California, we have been providing high Quality Photoshop training for 20 years.
