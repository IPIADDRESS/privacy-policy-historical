<p>Northstar Travel Media, LLC ("Northstar") publishes this Internet Privacy Policy to inform you of our practices concerning the collection and use of information you provide us through interactions with this website and other Northstar-affiliated websites. This policy is not applicable to information gathered by other methods or controlled by other agreements.</p>
 
<p>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION<br>
Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, that is not otherwise publicly available. Northstar collects personal information in a variety of ways, including when you register with Northstar on this website; when you subscribe to or use Northstar products or services; when you visit Northstar websites or the websites of certain Northstar partners; and when you enter Internet-based contests, promotions or sweepstakes sponsored or administered by Northstar; when you subscribe to receive Northstar e-letters, daily, news, supplier hot specials and similar e-mail notices; when you register for or participate in events, virtual tradeshows and educational programs such as seminars, webinars, etc., that Northstar conducts from time to time.<br>
<br>
When you register on our website or for our products and services, we ask for and collect information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, and industry. For some products and services we may also ask for your address and information about you or your business's assets or income. Once you register with Northstar and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.<br>
<br>
If you are purchasing something from a Northstar website, we need to know personal information such as your name, email address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. This information may also be used by Northstar to notify you of related products and services. Credit card information will not be shared or sold to unaffiliated third parties for any purpose without your express permission, except as necessary to process the transaction.</p>
 
<p>COOKIES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES<br>
We collect information through technology, such as cookies, pixels, and Web beacons, including when you visit our websites. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Northstar or its advertisers may send a cookie to your computer through your browser. Northstar uses cookies to track page requests and the duration of each user's visit, and the use of cookies allows us to provide a user's browser with information tailored to the visitor's preferences and needs and to also streamline the user's visits to our website. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept cookies, your experience at our website and other websites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.
Pixel tags are tiny graphic images that tell us what parts of the website have been visited or measure the effectiveness of searches users perform on the website. We may also use pixel tags in email messages to tell us whether emails have been opened to assure that we are only sending messages that are of interest to our users.<br>
<br>
In addition, Northstar automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Northstar cookie information, and the website page you request. Northstar uses this information to help diagnose problems with our servers, for system administration, and to examine our website traffic in aggregate. The information may be collected and used to improve the content of our Web pages and to customize content and/or layout for each user.<br>
<br>
Please note that Northstar may allow third party advertisers that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Among other things, these third parties may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to enable such third parties to record which ads your browser has loaded and which pages you may have been viewing when the ads were delivered or accessed. Advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Northstar Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS<br>
Under a provision of California law, a California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. Because this website is intended for use on a business-to-business basis, this provision of California law will not apply, in most cases, to the information collected.<br>
<br>
California residents who utilize this website for personal, family, or household purposes may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing lbuchanan@ntmllc.com. You should put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the subject field of your email. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email address.</p>

<p>DO-NOT-TRACK<br>
Our website does not respond to "do-not-track" settings in users' web browsers at this time. However, there are various ways to opt out of interest-based advertising, such as TRUSTe's Ad Choices, the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out Page, or you can also visit Google's Ad Settings to manage the ads Google serves.</p>
 
<p>YOUR CONSENT TO THIS POLICY<br>
 By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of information by Northstar as specified in this policy. Please also note that your use of the website is governed by the Northstar Terms and Service. If you do not agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service, please do not use the website, products and/or services.</p>

<p>NOTICE TO EUROPEAN USERS<br>
This Site and the services on this Site are targeted for users in the United States of America. Any information you enter on this Site may be transferred outside of the European Union to the United States of America which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union. In particular, you are advised that the United States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. Article 26 of the European Union's Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection. By using this Site or the services, you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union and to the processing of that information by Northstar on its servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
