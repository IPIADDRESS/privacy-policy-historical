<h2>Third Party Websites</h2>
<p>We may link to third party websites, including Facebook using APIs, from our own website.  We have no control over, and are not responsible for, these third party websites or their use of your personal information.  We recommend that you review their privacy policies and other agreements governing your use of their website.</p>
<p>We will also extract information from Facebook about you, and you consent to our use of your Facebook information in order to provide our service to you.</p>
<h2>Third Party Access to Your Information</h2>
<p>We protect your information from being accessed by third parties.  However, since we may employ outside maintenance personnel or use a third party to host our material, there are third party entities which may have custody or access to your information.  Because of this, it is necessary that you permit us to give access to your information to third parties to the same extent that you authorize us to do so.  For greater certainty, every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or systems.  You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.</p>
<h2>Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>We may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter.  In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either.</p>
<h2>Security of Information</h2>
<p>We use SSL certificates to help secure our website.  However, we make no representations as to the security or privacy of your information.  It is in our interest to keep our website secure, but we recommend that you use anti-virus software, firewalls, and other precautions to protect yourself from security threats.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that we are a separate website from Facebook and you must ensure your security on both sites in order to keep your information secure.  Any comments about your privacy or security relating to your Facebook account should be directed to Facebook rather than us.</p>
<h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
