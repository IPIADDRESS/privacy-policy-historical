<h4>Embedded media from other websites</h4>
<p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>
<p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>
<a name="third"></a>
<h2 class="sub">4. Third party services</h2>
<p>This section of our Privacy Policy details any third party services we use on our website, the reason we use them, and the information these third party services collect.</p>
<a name="ga"></a>
<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
<p>The best way we have for knowing how well we're doing is by the number of visitors our website receives. To learn this information, we use Google Analytics, a free service provided by Google. Google Analytics tracks information such as the number of visitors that each page on our site receives, the general location of our visitors, the number of pages viewed by a visitor, and the amount of time a visitor spent on our site.</p>
<p>Google Analytics does not track any PII (Personally Identifiable Information) about you as a user. It provides only generalized information.</p>
<p>As a user of Google Analytics, we do not (and will not allow any third party to) use Google Analytics to track, collect or upload any data that personally identifies an individual (such as a name, email address or billing information), or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information by Google. We include this page to outline our Privacy Policy and we comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to the collection of information from visitors.</p>
<p>Google Analytics uses cookies. To learn more about cookies and how to control and disable cookies in your web browser, please visit the <a href="https://cookies.insites.com/" target="_blank" title="Learn more">Cookies and You</a> website.</p>
<a name="adsense"></a>
<h3>Google AdSense</h3>
<p>Photoshop Essentials.com is provided as a free service to our visitors. To help monetize our website, we use Google AdSense to display ads. Some of the advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons to send these advertisers information about you, including your IP address, your Internet Service Provider, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or for showing certain ads based on other sites you've visited (such as showing gardening ads to someone who frequents gardening websites).</p>
<h4>DoubleClick DART cookies</h4>
<p>We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (for example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. To learn more, visit the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx" target="_blank" title="Learn more">DoubleClick</a> website.
</p><h4>Personalized vs Non-Personalized ads</h4>
There are two main types of ads that Google AdSense can display;personalized ads and non-personalized ads. Personalized ads are more useful to you because they're based on your interests, demographics and other criteria. Personalized ads use cookies to provide advertisers with this information. Non-personalized ads are less useful because they are based only on the content of the web page you're visiting. While non-personalized ads still use cookies to allow for frequency capping, aggregated ad reporting, and to combat fraud and abuse, they do not track any personally identifiable information about you.
<h4>Privacy Policy update for EU visitors (May 25, 2018)</h4>
<p>To comply with the new GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), as of May 25, 2018, Photoshop Essentials.com will allow Google AdSense to display only non-personalized ads for our visitors in the EU. Changes to this policy, if any, will be updated on this page.</p>
