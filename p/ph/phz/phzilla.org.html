			<span class="c2">Cookies Information. When you visit the Sites or use our Services, one or more cookies, web beacons, or action tags may be sent to your computer or otherwise used in connection with your visit or use.

We also use the information collected and stored by cookies to help us provide you with personalized features and preferences when using our Services in a manner that is linked to personal user information you elect to share with us. We use action tags to compile statistics and other data about our users on an aggregate basis.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">

However, some features and services may not function properly without cookies.</span>

Some of these third party advertising networks are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and subject to the NAI Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Preference Marketing by Network Advertisers, available atwww.networkadvertising.org (the "NAI Principles"). If you would like to opt-out from these services from NAI members, you may go to the NAI Non-PII Opt-Out Page, located at </span><span class="c2 c8"><a class="c5" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a></span><span class="c2">, or the opt-out page of the particular third party advertising network identified in the cookie.</span>

Occasionally, we engage third parties to provide us with products and services, such as support, consulting, statistical analysis, and marketing research that may require access to or use of your personal information.

		<p class="c3">
			<span class="c4">4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Business Transfers. Information about our users and the access and use of the obandiproductions Sites and our products and services is one of our most important business assets.

In general, clicking on third party links on the Sites, whether part of a search result, advertisement, or other content, will allow the third party provider of the result, link, or content to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information about your browser and activity. We encourage you to be aware when you click on a link or visit a Third Party Property or otherwise leave our Sites, to review any such third party's data and information collection and use practices and policies with regard to their web site, products, or services.</span>
