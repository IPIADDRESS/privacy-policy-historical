        <h4>The Site and Third Party Sites</h4>
        This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Site. The Site may contain links to third party sites that are not owned or controlled by the Owner. The Owner has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party site. You agree that You are responsible for reviewing and understanding the privacy policies (if any) of any third party sites You may access through this Site. By using this Site, You release the Owner from any and all liability arising from Your use of any third party site to which this Site may be linked.
        <br>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve the Site and the related features, to administer Your subscription and to enable Users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site. Below are the types and categories of information that we collect.
        
        <h4>Personal Information Collected</h4>
        We collect Your personal information in the following ways:
        
        <h4>Account</h4>
        In order to become a User, You do not need to create an account on our Site. However, in order to access some features of the services or other elements of the Site, You will have to create Your account. When creating your account You benefit from number of different services we provide to help You take advantage of our unique approach to Your needs and expectations about movies. In this respect You are required to provide the following contact information, which You recognize and expressly acknowledge is personal information allowing others, including the Owner, to identify You: email address, username and a password chosen by You. It is important that You must keep Your account password secure and confidential.
        
        <h4>Log Data</h4>
        When You visit the Site or use the Site, whether as a Site subscriber or a non-registered User just browsing our servers the Owner automatically records information about Your use of the Site and Your visit to the Site ("Log Data"). The Log Data may include information such as Your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, Your browser type, what software You were using, the web page You were visiting immediately prior to visiting our Site, pages of our Site that You visited, the time spent on those pages, information You searched for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and for the Site's technical administration, to improve our Site's functionality and User-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our Users' needs. We also use this information to verify that Users of the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests.
        
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        Like most sites, the Site uses cookies and web log files to track the Site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on Your computer which allows the Site to recognize You as a User when You return to the Site using the same computer and web browser. If Your browser settings do not allow cookies, You will not be able to use the Site. Like the information You enter at registration, cookie and log file data is used to customize Your experience on our Site.
        <br>One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once You’ve logged in to Your account. The next time You visit the Site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize You as an existing User so You will not need to log in before using the Site.
        <br>Additionally, if You log out of the Site You will need to re-enter Your password the next time You visit in order to log in to Your account. Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when You close Your web browser.
        <br>We use cookies to improve the quality of our Site by storing User preferences and tracking User trends. In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing Sites to our Users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on Your browser. Any information provided to third parties through such cookies will not be personally identifiable. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but You can reset Your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Unfortunately, if Your browser settings do not allow cookies or You opt to refuse all cookies, You may not be able to use the Site or services. The Owner does not store personally identifiable information in the cookies.
        
        <h4>Web Beacons</h4>
        We allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.
        <br>To deliver these ads properly, the Site may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by the Site so the networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to You while You visit other sites.
        <br>Because Your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if You had requested a web page from their site.
        <br>These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other sites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. The Owner does not provide personally identifiable information to any advertiser or any other third party.
        
        <h4>Log files, IP addresses and information about Your computer</h4>
        Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when You visit the Site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which You came and the site to which You are going when You leave the Site. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of Your computer (or the proxy server You use to access the World Wide Web), Your computer operating system and type of web browser You are using, email patterns, as well as the name of Your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Site. The linkage between Your IP address and Your personally identifiable information is not shared with third-parties without Your permission or except when required by law.
        
        <h4>Communications</h4>
        The Owner will communicate with You through email and notices posted on the Site or through other means available through the Site, including text and other forms of messaging. The Owner may use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of material Site changes or for Users service purposes). If we send any communications to You via the carrier service with which You have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, You understand You will pay any service fees associated with any such access (including text messaging charges for messages to Your mobile device). Please be aware that You will always receive certain emails from the Owner related to the proper functioning of Your account. You can change Your e-mail and contact preferences at any time by logging into Your account and amending Your email notification choices.
        
        <h4>Sharing Information with Third Parties</h4>
        The Owner takes the privacy of Users very seriously. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide Your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes. We will only share Your personally identifiable information with third parties to carry out Your instructions or to provide specific services or information. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and they are bound by confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.
        <br>We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of our Sites to third parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on the Site.
        
        <h4>Teaming with Other Organizations to Offer Combined and Other Sites</h4>
        The Owner may offer the Site in connection with other sites (including updates about the Site) or may team with other online services to give You the combined results of both services or additional services and benefits. Platform Applications can be designed by Platform Developers or by a subset of Platform Developers with whom the Owner has more closely aligned (“Partners”).
        <br>In the case of Partners, we do some vetting and we only work with trusted Partners. Because of Owner’s trust in these Partners, Platform Applications or services designed by a Partner may be automatically granted permission to access account information to provide the combined services.
        <br>For Platform Applications designed by most Platform Developers, You will be asked to confirm acceptance of the Platform Developers’ respective privacy policies and User agreements, which have not necessarily been reviewed or approved by the Owner. In these cases, it will be Your choice whether or not to make use of the services and whether to proceed under the Platform Developers’ terms.
        <br>Platform Developers are required to agree to restrictions on access, storage and usage of Your information.
