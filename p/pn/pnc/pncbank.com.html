We respect the privacy of our customers and are committed to protecting their information on our Web sites with the same care we utilize for all PNC Bank transactions.
<p>
PNC Bank does not automatically collect personal information from visitors to its Web sites.  PNC Bank does use cookies, which are small pieces of information that a Web site stores on a visitor’s web browser to remind the site about the visitor the next 
time they visit the site. PNC Bank does not store confidential or sensitive information in cookies.  PNC Bank uses cookies to enhance our customers’ online banking session by making navigation easier.  For certain applications, such as  Online Banking, cookies are a requirement because they help protect the privacy of a customer’s transactions by, for example, automatically terminating the online session if the customer forgets to log out.
</p><p>
Cookies cannot be used to capture your e-mail address, obtain data from your hard drive or gain confidential or sensitive information about you.  Additionally, cookies cannot be read by a Web site other than the one that set the cookie.  Some Web sites, however, use cookies to obtain information from your browser. You can set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie, so that you can control whether you accept or reject a cookie.  Please click on

<b>PNC Bank Customer Information Privacy Principles</b>
</p><p>
At PNC Bank, our mission is to meet the desires of our customers.  As financial services professionals entrusted with sensitive financial information, we respect the privacy of our customers and are committed to treating customer information responsibly. 
Our Customer Information Privacy Principles serve as standards for all PNC Bank employees for collection, use, retention, and security of individual customer information. 
</p><ul>
<p>
</p><li><b>PNC Bank Collects and Retains Only Customer Information That Is Needed</b>
<p></p><ul>
We limit the amount and type of customer information we collect and retain to that which is required to establish and manage customer accounts, understand customer needs, provide customer services, offer new products and services, and comply with legal and
regulatory requirements.</ul>
<p>
</p></li><li><b>PNC Bank Employees Are Responsible For Customer Information Protection</b><p>
</p><ul>
We limit employee access to customer information to those employees with a legitimate business need for the information.  We have policies, procedures, employee orientation, and communication programs designed for the protection of customer information.  
It is the responsibility of each PNC Bank employee to comply with our Customer Information Privacy Principles policies and procedures.  Failure to comply subjects our employees to disciplinary action.
</ul><p>
</p></li><li><b>PNC Bank Strives To Maintain The Accuracy Of Customer Information</b>
<p></p><ul>
We have implemented internal controls and procedures designed to keep and report customer information as accurately and completely as possible.  We respond promptly when a customer tells us his or her information is not accurate.
<p></p></ul>
</li><li><b>PNC Bank Limits The Internal Disclosure Of Customer Information</b><p>
</p><ul>
Before we share non-transactional personal information, such as applications, financial statements, and credit reports, among PNC Bank companies, we provide our consumer customers the opportunity to opt-out of such inter-company information sharing, except where such information is used to enable one PNC company to service customer accounts for another.
<p></p></ul>
</li><li><b>PNC Bank Limits The External Disclosure Of Customer Information</b><p>
	We do not disclose customer information outside the PNC Bank companies, except:
</p><ul>
<li>to conduct our business (for example, in connection with completing  customer transactions,  transferring customer accounts, or sharing information with credit reporting agencies, persons verifying account status, or persons providing services for us),

</li><li>when we suspect fraud or are otherwise required or permitted to do so by law or regulation,

</li><li>when a customer requests or gives us permission to do so, or

</li><li>to make available products or services we believe may be of interest to our customers.  Those companies outside PNC Bank that we select to offer services or products to our customers must agree to respect the privacy of our customer information.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li><b>PNC Bank Respects Our Customers’ Solicitation Preference</b><p>
</p><ul>
We honor our consumer customers’ requests to be excluded from marketing solicitations.
<p></p></ul>
</li><li><b>PNC Bank Provides Our Customers Access To Our Privacy Principles</b><p>
</p><ul>
Our Customer Information Privacy Principles are readily available to our customers through brochures, customer mail, web sites, and toll-free telephone numbers.
<p></p></ul>
</li><li><b>PNC Bank Provides Security Safeguards To Protect Customer Information</b>
<p></p><ul>
We use advanced technology and information management techniques to implement security, audit, and control programs designed to protect customer information.
<p></p></ul>
</li><li><b>PNC Bank Protects Customer Information On Our Web sites</b><p>
</p><ul>
We protect the privacy of customer information sent to and from our web sites.  In addition to the security and privacy standards that are applied to traditional banking transactions, we also use specific controls designed to identify and authenticate all
 our online customers and prevent and detect unauthorized access to our web sites.
</ul>
<br>
For comments and questions or to obtain any updates to these Privacy Principles, please call us at PNC Bank, 1-888-PNCBANK. To request that we exclude you from telemarketing, mail, or on-line marketing solicitations, or to request that we do not share your non-transactional personal information among our family of PNC Bank companies, please write us at PNC Bank, P.O. Box 96066, Pittsburgh, PA 15226. Please include your name, address, PNC Bank account number(s) or social security number.
<br><i><p></p><p></p></i></li></ul><i>
These Privacy Principles are effective as of October 1, 1998 and may be modified from time to
time.</i>
