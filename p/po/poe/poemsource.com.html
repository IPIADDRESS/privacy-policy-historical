</p><h1 style="text-align: center">Poemsource.com Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>In order to place Google AdSense ads on our site, we must have a privacy policy in place. This is our Privacy Policy to comply with Google's requirements.

</p><p>Poemsource.com collects no personal information about you, nor does Poemsource.com place cookies or Web beacons on your site. Poemsource.com does not operate any information gathering technology whatsoever nor gather any personal information. 

</p><p>Of course, if you voluntarily give us your e-mail address or phone number or other contact information with a request to contact you or give us another reason to have that information, then we will possess it and keep it, but we do not collect or take any information from you without your knowledge and consent.

</p><p>The only personal information that Poemsource.com ever collected was e-mail addresses that were voluntarily entered into the form that used to exist on each poem page (but no longer does) to subscribe visitors to our newsletter. We have kept that list but are not adding to it. We would only use those e-mail addresses to notify those already on the list of new poems or other writings we may (or may not) do. We would not use the list for any other purpose, nor would we sell it or reveal it to anyone else for any purpose, unless required to do so by law.

</p><p>However, we use Google AdSense and third-party advertising companies that partner with Google to serve ads when you visit our Web site. Both Google and these Google third-party advertising company partners collect information about your interests by placing and reading cookies on your browser, or using Web beacons to collect information in the course of ads being served on Poemsource.com. Some third-party advertisements provided by Google use the DoubleClick cookie to serve ads to users based on their visits to sites on the Web.  

</p><p>Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable Google and other advertisers to recognize your browser. 

</p><p>A Web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor your journey around a single Web site or collection of sites. They are also referred to as Web bugs and are commonly used by sites that hire third-party services to monitor traffic. They may be used in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with the pages and content on the pages of a Web site.

</p><p>Cookies and Web beacons can enhance your Web surfing experience by presenting ads or information of interest to you based on your browsing history--what sites and pages you've chosen to visit in the past, for example. What they CANNOT do is personally identify you or connect you with the browsing history that they collect from you as you click around the Poemsource.com site and other sites you visit. Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be used to override Web beacons.

</p><p>Google and their third-party advertiser partners may use this information (which does NOT including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to Poemsource.com and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services based on your interests as revealed by your Web browsing history.

</p><p>The DoubleClick cookie is used by Google in the ads served on the Web sites of its partners, such as Web sites displaying AdSense ads  or participating in Google certified ad networks. When users visit the Poemsource.com Web site and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser. The data gathered from these cookies will be used to help provide ads of interest to the visitors to Poemsource.com.

</p><p>You may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">opt-out page</a>. 

</p><p>You may also opt out of interest-based ads <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="new">at this site</a>.

</p><p><a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/" target="new">Here's more information about how Google uses advertising cookies</a>.

</p><p><a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="new">You can see Google's own Privacy Policy here</a>.  

</p><p>Also, you can set your Internet Explorer browser to delete your browsing history, including cookies, whenever you exit 

</p><p>In addition, you may or may not find the following ad networks serving ads at Poemsource.com:

</p><p><a href="http://www.netseer.com" target="new">NetSeer.com</a>
