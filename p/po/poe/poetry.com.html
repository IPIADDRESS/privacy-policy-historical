<p align="center"><b>PRIVACY POLICY<br>SECURE ORDERING</b></p>

<p>At Poetry.com, we value our customers and respect their privacy.  We collect customer information in
an effort to improve your overall experience and to communicate with you about our products, services,
contests, and promotions.  We recognize that we must maintain and use customer information
responsibly.</p>

<p>We may use information that you provide to tell you about carefully screened products which we feel
may be of interest to you.  Also, we may share our mailing list (your name and physical address) and
your general shopping activity information with a few select companies whose products and services are
similar to ours.  We do this because most of our customers enjoy being introduced to new or value
oriented products/services.  In addition, we sometimes use e-mail addresses to contact visitors who
communicate with us.  For example, we send e-email to visitors who provide us with their e-mail
addresses for specific purposes, such as our regular newsletter with topics of interest relating to poetry,
providing information about promotions, or responding to an inquiry.</p>

<p>Poetry.com may collect usage information when you visit Poetry.com.  Website usage information is not
personally identifiable information.  It describes how our website is used and navigated, including the
number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stay.  It also includes the
domain names of users and browser types that visit our website, the time of day the website was visited,
and other non-personally identifiable information.  All information collected will be used to improve the
shopping experience at Poetry.com.</p>

<p>We also use cookies. A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored in a browser-related file on your
computer's hard drive when you use the Site. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and are
read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Our primary use of cookies is to
improve your experience on our website. For example, storing a cookie on your computer allows you to
login without typing your e-mail address and password each time.</p>

<p>If for any reason you do not wish to receive communications from Poetry.com or from affiliated third-
party merchants, or any interested third parties from whom we think you may want to receive
information, just tell us.  Call us at 410-356-2000, and one of our customer service representatives will
gladly assist you, or contact us through the "contact us" section of this Site.  Also, we provide a direct
link for you to easily opt out of our various e-mail promotions that provide information about the special
opportunities we offer.</p>

<p>Poetry.com takes reasonable precautions to safeguard information transmitted between users and the
websites.  Certain pages of the websites, including those that offer users the opportunity to provide
credit card information for purchases, use Secured Socket Layers (SSL) encryption. However, due to the
inherent nature of the Internet as an open communications network, we cannot guarantee that
communications between you and Poetry.com and information stored on our servers will be free from
unauthorized access.  Users understand and acknowledge this risk when communicating with and
providing information to the Site. <img align="left" src="/include/common/onlineorders/verisign_logo.gif" width="96" height="41" border="0" alt=""> Verisign provides authentication that you are communicating over a
secure connection with Poetry.com.</p>

<p>As Poetry.com continues to explore new business opportunities, it may need to, and reserves the right to
transfer and assign customer contact and Site usage information collected on the Site to one or more
affiliated and unaffiliated entities as part of a business transaction.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about our privacy policy or information security, you can contact
Poetry.com's customer service in any of three ways: 1) call us at 410-356-2000; 2) write to us at
Poetry.com Customer Service, 1 Poetry Plaza, Owings Mills, MD 21117; or 3) send us a message
