            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <hr>
			<br>

            <h2>Privacy is important</h2>
			<p>We recognise that privacy of personal information is important to individuals. 
            Personal information for our business purposes is to be minimal, private, correct, 
            safe and largely in the control of the individual. Except where otherwise legally 
            appropriate we will treat your personal information as private.</p>

            <h2>Your say on your privacy</h2>
            <p>If you have a particular concern or query about your personal information held 
            by us you should contact our Privacy Officer (P.O Box 2196 Richmond South Vic 3121, 
            <a href="mailto:privacyofficer@jjh.com.au">privacyofficer@jjh.com.au</a> - Ph. <span class="phone">1800 333232</span>) 
            whom we have appointed for your assistance.</p>
            
            <h2>The nature of our business</h2>
            <p>We are principally a retailer. Retailing can utilise a number of facilities and 
            functions including shops (off the street and in shopping centres), the Internet, 
            promotional material (using various forms including paper and electronic mail outs), 
            credit and other card systems, layby arrangements and reward schemes. As a successful 
            and long established retailer we carry out any or all of these means of business from time 
            to time. We have built an enviable reputation as one of Australia's largest specialty 
            retailing groups up on servicing our customers.</p>
            
            <h2>Obtaining personal information</h2>
            <p>Because of the nature of our business it is necessary to obtain personal information 
            from time to time. We will however not be unduly intrusive nor obtain or use information 
            in an inappropriate manner. We will only ask for and use personal information we 
            reasonably need to conduct our business. If you have received any promotional material 
            and do not wish to receive it then upon letting us know we will not send it to you.</p>
            
            <p>Our website may use cookies which are small data files that are stored on your 
            computer when you visit a website. They are used on our website to track anonymous 
            traffic data. If our website has online shopping facilities, cookies enable you to 
            shop and may be used to personalise or enhance your online shopping and browsing experience. 
            If you do not enable cookies, you will not be able to shop online on our website.</p>
            
            <h2>Safekeeping and need to know handling</h2>
            <p>As part of us keeping your personal information private we only allow access on 
            a need to know basis.</p>
            
            <h2>Your access and control</h2>
            <p>However, in accordance with the privacy law we give you access to your personal 
            information we hold and you can correct misinformation (except where it would be 
            inappropriate or exempted by law e.g - where it would require disclosing someone 
            else's personal information, but we will provide you with reasons).</p>
            
            <h2>Confidence</h2>
            <p>It is important for us that persons with whom we do business have confidence 
            that we handle information responsibly and it is our policy to do this.</p>
