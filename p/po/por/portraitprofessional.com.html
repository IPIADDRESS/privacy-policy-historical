                  you when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill 
                  a request by you for an online newsletter, or to advise of upgrades

                  that you have purchased.</p>
                <p>The information we collect in connection with our online forums

                  beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page 
                  or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that
