<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
At some Anthropics Technology Ltd sites, you can order and 
download products, upload images and text, vote in polls or 
otherwise express an opinion, or participate in one of our online 
forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable 
information that may be collected at these pages include: name, 
address, e-mail address, credit card information, and information 
about your interests in and use of various products, programs, 
and services.
</p>
<p>
At certain parts of some of our sites, only persons who provide 
us with the requested personally identifiable information will 
be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise 
participate in the site's activities and offerings.
</p>
<p>
We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information 
when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser 
you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox), 
the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows XP 
or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider 
(e.g., AOL, NTL, BTInternet).
</p>

<h2>How We Use the Information</h2>

<p>
We may notify you about new programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about 
our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or 
services that we believe may be of interest to you.
</p>
<p>
We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify 
you when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill 
a request by you for an online newsletter, or to advise of upgrades 
and enhancements that are available for products and service 
that you have purchased.
</p>
<p>
The information we collect in connection with our online forums 
and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. 
We use this information to facilitate participation in these 
online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer 
you products, upgrades or services.
</p>
<p>
If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g. before 
and after pictures, software usage tips), we may publish your 
submitted name and approximate geographical location such as 
country, county or state.
</p>
<p>
We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information 
that we collect to improve the design and content of our site 
and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We 
also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site 
usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, upgrades 
or services.
</p>
<p>
We may disclose personally identifiable information in response 
to legal process, for example, in response to a court order 
or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response 
to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it 
is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding 
illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential 
threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of 
our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, 
we may transfer information about you if we are acquired by 
or merged with another company.
</p>
<p>
Agents and contractors of Anthropics Technology Ltd who have 
access to personally identifiable information are required to 
protect this information in a manner that is consistent with 
this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information 
for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are 
performing for Anthropics Technology Ltd.
</p>
<p>
Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against 
unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you 
that personally identifiable information that we collect will 
never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this 
Privacy Notice.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the Anthropics Technology Ltd sites covered by this 
Privacy Notice will not use or transfer personally identifiable 
information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described 
above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt 
out of these unrelated uses.
