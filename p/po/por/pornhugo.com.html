                <strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Pages of our the Website and our e-mails may contain small electronic
                files known as web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, single-pixel gifs and web bugs) that
                are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the
                online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user’s
                computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the
                size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with
                cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages or opened an e-mail, to understand usage patterns
                and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website
                content and verifying system and server integrity). We also may receive an anonymous identification
                number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.

                certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses, device and software identifiers,
                referring and exit URLs, onsite behavior and usage information, feature use metrics and statistics,
                usage and purchase history, media access control address (MAC Address), mobile unique device ID, and
                other similar information. The third party analytics companies who collect information on our Website
                and other online products or services may combine the information collected with other information they
                have independently collected from other websites or other online or mobile products and services
                relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online or mobile products and

                evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and

                not be able to use the full functionality of this website. Furthermore you can prevent Google’s

            <li>You may, at any time, update, correct, or delete certain personal information that you have provided to
                us by updating your preferences on the Account Settings page or by contacting us at the email address

                When you register on our Website you may be given a choice as to whether you want to receive email
                messages and/or newsletters about product updates, improvements, special offers, or containing special
                distributions of content by us. At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or
                promotional emails or newsletters from us by clicking on the following link and entering the email
                address associated with your account: <a href="/login">LOGIN
                    HERE</a>. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to
                opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 7 days for us to process an opt-out
                request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as
                service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt
                out of receiving them. Please note that, changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out
                of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from
                us. If we have already provided your information to a third party before you have changed your
                preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third
                party.
            </li>
            <li>If you submit personal information, you may delete your account with us at any time. If you delete your
                account, your personal information and any and all other account related information including, but not
                limited to, user profile data, sharing data and any other data, or content specifically associated with
                your account are also permanently deleted. Deletion of your data may take up to 30 days from accessible
                systems and up to 90 days from backup systems. If you choose to have an account with us in the future,
                you will have to sign up for a new account as none of the information you previously provided or saved
                within your account will have been saved.
            </li>
            <li>You can disable the location services on your mobile device or tablet. Most likely, these controls are
                located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to disable your device's location
                services, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.

        <strong class="heading">How We Protect Your Personal Information</strong>
        <br><br>
        We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard
        your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are
        permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition,
        we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and
        we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
        The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have
        chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password
        confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out
        information in public areas of the Website like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be
        viewed by any user of the Website.
        We want you to feel confident using our Website. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore,
        although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your
        personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care
        with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information
        through insecure email. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures
        contained on the Website.

        <br><br>
        <strong class="heading">User Contributions</strong>
        <br><br>
        We may provide areas on our Website where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate
        with others; upload content (e.g., pictures, videos, audio files, etc.); and post comments or reviews of content
        found on the Website. Such postings are governed by our terms of use found at <a href="/terms-and-conditions">Terms and Conditions</a>. If you
        use a forum, blog, channel, bulletin board, chat room, user commenting features, or other interactive sharing or
        social features that may be offered through our Website, you should be aware that any personal information you
        submit, display, or publish there is considered publicly available and can be read, collected, used, and
        disclosed by other users of those features, by us, and other third parties without restriction, except to the
        extent limited access features are available, if any. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or
        when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. If you post your email address, you may receive
        unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information
        you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal
        information. Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information. To
        request removal of your personal information from our blog, sharing service or community forum, for example,
        contact us at the information provided in this privacy policy. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your
        personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
        <br><br>
