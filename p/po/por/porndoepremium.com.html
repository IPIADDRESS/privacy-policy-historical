            <strong>Cookies (or browser cookies).</strong> Cookies are small text files that are stored in your web
            browser or downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the
            originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies
            are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device. Cookies might be used for the
            following purposes: (1) to enable certain functions; (2) to provide analytics; (3) to store your
            preferences; and (4) to enable ad delivery and behavioral advertising.
            We currently use the following types of cookies:
            <ul style="padding-left: 15px; list-style: disc; list-style-position: inside;">
                <li><span style="font-style=italic;">Cookies that are strictly necessary:</span> These are cookies

                    access to a particular service or Content.
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Analytical cookies:</span> These cookies allow us to recognize

                </li>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Targeting cookies:</span> These cookies record the visit of a
                    user on our Website, the pages a user has visited and the links a user has followed in order to
                    enable us to make our Website more relevant to the users’ interests. Also, these cookies are
                    used to identify the websites and the marketing materials you are accessing our Website from in
                    order to target content (for example, to automatically show you our Website according to your
                    language settings).
                </li>
            </ul>
            We do not require that you accept cookies and you may withdraw your consent to our use of cookies at any
            time by adjusting your browser’s privacy settings. However, if you decline to accept cookies, some
            functionality on our Website may be disabled and you may be unable to access certain parts of our
            Website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will
            issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Website. Cookies can either be session cookies or
            persistent cookies. A session cookie expires automatically when you close your browser. A persistent
            cookie will remain until it expires or you delete your cookies. Expiration dates are set in the cookies
            themselves; some may expire after a few minutes while others may expire after multiple years.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Flash Cookies.</strong> Certain features of our Website may use local stored objects (or Flash
            cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on our
            Website. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies. For
            information about managing your privacy and security settings for Flash cookies, see “<span style="font-style: italic;" data-action="scroll-to" data-target="#disclosure-of-information">Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</span>”.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Pages of our the Website and our e-mails may contain small electronic
            files known as web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, single-pixel gifs and web bugs) that
            are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the
            online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user’s
            computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the
            size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with
            cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages or opened an e-mail, to understand usage patterns
            and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website
            content and verifying system and server integrity). We also may receive an anonymous identification
            number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Analytics Tools.</strong> We use analytics tools and other third party technologies, such as
            Google Analytics and DoubleClick Cookies, to collect non-personal information in the form of various
            usage and user metrics when you use our Website. These tools and technologies collect and analyze
            certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses, device and software identifiers,
            referring and exit URLs, onsite behavior and usage information, feature use metrics and statistics,
            usage and purchase history, media access control address (MAC Address), mobile unique device ID, and
            other similar information. The third party analytics companies who collect information on our Website
            and other online products or services may combine the information collected with other information they
            have independently collected from other websites or other online or mobile products and services
            relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online or mobile products and
            services. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. In
            addition to our use of technologies as described herein, we may permit certain third party companies to
            help us tailor advertising that we think may be of interest to you based on your use of our Website and
            to otherwise collect and use data about your use of our Website. For more information about this
            practice, please see the “Third Party Advertising Technologies” section below. You may opt out of the
            DoubleClick cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/" target="_blank">Google advertising opt-out page</a> or you may opt
            out of Google Analytics by visiting the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Google Analytics opt-out page</a>.
            This Website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google
            Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how
            users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including
            your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of
            activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for
            Germany. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in
            the USA. On behalf of the website provider Google will use this information for the purpose of
            evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and
            providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website provider. Google

    <h2>How We Protect Your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
        <br>
        The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.
        <br>
        We want you to feel confident using our Website. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.
