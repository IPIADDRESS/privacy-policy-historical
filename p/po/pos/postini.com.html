                <em><strong>What Is Covered by This Section?</strong></em> The paragraphs in this section
                  describe how Postini uses and disseminates information collected
                  about Public Website Visitors through our Public Website,
                  which includes the portions of our website that are publicly
                  available without a password. It does not cover any other
              data processing activities. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Your Use of the Public Website Implies Consent.</em></strong> Your use of
                the Public Website signifies your acceptance of this Privacy
                Statement. If you do not agree or are not comfortable with any
                policy described in this Privacy Statement, your remedies are
                to discontinue your use of the Public Website or to follow the
                other instructions described elsewhere in this Privacy Statement. </p>
              <p><strong><em>If You Don't Volunteer Any Personal Data, We Won't
                  Collect Any Through the Public Website.</em></strong> We use cookies and various traffic
                tracking technologies to monitor the use of our Public Website.
                We collect such data related to IP addresses but do not link
                it to any personally identifiable information (such as names
                and email addresses) that you may voluntarily submit to us through
                other means (except as described below, in "Agents and
                Service Providers"). </p>
              <p><strong><em>Agents and Service Providers.</em></strong> We engage data processing agents
                and service providers that assist us in the processing of personally
                identifiable information that Public Website Visitors may volunteer
                through the Public Website, as well as electronic messages and
                traffic data that is linked to IP addresses. Such third parties
                process data only on our behalf and are contractually obligated
                to refrain from using such data for their own purposes. For
                those of our Public Website visitors, who either (i) submit
                inquiries to us via Web Forms or (ii) have been directed to
                our Public Website after clicking on a link in marketing email
                from us, we use software from a company called Eloqua Corporation
                to connect such information submitted to us (such as email addresses
                and contact information) with the IP address and cookie on the
                computer that has submitted the information to us (see "Use
                of Cookies" below for a further description of cookies).
                Each time such visitors visit our Public Website after they
                have submitted a Web Form to us or clicked on a particular link
                in a marketing email from us, we maintain a record of certain
                information about their visit including the pages viewed on
                our Public Website, the time of the visit, the order of pages
                accessed and the amount of time such visitors spend at each
                page. We use this information to better tailor our services
                to our visitors. If you would prefer that we not link your personally
                identifiable information with data from your visits to our Public
                Website you have several options: (i) not submit your information
                to us via Web Form or click on a link to our Public Website
                in a marketing email from us, (ii) let us know via email that
                you would prefer to opt out, (iii) visit <a href="/optstatus.php">http://www.postini.com/optstatus.php</a>                and opt out of web monitoring via use of Eloqua software on
                our Public Website (iv) visit <a href="http://www.eloqua.com/privacy/optstatus.asp" target="_blank">http://www.eloqua.com/privacy/optstatus.asp</a>                and globally opt out of all web monitoring via use of Eloqua
                software, or (v) disable cookies in your web browser. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Use of Cookies.</em></strong> A cookie is a small text file containing information
                that a web browser transfers to your computer's hard disk for
                record-keeping purposes. On the Public Website, we may use cookies
                to analyze our site traffic patterns, but, except as described
                above, we link cookies only to IP addresses and not any personally
                identifiable information about Public Website Visitors (such
                as names or email addresses). For example, we currently use
                third party web tracking software to analyze traffic to the

                not in the business of selling, renting or loaning personally
                identifiable information to independent third parties. </p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Postini may have to disclose information to third
                parties when required by law or under the good-faith belief
                that such disclosure is necessary in order to conform to applicable
                law, comply with legal process served on Postini, or to protect
                the property or interests of Postini, its agents and employees,
                or the personal safety of others, or the public. Under such
                circumstances, Postini may be prohibited by law, court order
                or other legal process from providing notice of the disclosure,
                and Postini reserves the right to not provide such notice in
                its sole discretion. </p>
              <p>As its business evolves, Postini may sell, transfer or otherwise
                share some or all of its assets, including personally identifiable
                information, in connection with a merger, reorganization, or
                sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. If in any such
                event, personal information is one of the assets transferred,
                we will provide notice as described in the paragraph "How
                Will We Notify You of Changes?" above. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Links to Other Sites.</em></strong> The Public Website may contain links

              <p><strong><em>What Is Covered by This Section?</em></strong> The paragraphs in this section
                provide information on how Postini uses and disseminates information
                collected about End Users of the Postini service through password-protected
                portions of our website, such as the Postini Portal, the Administration
                Console and the Message Center. It does not cover any other
                data processing activities. In the password-protected portions
              of our website, we observe the following privacy practices: 
              </p><p><strong><em>Personal Information About End Users is Supplied to
                  Postini by their Email Service Providers.</em></strong> Postini does not require End
                Users to provide personal contact or demographic information.
                The only information Postini obtains about an End User is the
                End User's email address and the End User's configuration settings,
                as well as certain information in electronic messages (such
                as email messages or instant messages) that are or may be linked
                to End Users (collectively, "End User-specific information").
                Information about an End User's email address is provided to
                Postini as a result of our customer relationship with the End
                User's email service provider. This information, as well as
                all the other data that Postini obtains about End Users, is
                controlled by the email service provider, not Postini. As such,
                if an End User wishes to correct or update his or her email
                address, the End User must contact his or her email service
                provider directly. </p>
              <p><strong><em>End User Control of Configuration Settings.</em></strong> If you are an End
                User of Postini services, and you wish to access your Message
                Center Account or adjust the application of the electronic message
                filtering solution to your account, you should follow the instructions
                provided by your email service provider. In addition, if you
                need to update or change the email address or other data that
                Postini may maintain about you, you should contact your email
                service provider for such changes. In turn, the email service
                provider will generally update the information that it provides
                to Postini for purposes of delivering the electronic message
                filtering services. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Passwords and Message Content.</em></strong> To log in to the Message Center
                for the first time, an End User must use the password provided
                by Postini, which is automatically generated. This password
                is not released to any party other than authorized personnel
                of the End User's email service provider, except as described
                herein. After the End User logs in for the first time, the End
                User will be prompted to enter a personalized, secret password.
                This password is not released to any other party. End User configuration
                settings and electronic messages are processed automatically
                by Postini's software, and humans do not review this information
                except as required by law or with the consent of the End User's
                email service provider. All End User-specific information, and
                electronic message information, including content, addresses,
                categorizations, and IP addresses, is kept confidential. Postini
                delivers its services in compliance with the existing service
                agreement between Postini and the End User's email service provider
                (and <br>
                End Users derive no legal rights from such agreements). </p>
              <p><a name="OLE_LINK1"></a><a name="OLE_LINK2" class="style1"></a>
                Contact Update. Our customers designate administrators with
                respect to the Postini service. These designated administrators
                may review and edit the contact information for their company
                directly by using the Contact Update feature, which is available
              in the <a href="/support/support_login.php">Postini Support Portal</a>. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Email Communications.</em></strong> For End Users with direct access to the
                quarantine area of the Message Center, Postini will provide
                email notification when emails with viruses and other email
                are quarantined in the Message Center on a schedule that may
                be determined by the End User or his or her email service provider.
                Generally an End User may not opt-out of these types of emails
                as they are necessary to provide the requested service and are
                not promotional in nature. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Use of Cookies.</em></strong> Postini uses cookies to store the name, email
                addresses, and configuration settings of End Users for session
                management. Other than name, email address and configuration
                settings, these cookies do NOT hold any personal information. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Framed Environments.</em></strong> If an End User's email service provider
                displays the Message Center in a "framed" environment,
                Postini cannot guarantee the privacy practices of that email
                service provider. In this case, the End User must contact his
                or her email service provider directly to obtain information
              about the privacy policies of his or her email service provider.</p>

              <p><strong><em>Business Contacts.</em></strong> Postini may obtain various types of EU Personal

                and email addresses); information about products and services
                ordered or provided; financial and payment information; and
                other transaction-related data. </p>
              <p>Postini may use these types of EU Personal Data for legitimate
                business purposes, including to deliver or provide products
                or services; to establish or maintain customer and business
                relationships; to perform accounting functions; and to conduct
                other activities as necessary or appropriate in connection with
                the servicing and development of the business relationship. </p>
              <p>Business Contacts should email or otherwise contact Postini
                if any of their EU Personal Data changes, or if they would like
                to access and correct or remove EU Personal Data that Postini
                may maintain about them. In many instances, such access may
                be obtained through the newsletter updates and comparable procedures
                described in the section "Public Website Privacy" above.
                All access requests will be responded to within 30 business
                days of receipt. For other requests, Business Contacts may contact
                Postini as explained at the end of this EU Safe Harbor Privacy
                Statement. Also, to the extent that any Business Contacts receive
                marketing and or customer support communications from Postini,
                and wish to unsubscribe or otherwise stop receiving such communications,
                they can follow the instructions in such communications to unsubscribe. </p>
              <p><strong><em>EU Emailers.</em></strong> Postini provides a wide variety of services to
                its customers that facilitate the detection and filtering of
                spam and other unwanted emails, the filtering of electronic
                messages and the archiving of electronic messages. In the course
                of providing these services, Postini may obtain access to EU
                Personal Data about EU Emailers referenced in electronic messages
                covered by the services. Such data may include name and email
                address, and other information in the electronic messages covered
                by the services. Wherever Postini obtains or otherwise processes
                EU Personal Data about an EU Emailer, Postini acts as a mere
                data processor on behalf of its customer (the email service
                provider to the End User of the Postini service). The email
                service provider is the controller of the EU Personal Data,
                and Postini therefore processes such data strictly in accordance
                with the email service provider's instructions and pursuant
                to its contractual arrangements with the email service provider
                as Postini's customer. </p>
              <p>If you are an End User of Postini services, and you wish to
                access your Message Center Account or adjust the application
                of the electronic message filtering solution to your email account,
                you should follow the instructions provided by your email service
                provider. In addition, if you need to update, change or remove
                the email address or other EU Personal Data that Postini may
                maintain about you, you should contact your email service provider
                for such changes. In turn, the email service provider will generally
                update the information that it provides to Postini for purposes
                of delivering the email filtering services. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Other Necessary Disclosures.</em></strong> Postini may disclose EU Personal
                Data to processors, or agents, as necessary in connection with
                the performance of requested services or solutions, or as otherwise
                appropriate in connection with a legitimate business need. Postini
                may also disclose EU Personal Data as necessary and legally
                permissible in connection with the sale or transfer of all or
                part of the business. In these situations, Postini will require
                the recipient of the data to protect the data in accordance
                with the relevant principles in the EU Safe Harbor, including
                providing appropriate notice to EU users, or otherwise take
                steps to ensure that the EU Personal Data is appropriately protected.
                Postini may also disclose EU Personal Data where required or
                permitted by law, or where Postini believes that such disclosures
                are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement request. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Data Security and Integrity.</em></strong> Postini takes reasonable precautions
                to protect EU Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized
                access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Also, to the
                extent necessary or appropriate consistent with its role as
                a mere data processor, Postini makes reasonable efforts to keep
                EU Personal Data reliable for its intended use, accurate, current,
                and complete. </p>
