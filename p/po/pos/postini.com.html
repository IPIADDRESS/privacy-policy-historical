<p><b>Effective October 8, 2004 </b>
</p><p><b><u>Overview </u></b>
</p><p><b><i>What Is Covered in this Privacy Statement? </i></b>This Privacy 
Statement contains information on how Postini, Inc. (“Postini” or “we”) 
processes certain categories of data relating to individual persons. 
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>If you are a visitor to the portions of our website, www.postini.com, that 
can be accessed without a password (our “Public Website”), please see the 
section “Public Website Privacy” below for a comprehensive description of our 
data processing practices with respect to data about you. We refer to you as a 
“Public Website Visitor” in this Privacy Statement. 
<p></p>
</li><li>If you are an end user of Postini® services, please see the section “Service 
End User Privacy” below for information on our data processing practices with 
respect to data about you. For additional information, please contact the email 
service provider that contracts with us for the Postini service, which in most 
cases will be your employer or your Internet Service Provider. We refer to you 
as an “End User” in this Privacy Statement. 
<p></p>
</li><li>If you are a resident of any European Union Member State, please also see 
the section “EU Safe Harbor Privacy Statement” below for a comprehensive 
description of our data processing practices with respect to data about you in 
reference to the EU Safe Harbor Principles. We refer to data relating to you as 
an identifiable individual as “EU Personal Data.” </li></ul><b><i>What Is Not 
Covered in this Privacy Statement? </i></b>We cover only our data processing 
practices described in the preceding paragraph. Without limitation, this Privacy 
Statement does not cover data that we collect offline, on businesses or legal 
entities or on our employees. 
<p><b><i>How Can You Contact Us? </i></b>If you have questions or concerns 
regarding this Privacy Statement, you should first contact us by email at 
webmaster@postini.com. You can also write to Postini at 510 Veterans Boulevard, 
Redwood City, CA 94063, Attention: Information Security Administrator. Postini 
will respond to personal information change requests within 30 days of receiving 
such requests.<b></b> 
</p><p><b><i>What If You Do Not Get A Satisfactory Response? </i></b>We will try our 
best to see that you will always get a satisfactory response from us. As part of 
this effort, we also offer you recourse to TRUSTe®, an independent, nonprofit 
organization dedicated to enabling individuals and organizations to establish 
trusting relationships based on respect for personal identity and information in 
the evolving networked world. Postini is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy 
Program. TRUSTe’s certification covers the gathering and dissemination of 
information described in this Privacy Statement, but not any of our other data 
processing practices. If you do not receive an acknowledgment of an inquiry sent 
to Postini, or if your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you may 
then contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Postini to resolve your concerns. 
</p><p><b><i>How Will We Notify You of Changes? </i></b>We reserve the right to make 
changes to this Privacy Statement. If we make any material changes in our data 
processing practices described herein that significantly affect your privacy, we 
will post a prominent notice on the Public Website notifying you of the change 
30 days before the change takes effect. In some cases where we post such a 
notice, we may also send an email to you. 
</p><p><b><u>Public Website Privacy </u></b>
</p><p><b><i>What Is Covered by This Section? </i></b>The paragraphs in this section 
describe how Postini uses and disseminates information collected about Public 
Website Visitors through our Public Website, which includes the portions of our 
website that are publicly available without a password. It does not cover any 
other data processing activities.
</p><p><b><i>Your Use of the Public Website Implies Consent.</i></b><b> </b>Your 
use of the Public Website signifies your acceptance of this Privacy Statement. 
If you do not agree or are not comfortable with any policy described in this 
Privacy Statement, your remedies are to discontinue your use of the Public 
Website or to follow the other instructions described elsewhere in this Privacy 
Statement. 
</p><p><b><i>If You Don’t Volunteer Any Personal Data, We Won’t Collect Any Through 
the Public Website.</i></b> We use cookies and various traffic tracking 
technologies to monitor the use of our Public Website. We collect such data 
related to IP addresses but do not link it to any personally identifiable 
information ( such as<i></i> names and email addresses) that you may voluntarily 
submit to us through other means. 
</p><p><b><i>Use of Cookies.</i></b><b> </b>A cookie is a small text file 
containing information that a web browser transfers to your computer's hard disk 
for record-keeping purposes. On the Public Website, we may use cookies to 
analyze our site traffic patterns, but we link cookies only to IP addresses and 
not any personally identifiable information about Public Website Visitors (such 
as names or email addresses). For example, we currently use WebTrends Live web tracking software to analyze traffic to the Public Website.  Unlike some web tracking software, the software used by Postini does not have a database of individual profiles for each visitor.  This software uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information, and links cookies only to IP addresses and aggregate data about the traffic to the Public Website.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. Please consult your browser's manual or online help if you want information on 
restricting or disabling the browser's handling of cookies. If you disable 
cookies, you can still view the Public Website, but some features may not be 
available and you may not be able to take advantage of offers or activities 
regarding online registration, which includes online sales. 
</p><p><b><i>Volunteered Information Collected on the Public Website.</i></b><b> 
</b>Public Website Visitors may contact us in a variety of ways, including, 
without limitation, by completing the Web Forms described in the table below. 
Contact information, such as name, address, email addresses and/or phone number, 
is typically provided when using these methods. This information is used to 
provide the services that are requested by the Public Website Visitor. To 
update, correct or remove his or her contact information (for example, to 
unsubscribe), a Public Website Visitor must follow the directions in the table 
below:

</p><p>If you do not wish to submit the personal information requested by these 
forms, you may call us at 888.584.3150 or 650.216.3574. 
</p><p>Postini also allows Public Website Visitors to contact us by email with 
questions, comments or requests. The information collected from these emails is 
used to reply to such questions, comments, or requests. Sometimes we file 
visitor’s comments, so that we can improve the Public Website in the future. A 
small sample of visitors to the Public Website who contact us may be invited to 
participate in usability studies. 
</p><p><b><i>Agents and Service Providers.</i></b> We engage data processing agents 
and service providers that assist us in the processing of personally 
identifiable information that Public Website Visitors may volunteer through the 
Public Website, as well as traffic data that is linked only to IP addresses. 
Such third parties process data only on our behalf and are contractually 
obligated to refrain from using such data for their own purposes. Currently, we 
engage providers that describe their services at www.salesforce.com, 
www.webtrendslive.com and www.surveymonkey.com. 
</p><p><b><i>Disclosure to Third Parties.</i></b> <b></b>In the course of our 
normal business activities, we do not share personally identifiable data about 
Public Website Visitors with any independent third parties, except with agents 
and service providers as described in the preceding paragraph “Agents and 
Service Providers.” In particular, we are not in the business of selling, 
renting or loaning personally identifiable information to independent third 
parties. 
</p><p>Nevertheless, Postini may have to disclose information to third parties when 
required by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary 
in order to conform to applicable law, comply with legal process served on 
Postini, or to protect the property or interests of Postini, its agents and 
employees, or the personal safety of others, or the public. Under such 
circumstances, Postini may be prohibited by law, court order or other legal 
process from providing notice of the disclosure, and Postini reserves the right 
to not provide such notice in its sole discretion. 
</p><p>As its business evolves, Postini may sell, transfer or otherwise share some 
or all of its assets, including personally identifiable information, in 
connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of 
bankruptcy. If in any such an event, personal information is one of the assets 
transferred, we will provide notice as described in the paragraph “How Will We 
Notify You of Changes?” above.
</p><p><b><i>Links to Other Sites.</i></b><b> </b>The Public Website may contain 
links to other sites, including under the “News and Events” and “Postini 
Resource Center” sections of the Public Website. Postini is not responsible for 
the privacy practices of any sites other than its own. This section on “Public 
Website Privacy” applies only to information collected by Postini on the Public 
Website. 
</p><p><i><b>Security of Data.</b></i> Postini treats data as a valuable asset, and applies technology 
and operations practices that are designed to ensure the security of this data 
both during transmission and while stored on our servers . Postini takes 
reasonable precautions to protect this data against loss, misuse, and 
alteration. To learn more, please see the <a href="http://www.postini.com/legal/security.php">Postini Security Statement 
</a>. 
</p><p><b><u>Service End User Privacy </u></b>
</p><p><strong><em>What Is Covered by This 
Section?</em> </strong> The paragraphs in this section provide information on 
how Postini uses and disseminates information collected about End Users of the 
Postini service through password-protected portions of our website, such as the 
Support Portal, the Administration Console and the Message Center, which are not 
covered by the section “Public Website Privacy” above. It does not cover any 
other data processing activities. In the password-protected portions 
of our website, we observe the following privacy practices: 
</p><p><b><i>Personal Information About End Users is Supplied to Postini by their 
Email Service Providers </i></b>. Postini does not require End Users to provide 
personal contact or demographic information. The only information Postini 
obtains about an End User is the End User’s email address and the End User’s 
configuration settings, as well as certain information in email messages that 
are or may be linked to End Users. Information about an End User’s email address 
is provided to Postini as a result of our customer relationship with the End 
User’s email service provider. This information, as well as all the other data 
that Postini obtains about End Users, is controlled by the email service 
provider, not Postini. As such, if an End User wishes to correct or update his 
or her email address, the End User must contact his or her email service 
provider directly. 
</p><p><b><i>End User Control of Configuration Settings.</i></b> An End User 
controls his or her own message delivery configuration settings through the 
Message Center. If an End User wishes to correct or update his or her 
configuration settings, the End User must enter new configuration settings in 
the Postini Message Center. An End User can also deactivate his or her Postini 
services at any time by turning the configuration settings in the Message Center 
to the OFF position. Once an End User does so, services will not be provided to 
the End User’s account and no new services be added to the End User’s account. 
</p><p><b><i>Passwords and Message Content </i></b>. To log in to the Message Center 
for the first time, an End User must use the password provided by Postini, which 
is automatically generated. This password is not released to any party other 
than authorized personnel of the End User’s email service provider, except as 
described herein. After the End User logs in for the first time, the End User 
will be prompted to enter a personalized, secret password. This password is not 
released to any other party. End User configuration settings and email messages 
are processed automatically by Postini’s software, and humans do not review this 
information except as required by law or with the consent of the End User’s 
email service provider. All End User-specific information and email message 
information, including content, addresses, categorizations, and IP addresses, is 
kept confidential. Postini delivers its services in compliance with the existing 
service agreement between Postini and the End User’s email service provider (and 
End Users derive no legal rights from such agreements). 
</p><p><a name="OLE_LINK1"></a><a name="OLE_LINK2"><b><i>Contact Update.</i></b></a> 
Our customers designate administrators with respect to the Postini service. 
These designated administrators may review and edit the contact information for 
their company directly by using the Contact Update feature, which will be 
available soon, in the Postini Support Portal. 
</p><p><b><i>Email Communications.</i></b> For End Users with direct access to the 
quarantine area of the Message Center, Postini will provide email notification 
when emails with viruses and other email are quarantined in the Message Center 
on a schedule that may be determined by the End User or his or her email service 
provider. 
</p><p><b><i>Use of Cookies.</i></b> Postini uses cookies to store the name, email 
addresses, and configuration settings of End Users for session management. Other 
than email address and configuration settings, these cookies do NOT hold any 
personal information. 
</p><p><b><i>Framed Environments.</i></b> If an End User’s email service provider 
displays the Message Center in a “framed” environment, Postini cannot guarantee 
the privacy practices of that email service provider. In this case, the End User 
must contact his or her email service provider directly to obtain information 
about the privacy policies of his or her email service provider.

</p><p>
<a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor"><img src="/images/truste_safeharbor.gif" alt="" width="116" height="41" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="right"></a></p><p><strong><em>What Is Covered by This Section?</em></strong> The paragraphs 
in this section describes how Postini collects, uses, and discloses EU Personal 
Data, which is certain personally identifiable information that Postini receives 
in the United States about individuals in the European Union. Postini complies 
with the US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles as set forth by the U.S. 
Department of Commerce (“EU Safe Harbor”), with respect to EU Personal Data that 
it obtains about (i) Public Website visitors, (ii) individuals who are employed 
by or act on behalf of customers, suppliers, and business partners (“Business 
Contacts”), and (iii) end users of Postini services and individuals referenced 
in emails covered by the services (“EU Emailers”). For further background and 
information about the EU Safe Harbor, please refer to the U.S. Department of 
Commerce’s website at <u><a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor</a></u>. 
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>Public Website Visitors.</i></b><b> </b>Postini 
generally collects, uses, and discloses information about Public Website 
Visitors located in the EU in accordance with the section “Public Website 
Privacy” above. 
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>Business Contacts.</i></b><b> </b>Postini may obtain 
various types of EU Personal Data about Business Contacts. Such data may include 
identifying information (names, titles, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and 
email addresses); information about products and services ordered or provided; 
financial and payment information; and other transaction-related data. 
</p><p class="MsoNormal">Postini may use these types of EU Personal Data for 
legitimate business purposes, including to deliver or provide products or 
services; to establish or maintain customer and business relationships; to 
perform accounting functions; and to conduct other activities as necessary or 
appropriate in connection with the servicing and development of the business 
relationship. 
</p><p class="MsoNormal">Business Contacts should email or otherwise contact Postini 
if any of their EU Personal Data changes, or if they would like to access and 
correct EU Personal Data that Postini may maintain about them. In many 
instances, such access may be obtained through the newsletter updates and 
comparable procedures described in the section “Public Website Privacy” above. 
For other requests, Business Contacts may contact Postini as explained at the 
end of this EU Safe Harbor Privacy Statement. Also, to the extent that any 
Business Contacts receive marketing and or customer support communications from 
Postini, and wish to unsubscribe or otherwise stop receiving such 
communications, they can follow the instructions in such communications to 
unsubscribe. 
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>EU Emailers.</i></b><b> </b>Postini provides a wide 
variety of services to its customers that facilitate the detection and filtering 
of spam and other unwanted emails. In the course of providing these services, 
Postini may obtain access to EU Personal Data about EU Emailers of the services. 
Such data may include name and email address, and other information in the 
emails covered by the services. Wherever Postini obtains or otherwise processes 
EU Personal Data about an EU Emailer, Postini acts as a mere data processor on 
behalf of its customer (the email service provider to the End User of the 
Postini service). The email service provider is the controller of the EU 
Personal Data, and Postini therefore processes such data strictly in accordance 
with the email service provider’s instructions and pursuant to its contractual 
arrangements with the email service provider as Postini’s customer. 
</p><p class="MsoNormal">If you are an End User of Postini services, and you wish to 
access your Message Center Account or adjust the application of the email 
filtering solution to your email account, you should follow the instructions 
provided by your email service provider. In addition, if you need to update or 
change the email address or other EU Personal Data that Postini may maintain 
about you, you should contact your email service provider for such changes. In 
turn, the email service provider will generally update the information that it 
provides to Postini for purposes of delivering the email filtering services. 
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>Other Necessary Disclosures.</i></b><b> </b>Postini 
may disclose EU Personal Data to processors, or agents, as necessary in 
connection with the performance of requested services or solutions, or as 
otherwise appropriate in connection with a legitimate business need. Postini may 
also disclose EU Personal Data as necessary and legally permissible in 
connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business. In these 
situations, Postini will require the recipient of the data to protect the data 
in accordance with the relevant principles in the EU Safe Harbor, or otherwise 
take steps to ensure that the EU Personal Data is appropriately protected. 
Postini may also disclose EU Personal Data where required or permitted by law, 
or where Postini believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection 
with a law enforcement request. 
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>Data Security and Integrity.</i></b><b> </b>Postini 
takes reasonable precautions to protect EU Personal Data from loss, misuse and 
unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Also, to the 
extent necessary or appropriate consistent with its role as a mere data 
processor, Postini makes reasonable efforts to keep EU Personal Data reliable 
for its intended use, accurate, current, and complete. </p>
