                    <div>Privacy Policy Statement<br>
This is the web site of HimalayaIT.<br>
<br>
Our postal address is<br>
000 W End Ave 00<br>
New York NY 10000<br>
We can be reached via e-mail at admin@domainprivateregistrationinfo<br>
Telephone: 347-913-5920<br>
<br>
We respect your interest in your privacy and as a result we have created <br>
this informational disclosure. <br>
 <br>
We collect and use personal information for many purposes, including but <br>
not limited to, billing; product and service fulfillment; to better <br>
understand our customer needs; to provide a better website, products and <br>
services; to communicate with customers and potential customers regarding <br>
our products and services and third party products and services. <br>
 <br>
Generally, your private information will only be disclosed to our owners, <br>
employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries, partners, affiliates, <br>
attorneys, consultants, business associates, service providers, suppliers <br>
and agents, acting on our behalf or request. This general rule, and <br>
disclosures in specific situations, is more particularly described below. <br>
 <br>
You must be at least 18 years old to access this website. We do not direct <br>
this website to persons under 18, nor do we knowingly collect any personal <br>
information from children under the age of thirteen. <br>
 <br>
Information Collected by our ISP <br>
 <br>
The hosting provider for this Internet site (as with any Internet site) has <br>
the ability to record various information, including domain name, pages <br>
accessed, date and time of access, web browser type and computer operating <br>
system, and referring information, and to disclose this information. This <br>
is most commonly done by providing access to raw server logs. For more <br>
information you should perform an Internet search on 'server logs' or 'raw <br>
server logs.' We may have access to our raw server logs and access reports <br>
prepared by our hosting provider. <br>
 <br>
Financial Information for Billing Purposes <br>
 <br>
We sell products and services. When sales are made financial information <br>
must be disclosed. This information can include any number of facts you are <br>
asked to provide, but most commonly includes your name, financial / credit <br>
card information, billing address, and email address. Generally, this <br>
purchase information will be provided by you to a third party payment <br>
processor and we do not receive your financial / credit card information. <br>
 <br>
In the event we do receive financial / credit card information, we will not <br>
disclose it to anyone unless disclosure is required by law or a court <br>
order, or unless disclosure is required to address an issue implicated by <br>
the financial transaction. If you claim that your financial information <br>
was used to make a purchase you did not authorize, details about the <br>
financial transaction may be disclosed to law enforcement and anyone else <br>
we deem necessary to address the matter. <br>
<br>
Use of eMail Addresses and other Contact Information <br>
 <br>
An important part of our services includes being able to provide <br>
information to you. As a result, you expressly consent to receiving <br>
communications from us via email, fax, telephone, mail, text, SMS, or any <br>
other delivery method, including to your cell phone. <br>
 <br>
As a customer you are agreeing to receive information about the product or <br>
service you purchased. This may include, but is not limited to, information <br>
about product or service updates, new features, or information we believe <br>
you may find interesting. <br>
 <br>
We may also send you information about other products and services our <br>
company offers. <br>
 <br>
We will not sell, provide, or transfer you email address to others. <br>
 <br>
We may allow advertising to our customers, or engage in joint ventures, <br>
which result in your receiving advertisements from selected third parties. <br>
 <br>
Identification of Purchasers <br>
 <br>
If you purchase one of our products or services, you authorize us to use <br>
your name and identification information in advertising or promotions. <br>
 <br>
We also use personal information in an aggregate form (i.e., not <br>
individually attributable to you) for business analysis, operational, <br>
marketing and other promotional purposes. <br>
 <br>
Unless we provide access to a membership area, account, or provide an <br>
ability to have and change a username, password, email address, or other <br>
similar information, we do not have the capability to allow users to review <br>
and request changes their personal information. <br>
 <br>
Cookies and Tracking <br>
 <br>
Cookies may be used to keep track of referred affiliate commissions and to <br>
monitor access to our website. You consent to any future use of cookies <br>
for testing purposes and the use of cookies for publicly available data to <br>
gather statistics for the purpose of determining which search engines, <br>
referring sites, key words, etc., bring visitors to our website, which <br>
pages visitors are most interested in, what web browsers are used, etc. <br>
Various providers may be used for this purpose. The purpose is to obtain <br>
information that will help promote the website, make the website more <br>
interesting and useful to visitors, and to identify areas where improvement <br>
is needed. <br>
 <br>
Our website does not respond to “do not track” requests from a web browser <br>
or other device, or other similar requests or procedures. <br>
 <br>
Additionally, various third party information suppliers and other entities <br>
that provide information for this website, or for use by us, may use <br>
cookies. Examples include, but are not necessarily limited to billing <br>
providers, third party advertisers, and third party resources we promote. <br>
<br>
We may also allow third party advertisers to display ads on our website. <br>
We are not in a position to know if they collect identifiable information <br>
about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across <br>
different websites, so you should assume they do. In most web browsers you <br>
can choose not to accept cookies from third party sites or third-party <br>
cookies. <br>
 <br>
Disclosure by Necessity <br>
 <br>
Private information may be disclosed if required by a court order, statute, <br>
law, or regulation. <br>
 <br>
Information is subject to disclosure to address a claim that you are <br>
violating the terms of any agreement pertaining to your use of your use <br>
this website or our products or services, or rights of any third party. <br>
 <br>
Information is also subject to disclosure if we believe that disclosure is <br>
necessary to identify, contact or bring an action against someone who may <br>
be causing injury to or interfering (either intentionally or <br>
unintentionally) with our rights or property, your rights or property, <br>
other users of our website, products or services, or anyone else. <br>
 <br>
As we continue to develop our business, we or our affiliates may sell or <br>
buy other businesses or entities, or we may merge with another company, or <br>
be bought by another company. In such transactions, personal information <br>
may be one of the transferred assets. <br>
 <br>
Your information may be stored and processed in any country in which we <br>
maintain facilities or conduct operations. By using our website, products <br>
and services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of <br>
your country. <br>
 <br>
After your account becomes inactive your information may remain in our <br>
databases, computers, and archives, and cannot reasonably be expunged. <br>
 <br>
Policy Changes <br>
 <br>
These policies may be amended by us at any time and without notice, but <br>
will be posted at this page. <br>
 <br>
You agree that your continued use of our websites, product or service after <br>
that date will constitute your consent and acceptance of the amendment. <br>
