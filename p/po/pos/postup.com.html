<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
PostUp, Inc. (“PostUp” or “We”) is committed to protecting online user privacy.  In order to ensure your privacy while using this website, we collect your information only in the manner and for the purposes described below.  This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) informs you about the ways in which PostUp knowingly collects and uses information collected via its website (at <a href="/">http://www.postup.com</a>)  and via its Services and APIs.  Capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meaning as designated in the PostUp Terms of Service located at <a href="/terms">http://www.postup.com/terms</a>, unless otherwise specifically defined in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>
“Personal Information” means information about you that is personally identifiable, such as your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.  It may also include information specifically related to the Company’s Services, including but not limited to content you create for the Services, your online profile or other biographical information, information on your selected bids and keywords, and the fact that you are a user of the Service.
</p>
<p>“Non-Personal Information” means information that does not personally identify you and cannot be used to contact you or identify you (for example, your IP Address or browser type).
</p>
<p>
“Information” means both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.
</p>
<h3>Information Collected</h3>
<h4>Personal Information</h4>
<p>
When we collect Personal Information via the Site, it is only done with your knowledge (such as filling out a submission form).  This Personal Information may include your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, birth date, credit card information, content you create for the Services, your online profile or other biographical information, information on your selected bids and keywords, and the fact that you are a user of the Service.
</p><p>
Examples of where we might gather such information from you: when you sign up to receive e-mail updates or newsletters about the Site, our products, or services; to allow you to register or update your individual information on the Site; to help personalize the Site for you; or to allow you to provide feedback, or ask a question.  In some situations, you will need to provide some or all of the above-described Personal Information in order for certain personalized features of the Site to function properly (e.g., company and product email alerts).
</p>
<h4>Non-Personal Information</h4>
<p>
We also collect and store Non-Personal Information, such as visitor traffic, page hits, site referral information, browser information, downloads, and general Site use information through typical Internet data collection tools, such as web beacons, cookies, and embedded Web links. These tools collect information that your browser sends to our Site, such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at this Site, and can track clickstream behavior (i.e. the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take in using the Site). We use this Non-Personal Information to better understand the use of the Site, to improve and revise the Site and to track interest.
</p>
<p>
We may use cookies to store your Site preferences, usage patterns, and other information so that the Site, and the Sites and tools of our partners, will function better for you on subsequent visits.  The Site or its partners may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and for other similar purposes.  A “cookie” is a tiny file that your browser places on your computer’s hard drive, which acts to identify your computer.  Cookie and cookie tracking technology is useful for gathering information such as browser type and operating system, tracking the number of visitors to the Site and partner sites, and understanding how visitors use the Site.  Cookies can also help tailor the Site and partner sites to visitors’ needs and help customize the Site and partner sites for visitors.  Personally identifiable information cannot be collected via cookies and other tracking technology; however, if you previously provided personally identifiable information (as discussed above), cookies may be tied to such information.  Aggregated cookie and tracking information may be shared with third parties.  Most modern browsers allow users to decide whether to accept cookies, but rejection of cookies may cause some parts of the Site to not function properly or be inaccessible.
</p>
<p>
PostUp also collects Personal and Non-Personal Information from commercially available sources that may be used along with the information PostUp collects when you visit the Site. For example, PostUp may compare the geographic information acquired from commercial sources with the IP address collected by data collection tools to derive your general geographic area.  If you elect to become an advertiser of the Company (an “Advertiser”), we may also gather information about you from sources such as blogs, Wikipedia, social media sites, and so on, inasmuch as these are publicly available.  The Company intends to use this information to present your provided Content in the most meaningful context to users of the Service, but does not make any guarantees as to how this information will be used.
</p>
<h3>Use of Information</h3>
<p>
PostUp may use Personal Information, for example your email address, to provide you with marketing or other communications.  PostUp may share your Information with its trusted business partners so they may also offer services that complement those provided by us or with third parties that assist us with this Site. For example, we may engage third parties to make improvements on our Site, to offer new products, to provide e-mail and other marketing support, and to allow us to customize your experience on the Site.  In addition, we engage another company to validate and process credit card payments. When we engage third party companies, they have access to Personal Information and Non Personal Information as needed to perform their functions, but they may not use it for other purposes.  We may disclose any Information to third parties if we believe release is necessary to comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order or to help prevent fraud or enforce or protect the rights and properties of PostUp or its affiliates.
</p>
<p>
Further, we may disclose Information if you opt-in (either at the time of providing personally identifiable information, or at a later time) to have us share your information with our partners for the purpose of receiving information from our partners and other companies.
</p>
<p>
In the event of an acquisition of all or part of PostUp by another company, or in the event that PostUp sells or disposes of all or a part of the PostUp business, the acquirer will have access to the information maintained by PostUp, which can include personally identifiable information, subject to applicable law. Similarly, information may be transferred as part of a reorganization or insolvency proceeding.
</p>
<p>
International Customers should note that the database of Personal Information is retained by PostUp in the United States. We may process information on servers outside of your country.  In addition, Personal Information may be shared with a third party to support services for us as described above, and such third party may store Personal Information on servers located in or outside the United States.
</p>
<p>
Although we use reasonable efforts to maintain the privacy of your personally identifiable data and information, due to technological limitations, and the risk of unlawful interceptions and accessing of transmissions and/or data, we cannot completely assure you, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable data and information, and any other electronically communicated information, will be absolutely confidential.
</p>
<h3>Opting Out</h3>
<p>
To unsubscribe from our mailing list(s), please follow the directions set forth within the promotional or other materials you receive from us or email us at <a href="mailto:opt-out@postup.com">opt-out@postup.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
If enabled on the site, you may visit your account settings page to delete your account and/or information. You can also contact us at <a href="mailto:remove@postup.com">remove@postup.com</a> to request deletion of your account and/or information. Please note that any information that we have may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after your deletion request. This may be the case even though no information about your account remains in our active user databases. Please note that log files are not affected by account deletion requests.
</p>
<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>
We maintain and review e-mail correspondence that you send to us.  We will use the personally identifiable information disclosed in the e-mail.  Because such correspondence contains information that is not transmitted through the operation of our web site, it is not subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h3>Information Processing</h3>
<p>
In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners, provided that we will not reveal such information except in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h3>Demographic Information and Surveys and Polls</h3>
<p>
We may ask for demographic or profile (age, gender, household, interests, etc.) information in a survey/poll or at registration. This information is used to assist us in tailoring the site, our communications, and our services and products to visitors and consumers. We may share aggregated demographic and survey information, as opposed to individual information, with third parties. You always have the option of not responding to any questionnaire, survey, or poll.
</p>

<h3>Credit Card Security</h3>
<p>
Providing you with a secure ordering experience is a high priority. When you submit an order to the Site, we encrypt your order information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software when it is transmitted for credit card processing. Encryption is a process by which software scrambles information in transit.  When confirming an order to you, we will reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
</p>
<h3>Linked Internet Web Sites</h3>
<p>
The Site may include hyperlinks or data that can take you to a third party website, document, file, or other materials. These third party sites contain their own, different privacy provisions. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting Personal Information to those sites. We are not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of information collected through these other web sites, and we expressly disclaim any and all liability related to such collection, use, or disclosure.
</p>
<h3>Children</h3>
<p>
Our Site is not directed towards children 13 years of age or under and we do not knowingly collect any information from children 13 years of age or under through the Site.
</p>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
Reference is made to the Terms of Service for the Site which shall apply to this Privacy Policy as if set forth in full herein. You may wish to review the Terms of Service at <a href="/terms">http://www.postup.com/terms</a>.  We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy periodically.  Any amendments made to this Privacy Policy will be considered effective ten (10) days after the amendments are posted on the site.
</p>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<p>
If you have any questions about our services or Privacy Policy, please contact PostUp, Inc., 130 West Union Street, Pasadena, CA 91103 or send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@postup.com">privacy@postup.com</a>.
