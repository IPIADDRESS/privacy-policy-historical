<p><strong>Privacy Policy revised as of 09/25/2012</strong></p>
<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of our visitor’s  personally identifiable information. To better protect your privacy, we  provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the  choices you can make about the way your information is used.</p>
<p>Your privacy is critically important to us.  If you  give us your name, email address, or  other information, we will use it  to communicate with you regarding your order  status or to share other  resources and offers.</p>
<p>You can unsubscribe from any communications  from us at any  time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link found at the  bottom of every automated  email we send.</p>
<p>Most payments are processed through  1ShoppingCart. which uses the most  advanced SSL Encrypted Security  technology available so your  information is always secure. See the “Security”  link for more details.</p>
<p><strong>What Information We Collect and How We Use It</strong></p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information – When supplying your information  or by placing an order for products or services, we collect certain  types of personally identifiable information including contact  information, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number,  Credit card and ID verification information, and bank account  information as applicable.</p>
<p>We use this information to process requests for products and services  by way of customer support for your guaranteed satisfaction. We also  use collected information to communicate with you, such as to notify you  (through e-mails, SMS text messages, and newsletters) about updates to  products, to send you order confirmations, or to provide you with  important product warranty or safety information.</p>
<p>In addition, we use contact information you provide to respond to  your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you, by means of e-mail  or through our newsletter, additional products, programs or services  that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>Supplementation of Information – We may, from time to time,  supplement the information we collect online with outside records (e.g.,  information from our Strategic Partners or from wireless providers) to  enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to  offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe  may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>We are able to offer our services to you, in part, based on your  willingness to be reached by our third party advertisers. We may sell  our user information and/or join together with other businesses to bring  selected opportunities to our members. By allowing us to make the  information you supply available to these third parties, you are able to  receive free information on products and services that may be of  interest to you.  We will use contact information from your registration  data to send you information about our products and services and to  keep you informed of our other products and services that may be of  interest to you. This information may also be shared with third party  advertisers who may contact you by means of e-mail, telephone, SMS text  message, or other sources of marketing.  We do not control, and are not  responsible for, the practices of our third-party advertisers.</p>
<p>By submitting your e-mail address at the Website or the website of  one of our marketing partners, and/or obtaining services from us, you  agree to receive e-mail or telephone calls, SMS text message,or other  marketing from us and/or  our third-party advertisers notwithstanding a  prior decision, made by you, to opt out of this or any other of our or a  third party affiliate of ours program, pursuant to the CAN-SPAM Act,  you are agreeing to opt back in and to receive marketing materials until  you decide to opt-out. In addition, you agree that such act constitutes  a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application for purposes of the  Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR §310 et seq. (the “ATSR”).  Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal  Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, We retain the right to contact you  via telemarketing or SMS text message in accordance with the ATSR.   Moreover, by registering with, or requesting information from, a  third-party advertiser at or through the Website or other advertisement  media made available by us (e.g., email marketing), such action shall  constitute a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application with the  respective third-party advertiser for purposes of the ATSR and you may  be contacted via email, direct mail, SMS text message, and/or  telemarketing by such third-party advertiser in accordance with the  ATSR.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing of Your information</strong></p>
<p>In addition, if you access donttreadhere.com through a third-party  site, such as one of our Strategic Partners’ sites, we also may need to  report certain personally identifiable information (e.g., name and  e-mail address) back to that Web site. As we explain further below in  the section that follows, we will tell you at the point of collection if  we will share personally identifiable information with the Strategic  Partner through which you access the HomeMailGroup.com website.</p>
<p>In addition, we will share aggregated demographic information with  our Strategic Partners. This is not linked to any personally  identifiable information.</p>
<p>Our Collection of Personally Identifiable Information Through a Third-party Web Site</p>
<p>To provide you with content and service, we have relationships with  many of the best service and content companies. As a result of these  relationships, you can access HomeMailGroup.com through a third-party  Web site. You can recognize most of the HomeMailGroup.com pages on  these third-party sites by looking for the joint branding of  HomeMailGroup.com and a third-party company. For example, if you see a  logo on the page that says “Powered by HomeMailGroup.com,” you are on  a co-branded page.</p>
<p>Whenever you provide registration information on a co-branded page,  that data may be shared with the third-party site through which you  access HomeMailGroup.com. If personally identifiable information may  be provided to such a third party, we will inform you at the point of  collection and provide you with an opportunity to tell us not to share  your personally identifiable information. We encourage you to read the  privacy policies of such third parties, as this Notice does not cover  their use of information.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about  our visitors when you visit many of our Web pages such as the type of  browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of  operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows ‘98 or Mac OS) and the  domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online,  EarthLink).</p>
<p>We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to  improve the design and content of our service pages and to enable us to  personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information  in the aggregate to analyze service usage.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Process/Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to  legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it,  for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law  enforcement agency’s request.</p>
<p><strong>Choices/Opt Out</strong></p>
<p>If you prefer not to receive marketing information or wish to fully  deactivate your account information from us, simply let us know by  choosing this OPT OUT link, or by sending a letter via certified mail to  Home Mail Group.com – 334 East Bay St #218. Charleston SC 29401. Attn: Customer  Service Manager. Please note that even if you chose to opt out of  DontTreadHere.com’s marketing, we will continue to send you important  service-related communications (e.g., order confirmation or product  safety information). However, these are not promotional in nature.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>To enhance your experience with our site, we may use “cookies.”  Cookies are used by your computer’s browser to store your preferences.  We use both session and persistent cookies. Cookies, by themselves, do  not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable  information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for  example, registering at one of our sites.</p>
<p>We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content  and offerings on our sites. If you set your browser not to accept  cookies, you will still be able to use our site.</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>In addition, our site contains links to other Web sites whose  information practices may be different than ours. Our privacy policy  does not cover these third parties’ use of information. Visitors should  consult the other companies’ and sites’ privacy notices as we have no  control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these  third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial  procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain  data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.</p>
<p>All information submitted is protected by our secure server, which  automatically encrypts your personally identifiable information so that  it cannot be read while traveling over the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Reviewing Your Information</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to review and update or correct the personally  identifiable information that we have collected from you online, simply  send your request via certified mail to Home Mail Group.com – 334 East Bay St #218. Charleston SC 29401. Attn: Customer  Service Manager.  To  protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help  verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>
<p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong></p>
<p>If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a  materially different manner from that stated at the time of collection,  we will notify you directly (e.g., via e-mail). You will have a choice  as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner.  In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices  that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we  will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the  change. However, if you have opted out of communication with the site  then you will not be contacted, nor will your personal information be  used in this new manner.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p>
