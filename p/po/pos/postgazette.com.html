<p class="body1"><span style="color:black">We collect information from you when you register on the Site, submit comments, photographs or other materials on the Site, place an order, or participate in another Site feature or access the site via a third party website such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>When signing up for, or registering to make submissions or otherwise use specific services, we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, credit card information or other information. You may, however, view our Site without providing such information.
</li>

<li>When participating in certain activities, such as commenting on a particular article, participating in an online chat, participating in an online poll, or otherwise sending messages through our web site, the comments, information, thoughts or ideas you provide may be published on the Site at the sole discretion of the Post-Gazette.
</li>

<li>
   In order to comment on articles appearing on the Site you may only do so through Facebook, by first logging onto Facebook (using your Facebook user name and password). Your use of the Facebook site is subject to Facebook's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (http://www.facebook.com/#!/legal/terms) as well as Facebook's Data Use Policy (http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/). If you access the Site via a website such as Facebook, we will have access to your profile information on such site. The Post-Gazette may collect any personal information regarding our visitors from Facebook as a result of such comments posted via Facebook.
</li>

<li>
   If you are an entity (such as a corporation, partnership or limited liability company) or an educational institution and you authorize your employees to access those portions of the Site that require a registration, one digital subscription will entitle each of your authorized employees to access those portions of the Site without the need for each employee to register individually, provided that such employees access such portions of the Site from a computer or other device with your institutional IP addresses for such devices that you have provided to us at the time of your registration.  While these employees will not need to register to access such portions of the Site if they do so on devices with the provided IP addresses, we may gather usage data and track IP addresses from such users without their individual consent.
</li>

<li>
   We use IP addresses and session identifiers to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track user activities, to infer user interests (including user interests in certain types of content), and to otherwise induce, deduce, and gather information about individual users and market segments.
</li>

<li>Like many web sites, we use
"cookies" to enhance your experience and gather information about
visitors and visits to our Site. Please refer to the "Do we use
'cookies'?" section below for information about cookies and how we use
them.</li>
<li>
	When subscribing to our digital subscription, the Post-Gazette will ask for your credit card information. Such credit card information is processed through a third-party vendor, Edgil Authentication Services (www.edgil.com). Once processed by Edgil, Edgil sends us a payment and a `token' - a 12-digit number associated with the customer, but not the credit card number that was forwarded to them. We do not store or otherwise share any such credit card information.
