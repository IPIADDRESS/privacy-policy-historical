                            of 13, and Digital Chicago does not knowingly collect 
                            PII from children under 13 years of age. If you are

                            about yourself to Digital Chicago. If Digital Chicago 
                            discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided 
                            Digital Chicago with PII, Digital Chicago will delete 
                            that child's PII from its system. <br>

                            that identifies the Web page visited prior and subsequent

                            Digital Chicago does not save PII in cookies, but 
                            we may link the cookie to any PII or other information 
                            we collect. In addition, we or our third party advertising 
                            networks may use cookies in connection with the serving 
                            of advertisements. For example, cookies may be used 
                            to control the number of times a user sees a particular 
                            advertisement or to target an advertisement to those 
                            users that will likely be the most interested in it. 
                            We do not have access to cookies set by third parties 
                            or the information that they may contain. <br>

                            Web Beacons. A Web beacon, which is sometimes also 
                            called a Web bug or "clear gif", is a small graphic 
                            image in a Web page, a Web-based document or an e-mail 
                            message, which generally allows the party that set 
                            the Web beacon to monitor certain information about 
                            the viewer of the Web page, Web-based document or 
                            e-mail message, and it may allow access to certain 
                            cookies. Web beacons are usually invisible to the 
                            user, because they are very small (generally 1-by-1 
                            pixel). However, in general, any electronic image 
                            viewed as part of a Web page, including an advertisement, 
                            can act as a Web beacon. Web beacons typically collect 
                            the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from, the 
                            type of browser requesting the Web beacon, the IP 
                            address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent 
                            to and the time the Web beacon was viewed. Web beacons 
                            can also be linked to PII. Digital Chicago may use 
                            Web beacons for a number of purposes, such as to count 
                            visitors to our Web pages or to monitor how our users 
                            navigate our site, and we may include Web beacons 
                            in HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters in order to count 
                            how many newsletters (or particular articles, links, 
                            etc.) we sent were actually opened. In addition, third

                            may use Web beacons. Digital Chicago does not have

                            and does not have access to whatever information they
