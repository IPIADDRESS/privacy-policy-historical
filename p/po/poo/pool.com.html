						<br>
						<b>Getting To Know Our Customers</b><br>
						<br>
						Pool.com is in the business of providing compelling, tailored services to our 
						customers. That requires more than simply offering innovative technical 
						services. It also requires that we understand you, our customer, and your 
						needs.<br>
						<br>
						We get to know you primarily through the information you provide to us when 
						signing up for, or using, one or more of our services. The information you 
						provide ranges from basic contact information and your payment information. The 
						application for domain backorder services is a representative illustration of 
						the information we request of you. All of the information we request from you 
						when purchasing our services is obligatory unless otherwise noted on the 
						relevant form. When you purchase our services, you agree to provide and 
						maintain accurate, complete and updated information.<br>
						<br>
						After you've signed up for our services, we may be in communication with you 
						about your account, technical questions you may have about services provided by 
						us, or other matters relating to those services. Those communications are 
						essential to our relationship with you and to our ability to provide you with 
						quality services that are responsive to your needs. At the same time, those 
						communications give us helpful insights about you, your preferences and the 
						ways in which we might improve our services. We therefore may maintain this 
						information for future use.<br>
						<br>
						Additionally, for operational and quality assurance purposes, we take note of 
						whether and how you use the information and services that we provide, such as 
						by recording site traffic patterns and by maintaining log files of users' 
						access to site files.
						<br>
						<br>
						The information we receive from or about you is stored on systems designed to 
						prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or 
						destruction of that information. We also encrypt your transmission of sensitive 
						information to us (e.g., credit card numbers, account passwords) in the 
						interest of heightened privacy protection and information integrity.<br>
						<br>
						By providing a domain backorder service, we gather and transmit to partner 
						registrars information about you that is required to complete a domain name 
						registration on your behalf. This information includes basic information about 
						each domain acquired through us, including the names, telephone numbers and 
						e-mail addresses of individuals designated as the owners of a given domain 
						name. Please see the Pool.com Terms and Conditions for additional information 
						that we require in order to complete a domain registration on your behalf, and 
						your obligations with respect to that information.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Information Corrections Or Changes</b><br>
						<br>
						You have the ability to correct or change certain information in our records, 
						such as your address and contact information. The instructions for doing this 
						can be found on our Web site at . You may change this information at any time 
						and as often as necessary. If you need assistance or have questions about 
						correcting information, you can contact us via e-mail.<br>
						<br>
						<b>How We Put Information To Good Use</b><br>
						<br>
						We use information about you for purposes of monitoring and improving our 
						internal operations, as well as to ensure that we: (i) bill you properly, (ii) 
						administer your account in accordance with your agreements with us and (iii) 
						properly perform the services you have requested.<br>
						<br>
						We also use the information we collect to monitor and improve our internal 
						operations, as well as to improve the experience of users in our network of 
						sites. For example, we may correlate Web site traffic information with data 
						about individual users. We may also break down overall usage statistics 
						according to customers' domain names, browser types, and MIME types by reading 
						this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's 
						browser).<br>
						<br>
						Another example of our use of information to enhance the experience of users in 
						our network of sites is our reliance on cookie files. We use cookie files to 
						make it easier for users to access our site or services. A cookie file is a 
						small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit 
						them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site 
						uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a 
						cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data 
						off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We use cookies 
						to track user traffic patterns (as described above) when you register for 
						Pool.com’s services. When you register, we may use a cookie to store a unique, 
						random user ID. We use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and 
						to track the pages you visit on our site. This type of temporary cookie lasts 
						only for your current session on our web page and is not used after your 
						session expires. We use it primarily to keep track of information during your 
						session, such as what services you have selected to register.<br>
						<br>
						If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will 
						receive the warning message with each cookie. You may refuse cookies by turning 
						them off in your browser; however, some of our sites may require a cookie for 
						access.<br>
						<br>
						Finally, we use the information we collect to direct important notices and 
						information affecting your account or services such as explicitly identified 
						email notifications regarding the status of backordered domains, keyword 
						alerts, auctions/bid statuses as well as confirmations of domain purchases. We 
						may also from time to time provide general information that may be of interest 
						to you, including surveys, contest and sweepstake announcements, and 
						information about our service or product offerings or the offerings of our 
						business partners and affiliates. You may opt out of receiving information from 
						us simply by notifying us of your desire in accordance with the opt-out 
						instructions contained in any information message you receive from us. Note, 
						however, that in order to fulfill our service obligations to you, we must 
						continue sending you notices and other important information affecting your 
						account or services.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>With Whom We May Share Information</b><br>
						<br>
						When you acquire a backordered domain through us, we must disclose information 
						about your domain name and your contact details with a partner registrar who 
						will be registering the domain for you. Our partner registrars, in turn, are 
						required to share such information with the domain registry. Our partner 
						registrars also currently make certain information about you available to the 
						general public via their domain name registration database look-up and 
						directory services. These services give users access to such data on a 
						query-by-query basis. Qualified persons may also access such data on a bulk 
						basis provided they agree, among other things, not to use the data to enable or 
						otherwise support the transmission of mass unsolicited commercial advertising 
						or solicitations via email; or (ii) sell or redistribute the data to third 
						parties. Please see the Pool.com Terms and Conditions for additional 
						information that we require in order to complete a domain registration on your 
						behalf, and your obligations with respect to that information. Please note, 
						that consistent with the current rules and policies for the Domain Name System, 
						information about you must remain available in the publicly accessible 
						registration database.<br>
						<br>
						We may share certain information about you with those of our vendors who are 
						responsible for handling your account or performing other necessary services 
						that you require. Although we may share sensitive financial information (i.e., 
						credit card numbers, banking information), security information (e.g., account 
						passwords) and personal communications (e.g., personal e-mail messages or 
						message board postings) with such vendors where necessary and appropriate, we 
						will not share such information with other third parties, except in response to 
						formal requests (e.g., subpoena or court order) made in connection with 
						reasonable dispute resolution mechanisms, litigation or arbitration proceedings 
						directly relating to a domain name registration or other services we provide. 
						In the event that certain services provided to you by or through Pool.com or 
						one of its business partners, are to be provided to you by a substitute service 
						provider, your information may be transferred to the substitute service 
						provider provided that such substitute entity agrees to be bound by the terms 
						of this privacy statement in effect at the time of performance of the services.<br>
						<br>
						Additionally, we may share your information, as well as other information that 
						is not of a sensitive nature, with carefully selected business partners, 
						including those who offer services that complement those provided by us or 
						which may otherwise be of interest to you. We may collect your information and 
						aggregate it with other data for statistical purposes, and share such 
						aggregated data with other business partners.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Our Accountability To You</b><br>
						<br>
						By purchasing our services, you obtain the protections of, and consent to the 
						data processing practices described in, this Privacy Statement. When you 
						purchase our services, you also represent to us that you have provided notice 
						to, and obtained consent from, any third party individuals whose personal data 
						you supply to us with regard to: (i) the purposes for which such third party's 
						personal data have been collected, (ii) the intended recipients or categories 
						of recipients of the third party's personal data, (iii) which of the third 
						party's data are obligatory and which data, if any, are voluntary, and (iv) how 
						the third party can access and, if necessary, rectify the data held about them.<br>
						<br>
						In addition to the privacy protections that we provide, our employees, agents, 
						business partners and affiliates are independently responsible for ensuring 
						compliance with this Privacy Statement, as described below.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Employee Accountability</b><br>
						<br>
						Only those Pool.com employees that have a legitimate business purpose for 
						accessing and handling personal information obtained by us are given 
						authorization to do so. The unauthorized access or use of such information by a 
						Pool.com employee is prohibited and constitutes grounds for disciplinary 
						action.<br>
						Additionally, our information management systems are configured in such a way 
						as to block or inhibit employees from accessing information that they have no 
						authority to access.<br>
						<br>
						<b>The Accountability of Pool.com's Agents and Business Partners</b><br>
						<br>
						Our trusted vendors, business partners and affiliates are responsible for 
						processing or handling some of the information that we receive. These vendors, 
						business partners and affiliates are not authorized to use such information for 
						purposes beyond those specified by us and are required to preserve the 
						confidentiality with which we treat such information.<br>
						<br>
						If you feel that Pool.com, or any of our agents, representatives or employees, 
						is violating this Privacy Statement, please contact us via e-mail at <a href="mailto:service@pool.com">service@pool.com</a>, by 
						telephone at (613)- 221-1210.<br>
